"(Jan 9, 2020  6:00 PM) Search-and-rescue teams thought they'd accounted for everyone who was skiing when an avalanche hit a resort in Idaho on Tuesday. But Silver Mountain Resort got a call Wednesday morning saying a family hadn't heard from relative who was there, NBC reports. The search resumed, and on Thursday, crews spotted a body from a helicopter, per Q13. That raised the death toll to three people; four people were injured.  There are no more missing people reported,  the resort posted on Facebook,  and rescue teams are returning to the base.  Three avalanches hit, the sheriff's office said. One skier had just punched a hole for air after being buried by the first avalanche when there was a second.  Just this rush of weight and snow came over, covered the hole that I had cleared for air,  Bill Fuzak said, adding that he then heard  this sick sound of everything coming to a stop.  Eventually, he passed out.  Next thing I knew, I felt snow being brushed away from my face and I heard voices.  He'd been in the snow for about 50 minutes.  It was just amazing the effort that was made to save us,  Fuzak said.",Death Toll Reaches 3 After Idaho Avalanche,Death Toll Reaches ____ After Idaho Avalanche,3,Trans( three ),1

"(Feb 8, 2015  7:43 AM) If it hadn't been for a new mother working from home, we might never have seen Toy Story 2—or any later Pixar film, for that matter, writes Simon Brew at Mental Floss. In his book Creativity Inc, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull tells the story of how most of the film was almost lost. An employee entered an erasing command into Pixar's systems—apparently in the wrong place, as the Next Web reported. The result was that the computers began to wipe the film data.  First, Woody's hat disappeared. Then his boots. Then he disappeared entirely,  Catmull wrote, per Mental Floss.  Whole sequences—poof!—were deleted from the drive.  Rebuilding the film  would have taken 30 people a solid year.  What's perhaps even more unbelievable is that Pixar didn't have a backup copy. That's because its backup system was down. But then a hero rode to the rescue: Galyn Susman, the film's supervising technical director, had recently had a baby and had been working from home—requiring her to take home a copy each week. She brought her whole computer into work, and the movie was saved. So, perhaps, was Pixar, Brew notes, since the then-small company had a lot riding on the movie. But the Next Web adds another wrinkle to the story: After that nightmare, the film was mostly destroyed again—this time intentionally. The film simply wasn't good enough, so it was rewritten and remade in a matter of months before its release.

"(Jul 26, 2019  12:30 PM CDT) US regulators are approving T-Mobile's $26.5 billion takeover of rival Sprint, despite fears of higher prices and job cuts. Friday's approval by the Justice Department and five state attorneys general comes after Sprint and T-Mobile agreed to conditions that would set up satellite-TV provider Dish as a fourth wireless company, so the number of major US providers remains at four, per the AP. Sprint and T-Mobile combined would now approach the size of Verizon and AT&T. The companies have argued that bulking up will mean a better next-generation  5G  wireless network than they could make on their own. Dish, meanwhile, is buying prepaid cellphone brands such as Boost and Virgin Mobile and some spectrum, or airwaves for wireless service, from the two companies. It will also be able to rent T-Mobile's network for seven years while it builds its own. DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim says the settlement sets up Dish  as a disruptive force in wireless.  The two companies tried to combine during the Obama administration but regulators rebuffed them. They resumed talks on combining once President Trump took office. The companies appealed to Trump's desire for the US to  win  a global 5G race with China as this faster, more reliable wireless is rolled out and applications are built for it. The GOP-controlled FCC agreed in May to back the deal. But public-interest advocates complained the FCC conditions didn't address the problems of the merger—higher prices, less wireless competition—and would be difficult for regulators to enforce. Attorneys general from 13 states and DC then filed a lawsuit to block the deal. They may not be satisfied with the settlement and choose to press ahead. A judge must also approve the DOJ's settlement.","DOJ Approves $26.5B Deal. Now, a 'Disruptive Force in Wireless'","DOJ Approves $____B Deal.

"(Aug 30, 2015  6:00 PM CDT) The migrants found dead in an abandoned truck in Austria appear to have died by suffocation under horribly tight conditions. Relying on early forensic tests, police say the 71 victims—including three children and a baby girl—ran out of air while packed five people per 10 square feet, Reuters reports. The refrigeration truck was designed to transport meat and apparently had no air holes.  We are still awaiting the final report from the forensic team, but it looks like they suffocated,  says a police spokesman. Meanwhile, police in neighboring Hungary have detained five people in connection with the deaths who could face 16-year sentences for human trafficking, the Wall Street Journal reports. The migrants are thought to be from Syria or Afghanistan. The tragic incident—and the massive flow of migrants moving through Europe—has put added pressure on officials to find solutions, Yahoo News reports. With Britain, France, and Germany pushing for a faster response, it was announced today that European Union home-affairs ministers will meet on Sept. 14 in Brussels. So far, European governments have talked about tougher trafficking laws and measures designed to dissuade migrants from attempting the trip without  a well-founded asylum claim,  the Journal says. Meanwhile, authorities found a five-year-old and two one-year-olds critically ill in a van in Austria along with 23 other migrants.

According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, 57-year-old Gary Simpson picked Carlie Trent up from her Tennessee school, telling staff her father had been in an accident. Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt  sick to my stomach  when she heard about those purchases.  I don't know what he's done to her,  she says.  I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.  Authorities believe Carlie is in  imminent danger.  Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth.  This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,  a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction.

SOLD has even helped New Yorkers with brunch waitlists, sample sales, and passports. And because he's paid for his time—$25 for the first hour, and $10 for every half-hour thereafter—long lines are likely a lot more welcome to him than they are to the rest of us. In fact, Samuel recently made nearly $1,000 when he spent 48 hours at the very head of the line for the iPhone 6, reports Salon, which calls the business part of the  Uber-ization of everything.  Since starting SOLD after getting laid off in 2012, Samuel now has 15 employees. He says he makes up to $1,000 a week, though the New York Times notes that because his business is  cyclical,  he currently also has a full-time job as a security guard. The line-waiting doesn't always sound pleasant. SOLD employee Adonis Porch tells Salon he's had to wait in hot weather, freezing weather, rain, sleet, and snow. Samuel says that while his customers can be superwealthy, most are just  everyday  people for whom time is a real commodity, reports CNBC.

The first Daytona 500 to be postponed took more than 36 hours to complete after rain pushed it from its scheduled Sunday afternoon start to yesterday at lunch, and ultimately turned it into the first ever NASCAR race run in prime-time television.

She spent a last evening in Basel with her life partner John that he describes as  tranquil and enjoyable. ... Gill had been thinking about it for years and I had no intention of spoiling it by getting emotional and heavy.

"(Jun 28, 2019  2:40 PM CDT) A University of Utah student who had been missing since June 17 is dead, Salt Lake City police said in announcing the arrest of a man they say killed her. Police said Ayoola Ajayi, 31, killed MacKenzie Lueck and burned her body. A SWAT team took Ajayi into custody Friday at an apartment complex on suspicion of aggravated murder, aggravated kidnapping, desecration of a body, and obstruction of justice, the Salt Lake City Tribune reports. Lueck, 23, vanished after returning to Salt Lake City after attending her grandmother's funeral in California. She took a ride-share from the airport to a park about 11 miles away and, police said, got into another car there, per CBS. That was the last time she was seen. Social media and phone records show that Ajayi was the last person Lueck communicated with, police say. Records show that their phones were both in the park within less than a minute of each other, per CNN. Witnesses told police that they saw Ajayi, who has no criminal history in Utah, burning something using gas in his backyard on June 17 and 18. A search found evidence, including human tissue and personal items of Lueck's, the police chief said. A friend and former roommate of Ajayi's was stunned by the allegations, saying the suspect projected an image of an educated, cultured professional. Ajayi’s LinkedIn profile says he worked in information technology for Dell, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Comcast, and the Army. He also modeled for fine art photographs, the profile says.

But as the Web has transformed into a more social entity, the terrorist organization is   stuck in 1.0,  writes analyst Daniel Kimmage in the New York Times. If America and its allies want to win the war on terror, they should look to YouTube. The early web was a haven for  anonymity and accessibility,  the central elements of al-Qaeda's distribution. But a social web that  can unite a fragmented silent majority  has been far less kind to Islamic extremists, blasting their propaganda on YouTube, social networks, and blogs.

Echols had been on death row. The men say they were convicted of murdering three 8-year-old boys in 1993 as part of a satanic ritual because police coerced a confession out of Misskelley, who the Appeal says is thought to be mentally challenged.

The plea deal was reached yesterday; in Brandon McInerney’s first trial, the jury deadlocked. In order to avoid a second trial, McInerney, now 17, pleaded guilty to second-degree and voluntary manslaughter, and prosecutors agreed not to pursue another trial—which could have potentially landed McInerney a life sentence.

Suspect Nakwon Foxworth, 33, who was with his pregnant girlfriend Jessica Hickling and their 4-month-old son, became angry at movers who were blocking the entrance with a barrel late Saturday night, the New York Daily News reports.  He took the stroller, with the baby in it, and started ramming it into the barrel,  one of the movers says, adding that Foxworth then pulled a gun—which he ultimately threw into the child's stroller. Foxworth—an ex-con who twice served time for attempted murder—took Hickling and the baby and went into their apartment, while the movers called police. As police were preparing for a standoff, Hickling managed to escape the apartment with her son around 12:30am. Foxworth quickly started shooting through the open door, just 10 feet away from police; officers later found a cache of illegal guns and ammo in his apartment. Foxworth was ultimately shot in the stomach and is in critical but stable condition; all of the injured officers (three shot in the leg and one in the face) are in good condition.

Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said charges had yet to be filed and it was too soon to say what the motive was. Authorities gave no details on the relationship between Godbolt and the victims.

Van Dyke's wife tells TMZ he died Friday at their ranch in Arkansas. She says his health had been declining since a car accident a few years ago. People reports Van Dyke's final television role was as Patricia Heaton's father on ABC's The Middle. He made his final appearance in 2015, capping an acting career that started more than 50 years earlier on The Dick Van Dyke Show by having Dick appear as his on-screen brother.

Jerry Van Dyke got his start as a stand-up comic but never found the success of his older brother. He appeared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Drew Carey Show, Fantasy Island, Raising Hope, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Judy Garland Show, and countless short-lived series. Until his role on Coach in the 1990s, Van Dyke was perhaps most famous for turning down the starring role on Gilligan's Island to instead star in My Mother the Car, which THR notes is  considered one of the worst shows in TV history  and was canceled after one season.

The tiny New Hampshire town is one of three that voted at midnight, and it has picked the eventual GOP nominee every year since 1968, though there was a tie in 1980 between George HW Bush and Ronald Reagan, and one between Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman in 2012, reports NPR.

Republicans have pushed a budget through Congress that provides an early but crucial victory in the effort. The budget prevents Democrats from using a Senate filibuster to derail a bill annulling and replacing the law. That's critical because it takes 60 votes to end filibusters, while Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority. The real work lies ahead. Republicans must decide which parts of Obama's statute to erase, what a new version should look like and how to protect 20 million people getting health coverage under the 2010 law. The House approved the budget Friday by a near party-line 227-198 vote. The Senate approved the measure Thursday.

South Korea, whose 19 million men spent an incredible $495.5 million on skincare last year—that's almost 21% of global sales. And they're on track to spend more than $885 million on cosmetics this year, according to one cosmetics company. We're not just talking skin cream, we're talking full-on makeup from foundation to eye pencil to lipstick.

Your appearance matters, so when I wear makeup on special occasions, it makes me more confident.  The AP traces the popularity of men's cosmetics—yes, there are specific brands for men—back to the 1990s. When a ban on Japanese goods was relaxed,  macho  South Korean men started to see their attitudes toward beauty change. By the early 2000s, more and more men aspired to be  flower men,  the attractive (and smooth-skinned) stars who hawked male cosmetics. Today, men in makeup are increasingly seen in ads around the country, and effeminate beauty is  a marker of social success,  says one expert.

Unfortunately, that's just kind of a normal cause of action in maritime law and this is the action that [was] advised to us and we need to take,  Glen Fritzler says. Per KSBY, Truth Aquatics also addressed the matter on Facebook, writing,  Regarding the lawsuit, as we are learning, this is another unfortunate side of these tragedies. This wouldn’t be something that we as a family would even consider, yet when something like this happens, insurance companies and numerous stakeholders convene and activate a legal checklist.  As Fox News explains, the lawsuit was filed  under a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law  that would allow the company to notify anyone who could make a claim against it that it is asserting it is not liable for damages; anyone served would then have a limited amount of time to challenge that assertion. The suit says the owners  used reasonable care to make the Conception seaworthy, and she was, at all relevant times, tight, staunch, and strong, fully and properly manned, equipped and supplied and in all respects seaworthy and fit for the service in which she was engaged.  The 1851 law was meant to bolster the shipping business and has been used successfully by owners of many crafts, including the Titanic.

It took a week of debate at the church's General Convention to bring in the changes, which include ditching terms like  wife  and  husband  for gender-neutral language, the Deseret News reports. The final product of the negotiations was a compromise that allows clergy to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies, which means that although such ceremonies may begin in some areas this fall, they are unlikely to be held in more conservative dioceses, Episcopal priest George Conger explains at the Washington Post.

The study, one of the first to examine smoking’s effect on the brain, surveyed 21,123 middle-aged people between 1978 and 1985, then followed them for an average of 23 years.

Those who smoked one or more packs a day saw a 44% increased risk, while those who smoked half a pack had a 37% increased risk. Middle-aged people who said they were ex-smokers did not exhibit a higher risk.

She says the memories  are buried beneath the horrific autopsy photos and crime scene footage I saw, the slurs I was called, the death threats I received (and still receive), the false accusations I fought, the years of wrongful imprisonment I endured, the multiple trials and slanderous headlines that juxtaposed our names and faces, unfairly interlocking her death with my identity.  Knox adds that  no one can ever give Meredith back her life, or me the years of life I lost to wrongful imprisonment.  She ends by acknowledging that mourning Kercher  comes at the price of being criticized for anything I say or don’t say today.

Federal buildings and the mall would remain under Congressional control, but the rest of the city would get to vote on becoming the first new state since Hawaii joined the Union in 1959.

Multiple 911 calls flooded in just before 1am reporting the shootings at the three-story, vacation-rental home located several blocks off the beach. Deputies found a sprawling crime scene: victims inside the home, outside and across the street from it, and in the street's median, the Bay County Sheriff's Office says. ABC News reports that witnesses helped ID David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, who has since been charged with seven counts of attempted murder and jailed awaiting a first court appearance. Daniels was at the time free on bond on a drug possession charge in Alabama, says Sheriff Frank McKeithen. No motive has been revealed; the shooting apparently began while partygoers were dancing. At least three people were critically injured, including Kearria Freed, 20, who was shot in the head. She was one of three students from Alabama A&M University among those shot. The school was told the students were innocent bystanders.

"(Mar 9, 2017  5:18 PM) After serving 32 years behind bars for arson and murders they didn't commit, Amaury Villalobos and William Vasquez are finally getting what one official calls  closure.  The two men wrongly convicted following a 1980 fire that killed a mother and her five children in a Brooklyn townhouse will each receive $9.7 million from New York City, plus an additional $5.75 million from the state, NYC comptroller Scott Stringer says, per the New York Times. The pair served 32 years in prison before being released on parole in 2012. Three years later, the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office ruled the fire an accident—possibly caused by residents burning heroin—and said the owner of the townhouse, a drug dealer, had lied about the men's involvement.  We have reached an agreement that recognizes the years these men spent incarcerated and allows them and their families closure,  Stringer said in a statement Friday, noting the men's case  represents the longest period of incarceration for any conviction vacated  by the Brooklyn DA’s Conviction Review Unit.  It's a significant settlement,  but  this is a case where the system completely failed these men,  says Vasquez's lawyer. He tells the New York Post he hopes the money will allow Vasquez to  pick up the pieces of his life.  The family of a third man, Raymond Mora, who was also exonerated of the crime following his death in prison in 1989, has not yet settled their claim with the city, reports the New York Daily News.

In response to the controversy that ensued this week after the chain started offering size 000, a spokesperson explained to Today,  We are simply addressing the demand coming from Asia for smaller sizes than what we had carried.  The company isn't the first to cater to this petite population—Nicole Miller introduced a size 0 for a 25½-inch waist 15 years ago due to demand from Asian customers in California, reports Time—but it's worth noting that only those with a 23-inch waist will fit into a J. Crew 000. Something called  vanity sizing  may also be at play—meaning sizing goes down even while the average woman is growing larger. Today, the average American woman is 5'4  and 155 pounds, which is 20 pounds heavier than in the 1970s, so she should be in a size 16—but vanity sizing puts her in a 10 or 12 instead, Newsweek explained a few years ago when  subzero  sizing first started popping up. Fashion blog Racked notes that J. Crew's new '000' is the equivalent of a size 32 in Italy, 1 in Japan, and 0 in Australia. As far as J. Crew is concerned, it's an XXXS, i.e., smaller than an XS (size 0) or an XXS (size 00). (Forget  vanity sizing —have you heard of  slimming underwear ?

After a four-week gambling hot streak collapsed in devastating fashion, the 36-year-old Fisher found himself hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and up to 50 pounds heavier. He tells the New York Post he was  broke, big, and isolated.  He attributes the weight gain to  amazing, wonderful, rich  casino food—double veal parms, full pizzas, single-serving chocolate cakes.  It was disastrous,  Fisher says. He was 245 pounds with 33% body fat. His friends bet him $1 million he couldn't get down to 10% body fat in six months. On June 22—five and a half months later—Fisher won the bet: He was 175 pounds with 8.8% body fat. It wasn't easy to get there. Fisher traded casino food for oatmeal, egg whites, and tilapia.

On Saturday, Ahmed tweeted a pic of his answer and the Stanford congrats letter. Not that Ahmed is incapable of using more than three words and a hashtag to explain why this issue is important to him.

This after a video of Drake with a 17-year-old fan was posted to Twitter late last week and has raised the Internet's collective eyebrow. In the clip, which TMZ reports is from a show at Colorado's Ogden Theatre in May 2010, Drake is seen on stage with a female fan. He smells her hair and appears to kiss her neck, then asks her age.

Kelly, which focuses on that singer's  decades of preying on young girls,  as the Daily Beast puts it. The outlet calls the Drake video  disturbing.

That soon went up to $40,000—and Gravity CEO Dan Price says it will be $70,000 by 2024. To mark the opening of a new Boise Gravity office, which the ChargeItPro employees will be transferred to, Price told the 40 workers that the minimum salary will go up to $50,000 immediately, followed by $5,000 raises in each of the next four years, the Idaho Statesman-Journal reports. The CEO raised the minimum pay for all workers at the company's Seattle headquarters to $70,000 in 2015 after reading a study that said happiness and general emotional well-being significantly increases with pay rises up until around $75,000, CNN reports. He cut his own $1 million salary to the same level to help fund the pay rises.

It's unclear how much money was lost by his fellow lawmakers, who he convinced to buy into the firm. Rep. Chris Collins is the largest shareholder and sits on the board of Innate Immunotherapeutics. On Tuesday, Innate stock dropped more than 90% after the firm announced its multiple sclerosis drug was a failure in clinical trials. According to CNBC, Innate stock hit a peak of $1.77 per share in January; it closed at 5 cents Tuesday.

The other lawmakers Collins successfully convinced to buy Innate stock are Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Bill Long of Missouri, Mike Conway of Texas, and Doug Lamborn of Colorado. The Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating Collins for possible insider trading. He helped write legislation to speed up clinical trials that could have benefited Innate in theory.

According to WSB, the teens were found lying next to their cars, and police believe they were killed behind the store. Police say the teens got to the store between 2am and 4am; the parents of both believed they were home in bed at the time. No arrests have been made, but police have  several leads  and are reviewing security camera footage, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. Both teens were preparing to start their senior year, Henderson at Roswell High School and Davis at River Ridge High School. Henderson was an honor student and member of the school's color guard. The Roswell band director called her  a fun, smart, talented young woman who was loved by so many.  Davis played football and lacrosse at River Ridge.

"(Sep 21, 2015  5:39 AM CDT) Three words helped seal the prosecution's case against former peanut company boss Stewart Parnell—and they may send him to prison for the rest of his life.  Just ship it,  wrote Parnell in 2007 to a plant manager worried about tainted products, CNN reports. A subsequent salmonella outbreak involving Peanut Corporation of America's products sickened more than 700 people and was linked to nine deaths. Parnell was convicted last year of 72 counts relating to the sale of tainted peanut products and faces a sentence of up to 803 years when he's sentenced today, reports the AP, which notes that the federal judge has the option of imposing a lesser sentence. Parnell's brother Michael, who helped fake lab test results, is due to receive a lesser sentence, as is former plant manager Mary Wilkerson. Food safety violations usually result in misdemeanor charges, and Parnell is the first person convicted of a federal felony in such a case, CNN notes. The potential life sentence is unprecedented, and Parnell's lawyer says it is  absurd.  Randy Napier, who lost his 80-year-old mother to salmonella poisoning linked to tainted peanut butter, disagrees.  We need to send a message to these food manufacturers,  the North Carolina man tells the AP.  No one else should have to go through what we did, watching my mother die. I'm hoping to have closure.

"(Jun 23, 2011  8:40 AM CDT) One fairly obvious way to lessen your chances of dying in a car crash: Don't take drugs before getting behind the wheel. Researchers found that a full 25% of drivers who died in single-vehicle accidents between 1999 and 2009 tested positive for drugs, USA Today reports. Of those studied, 22% tested positive for stimulants, 22% for marijuana, and 9% for narcotics. Alcohol doesn't help either: 37% of the dead drivers studied had blood alcohol levels over the legal limit of .08. And though combining drugs and alcohol is certainly not recommended, researchers found that it made no difference in the drivers' level of impairment:  When a driver is drunk, it doesn't matter what drugs are in their system. The alcohol takes over,  says a co-author. Even so, one activist points out that more attention should be paid to  drugged driving separate from the alcohol problem.

Described by the BBC as  one of the most successful invasive species ever,  the the brown tree snake is believed to have first slithered onto the 30-mile-long US territory 60 years ago, likely carried there during World War II via equipment from Papua New Guinea that was sent to Guam for processing.

At that point, she didn't think much about what to do next.  She was overcome by the moment and began to yell out that he was the man who had raped her six years earlier,  the Fulton County district attorney's office said in a statement, per Fox News. Police then arrested Antonio White, 54, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole following his rape conviction on Friday. The woman, who had only described the crime to friends and family at the time, told authorities how she had accepted a ride from White, whom she recognized as having lived in her former neighborhood. Rather than take her home, White drove the woman to an abandoned house and chased her with a gun as she tried to escape, ultimately pulling her back into the vehicle by her hair. Prosecutors say he raped her in the vehicle and threatened to kill her.

Police are saying very little about the letter's contents, but they hope the author will reach out again and perhaps end the mystery of what happened to Bernard  Bunny  Ross, reports the Bangor Daily News. Police say Ross, then 18, vanished on May 12, 1977, after taking the family car to his aunt's house in Presque Isle, then stealing another car near her home. It was found about 20 miles away, and Ross has been a missing person since. His parents—Bernard Sr., 80, and Carol, 78—say he'd been going through  ups and downs  at the time, but nothing out of the ordinary. The unsigned letter arrived after a local newspaper story about missing persons a few months ago mentioned their son, reports the Portland Press Herald. The letter writer claimed to have information about the disappearance, but police aren't divulging details.  I’ve never had anything like this happen in my career,  says Maine State Police Lt.

Federal prosecutors say Harbir Parmar picked the woman up the night of Feb. 21 to drive her from Manhattan to her home in White Plains, about an hour away. But when she fell asleep, prosecutors say, Parmar changed the destination to Boston. The woman told investigators that she woke up to find  his hand under her shirt touching the top of her breast,  the AP reports. She said she reached for her phone, but he took it and began driving again. He refused to take her to a police station and eventually left her by the side of an interstate in Connecticut.

If legislators don't take a break from fiscal cliff negotiations/posturing and pass a new farm bill by Jan. 1, the government will be forced to abide by a 1949 law that would force it to buy milk at roughly double the current market price, the New York Times points out. The inflated price tag would spur dairy farmers to sell to the government instead of the commercial market. That would lead to shortages that would push milk prices as high as $6 to $8 a gallon, explains the Times, up from a current average of $3.65. That new government price would be calculated in part using 1949's almost entirely by-hand milk production costs. Today, milk is much cheaper to produce, so farmers would reap a windfall profit. But it would also drive producers of products like butter, cheese, and yogurt, to find an alternative, like imported milk.

"(Jul 3, 2018  10:05 AM CDT) The United States Postal Service's money woes just got $3.5 million worse, and the Statue of Liberty is to blame. A judge ruled last week that the agency did commit copyright infringement when it used an image of Robert S. Davidson's Statue of Liberty on a stamp it issued in 2011. The Lady Liberty that towers over New York Harbor was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi; Davidson's replica stands before the New York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, reports Fast Company. The Washington Post (which has an image of the stamp) in December 2013 reported that the USPS had obtained the image from Getty Images but didn't also seek permission from Davidson, likely because the USPS assumed what it was using was in the public domain. Not so. A stamp collector had identified the mix-up in 2011, and the USPS was made aware—but then it printed another 1.13 billion of the stamps on top of the 3.5 billion it had already made, reported Artsy in 2017. As such, the suit claimed the infringement was knowingly committed. Identical copies of works in the public domain (which the statue is) aren't covered by copyright infringement protections. But Davidson argued in his suit that he wasn't trying to create a replica but rather to craft a fresher, more feminine version. Per the ruling,  he envisioned his mother-in-law as inspiration ... and viewed her picture every night during the construction of the face of the statue.  The judge ruled the  plaintiff succeeded in making the statue his own creation, particularly the face.  The amount owed: $3,554,946.95 in royalties, plus interest.

Superior Court Judge Marc Kelly's reasoning? The perp—convicted Dec. 3 of sodomizing a child younger than 10 and lewd or lascivious acts with a minor—didn't mean to hurt her.  [This] is not typical of a predatory, violent, brutal sodomy of a child case,  Kelly said, per the Orange County Register.  Mr. [Rojano] did not seek out or stalk [the victim]. He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage. He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm [the victim] when he sexually assaulted her.  The deputy DA agreed with just part of that, arguing that on June 4, 2014, the toddler—said by the Register to be related to Rojano-Nieto—entered the garage and that as Rojano-Nieto assaulted her, he covered her mouth when her mother tried to enter the locked garage and restarted the abuse once the mom left. That didn't seem to sway Kelly, who noted that Rojano-Nieto had grown up in a  dysfunctional  family with  disruption and abuse, making him an insecure, socially withdrawn ... and extremely immature young man with limited self-esteem.  The judge added Rojano-Nieto has shown  extreme remorse  and that  although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child. There was no violence or callous disregard for [the victim's] well-being.",Judge: Sex Offender 'Didn't Intend to Harm' 3-Year-Old,Judge: Sex Offender 'Didn't Intend to Harm' ____-Year-Old,3,Copy( 3 ),0

Most of the victims of the stampede, whose force was so great that it knocked down a gate, were women and children. About 44 worshipers were injured in the crush of people at the temple, which belongs to a popular local religious leader. Thousands of farmers and villagers had gathered there around noon to receive free goods to mark the anniversary of the death of the leader's wife.

The price tag doesn't include the costs of repairs to the lawn during the two-month encampment and the fountain outside City Hall. Time-and-a half overtime for the regular force and General Services cops who patrol parks cost the city a total of just over $1.5 million. As much as $1.7 million of the total costs will be added to the city's expected $72 million debt, reports the Los Angeles Times. The rest will be covered by standard operating costs. By comparison, the 2009 Michael Jackson single-day memorial service at the Staples Center cost the city $3.2 million. The city attorney is considering suing protesters to recover the cost of damages caused by demonstrators outside City Hall. An Occupy LA spokesman called the city's figures for the protest  outrageous,  and accused LA of making protesters scapegoats for the excessive use and cost of the police.

When a 40-year-old Florida woman suffered from one after a routine cesarean section in late September, medical staff caught it in time to perform CPR. After 45 minutes taking turns doing chest compressions to manually keep her heart beating and shocking her intermittently to try to jump-start her pulse, they were ready to pronounce the time of death and called in the woman's distraught family. Then, just as they stopped all life-saving procedures and turned to the heart monitor, Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro's heart started beating on its own, reports the South Florida Sun Sentinel.  She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death,  the hospital spokesman tells the AP.

According to CBS 12, Staff are calling it the hospital's  second miracle.

Taylor was convicted for a 1970 blaze that killed 28 people and destroyed a historic hotel in Tucson. The then-teenager was in the hotel, even though he wasn't a guest, and had a matchbook in his pocket. He told police during what he recalled as  very tough  interrogations that he'd seen someone else start the fire, CNN recounts. Taylor was sentenced to life in prison. But the judge has long expressed skepticism about the case, telling 60 Minutes recently that the evidence wasn't strong enough to convict—he's even sent Taylor Christmas gifts and law books, the AP reports. Forensic experts, meanwhile, have said that the original trial's experts  used methods no longer valid in the science of today  to declare the blaze as arson.  Today, all that media scrutiny finally resulted in action, as Taylor entered a plea of no contest, in a deal that will see him released from prison at last.",Man to Go Free 43 Years After Shaky Arson Conviction,Man to Go Free ____ Years After Shaky Arson Conviction,43,"Subtract( 2013 , 1970 )",1

But the quiet appears to be over, with Israel reporting three rockets fired from Gaza, reports AP. Just before the ceasefire expired at 8pm local time (1pm EDT), Israel agreed to extend it for another four hours, but Hamas rejected the idea, reports the Jerusalem Post. Earlier today, families in Gaza emerged from shelters during the 12-hour lull to survey damage, bury their dead, and stock up on supplies.

The mother's live-in boyfriend, Adolphus Earl Kimrey II—already facing charges including concealing a death and obstructing justice—was on Wednesday charged with first-degree murder and felony child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury or death after an autopsy and toxicology tests showed Mariah died of chloroform toxicity, reports People.

Authorities have yet to paint a clear picture of what happened in the hours before Kristy Woods found her daughter missing on the morning of Nov. 27 and remain tight-lipped as the investigation continues. Kimrey previously told police he checked on Mariah before leaving the family home for a short period during the night. Mariah wasn't seen again until her body was pulled from a creek 30 miles from the home five days later, per WRAL.

With the Dodd-Frank Act empowering whistle-blowers, Obama's administration has paid them $1.6 billion so far, and lawyers have taken up to 40% of that.  Increasingly, this is not just about exposing wrongdoing,  says an analyst.  It is about trying to generate as much money and fees for the firms handling the cases.  In fact, top laws firms have helped SEC officials forge whistle-blower rules and later hired them on as lawyers. At the same time, the federal government has collected $13.2 billion from companies whose fraud was exposed by whistle-blowers—and the lawyers who have raised more than $3 million for Obama insist they're doing it out of admiration.

Vescovo, a 53-year-old private equity investor from Texas, has become the first person to visit the deepest spots in all five of the world's oceans; that includes the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on the planet, the BBC reports. His dives in the DSV Limiting Factor, a prototype deep-diving submersible launched from the DSSV Pressure Drop, also included a visit to the wreck of the Titanic. The team says the 10-month-long  Five Deeps Expedition  discovered at least 40 new species and collected bottom-water samples for scientific analysis.

Foray was the best-known woman among the voice performers who contributed so much to the classic cartoons of Warner Bros., Disney, Hanna-Barbera, and other studios.

This will teach you next time, don’t drive in the water,  Donna Reneau told her, the recording shows.  I don't see how you didn’t see it, you had to go right over it. So?  Stevens had drowned by the time first responders reached her, NWAhomepage reports.  I completely understand the disgust and concern  about the dispatcher's response, Fort Smith's interim police chief said.  It’s a tragic thing, I understand that.  Reneau had already resigned as a 911 dispatcher and was working her last shift. She was on the phone with Stevens, 47, for more than 20 minutes as the water rose, per the Democrat-Gazette; more than 4 inches of rain fell on Fort Smith that morning. Still, Reneau berated her, sometimes yelling.  I don’t know why you’re freaking out,  she said at one point. Reneau is a certified dispatch training officer who had worked as a Fort Smith dispatcher for five years. Officials said that they're looking into the case but that Reneau didn't do anything criminally wrong.  Obviously we can’t investigate someone who no longer works here,  the chief said.","Woman Who Drowned Called 911 for Help, Got Scolded","Woman Who Drowned Called ____ for Help, Got Scolded",911,Copy( 911 ),0

Tesla's Model 3, which hits the streets later this month, will cost $35,000—or about half the price of its previous models, the AP reports. The Model 3 is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new Tesla owners at a time when current owners are already complaining about long wait times for repairs. According to Business Insider, a former Tesla employee called the repair process for his Model S a  nightmare,  and other Tesla owners have said it can take weeks to get repairs done. On Tuesday, Tesla announced how it will handle what the Wall Street Journal calls the  most critical test  in its history: The company is hiring 1,400 repair technicians, adding 100 service centers, and deploying 350 new service vans. Currently there are only 150 or so Tesla service centers and 130 repair vans worldwide. Tesla says it can diagnose 90% of maintenance issues remotely and can fix 80% of them without the car being brought to a service center. The new repair vans—equipped with espresso machines and snacks for the customer—will be dispatched to homes and roadsides, ideally freeing up space at service centers.",Espresso-Making Repair Vans Will Service Tesla Model 3,Espresso-Making Repair Vans Will Service Tesla Model ____,3,Copy( 3 ),0

"(Oct 17, 2016  7:03 AM CDT) It's not the Brooklyn Bridge, but authorities in Alabama do have a nuclear power plant they want to sell you. Minimum bids for the never-finished Bellefonte nuke plant start at $36.4 million, which is essentially the value of the 1,400-acre patch of land on the Tennessee River in Hollywood, Ala., with a couple of reactors thrown in, reports the Times Free Press. That's a fraction of the approximately $5 billion that authorities have spent over nearly a half-century to develop the site, once the state's largest energy project. Work began in 1973 on two nuclear reactors—four were planned—when demand for electric power was growing by 5% a year. But as demand ebbed, the project stalled and, faced with a final price tag of $8 billion, the Tennessee Valley Authority decided to quit while it was behind. Support for nuclear power waned after the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island, per the Washington Post.  Selling the property now is a smart business decision,  says the TVA. The auction is set for Nov. 14, and bidding has begun; Phoenix Energy in Nevada has already offered $38 million. Hollywood Mayor Frank  Buster  Duke, who worked at the site as a pipe fitter, hopes a buyer will finish the plant—and generate much-needed jobs.  The plant was 90% complete when TVA quit building it, and I know they would have to change and update some things, but I sure hope somebody could operate it to make power,  Duke tells the Times Free Press.

"(Jul 5, 2019  5:53 AM CDT) California hasn't stopped shaking after its strongest earthquake in 20 years. The 6.4 magnitude quake that hit the Mojave Desert Thursday morning was followed by at least 159 aftershocks of magnitude 2.5 and higher, including six higher than magnitude 4, says United States Geological Survey seismologist Robert Graves. He says the number is higher than normal, but not unprecedented, CNN reports. California Institute of Technology seismologist Lucy Jones says the quake will probably only have a  minimal  effect on the San Andreas Fault, but the region should still expect more aftershocks and possibly a larger quake, reports the Los Angeles Times.  There is about a 1 in 20 chance that this location will be having an even bigger earthquake in the next few days, that we have not yet seen the biggest earthquake of the sequence,  she says. The quake, which was felt as far away as Las Vegas and Phoenix, hit near the town of Ridgecrest, around 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Kern County Fire Chief David Witt says the quake caused multiple injuries and at least two house fires as well as gas leaks and cracked roads in the town of 28,000, the AP reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency for the county. The quake was the strongest in the region since a 7.1 quake on October 16, 1999. Jones says there was an  extremely quiet abnormal time  for 20 years.  The long term average is probably once every five or 10 years somewhere in southern California,  she says.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office rejected filing a misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 because the statute of limitations had passed. Days before Huth spoke to police, she accused Cosby in a civil lawsuit of forcing her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 years old. Cosby's attorney said that Huth attempted to extort $250,000 from the comedian before she sued and that she'd attempted to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago.

Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say.  The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did,  a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would  without a doubt  have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system.

In an interview with CBS News last week, Musk mentioned the couch in his office at Tesla is, well,  not a good couch.   Last time I was here I actually slept, literally, on the floor because the couch is too narrow. It's terrible,  he said.  As a community, we cannot let this stand,  California's Ben Sullins responded Monday with a GoFundMe campaign seeking to buy Musk a couch comfy enough for dozing. More than $5,000, well above the $1,000 goal, has already been raised by 390 people as of this writing. If billionaire Musk is uninterested, Sullins says the funds will be donated to charity, per the Telegraph. If he's open to receiving the new couch, Sullins says he'll  fly up there to hand deliver and film the experience.

Gudrun Burwitz, the oldest child of Heinrich Himmler, was famous in her own right, however. When she was a child, Himmler frequently brought her to public events  as a blond, blue-eyed symbol of Aryan youth,  in the words of the Washington Post. In her later years, she was believed to have been a member of the group Stille Hilfe (Silent Help), which provides assistance to former SS members and their families. Gudrun, who was detained temporarily after the war and testified at the Nuremberg trials, never denounced her father or the Nazi regime, reports the BBC. With her death, the German newspaper Bild has uncovered a nugget that has caused a stir in Germany: For about two years in the 1960s, Gurdrun worked for what was then West Germany's spy agency.  The BND confirms that Ms Burwitz was a member of the BND for a few years until 1963 under an assumed name,  says an official with the agency. She worked there while the agency was run by a former Nazi military intelligence commander. The BND still exists as the unified Germany's foreign intelligence agency, and Deutsche Welle notes that its use of former Nazis in Eastern Europe after the war remains controversial. One item in wide circulation in Gudrun's obituaries is a diary entry she wrote at the age of 12 after her father took her to the notorious Dachau concentration camp.

We should promote healthy sexual exploration. Instead,  campaigns to protect girls from 'sexualization' assume that sexuality itself is a corrupting influence on young women.

Officials near Rochester, Minn., say a van that left a diamond and jewelry trade show in Chicago on Sunday drove 350 miles over six hours before stopping at a rest stop in Minnesota shortly after midnight yesterday. A diamond dealer and four others got out of the van to use the facilities while two people waited in the van with the valuables. Another van then pulled up, and in 90 seconds four people jumped out, smashed windows, grabbed three or four suitcases filled with gold, silver, and loose diamonds, and sped off, reports the Rochester Post-Bulletin.  They were waiting for a dark, remote location, and they found one at the rest stop,  a sheriff's rep tells the AP.  We're dealing with some heavy hitters.  The driver of the diamond dealer's van did reportedly manage to throw the vehicle in reverse and hit the side of the suspects' van, but it sped away on I-90 and the suspects, described as wearing black hoodies, ditched the van just a mile away.

WKRG reports close to 100 sharks were found, though the Alabama Marine Resources Division puts the number at 57, per AL.com. One tourist says about 40 sharks were entangled in a single net.

A county prosecutor said Wednesday the search will remain focused on the 90-acre property owned by a family in the construction and concrete businesses, whose 20-year-old son was briefly held on $1 million bail on an old gun charge.  We're going to continue digging and searching that property until we're satisfied that they are not there,  Bucks County DA Matthew Weintraub said at a morning news conference.

Nearly 30 years after she sliced off his penis while he slept, Bobbitt had two toes amputated on his right foot amid a gruesome series of health woes. Bobbitt tells TMZ his right foot's big toe was amputated in 2019 after a callous grew and the bone became infected. Then, last weekend, the neighboring toe was amputated at a Las Vegas hospital; it became fractured because the lack of a big toe made him exert too much pressure on biggie's neighbor, making it shift and break. Adding to all this, his left foot was in a cast after he stepped on a nail during a 2013 construction job. He told TMZ in October the foot had become infected with osteomyelitis, which is treatable but often requires surgery to remove dead bone. At the time doctors told Bobbitt the foot might have to be amputated. Now he's out of the hospital with a bandaged right foot, special shoes for walking, and a knee scooter to travel from A to B.

It is reasonable to infer that when the knife was picked up that it would be used in the course of a robbery.  Judge Carol Goldstein then denied a request to release the boy, calling him a  threat to public safety.  Charged with second-degree felony murder and robbery, he is to be detained at least until a Jan. 2 hearing. Police are still searching for a 14-year-old who fled before police questioning on Monday.

"(Mar 10, 2015  8:09 AM CDT) What may have been easier: to somewhat vaguely just state that Ryan Bossie died on Jan. 30. Maybe toss in the word  suddenly  or  unexpectedly.  But what the family of the man from Caribou, Maine, chose to do instead was much bolder, and more difficult. They opened his obit with this line:  Ryan Douglas Bossie, 27, died January 30, 2015, in Portland after losing a hard-fought battle with addiction.  Bossie's brother, Andrew, now talks to the Bangor Daily News about the decision to do so, explaining that the first pass at the obituary didn't name Bossie's struggle with drugs.  I just said I don't think we should be ashamed of this,  recounts Andrew.  I hope that by including that maybe it helps someone else just a little bit, that their story has a different ending.  And so the family agreed to take what the paper calls  the rare step  of mentioning the addiction; it's believed Bossie OD'd on heroin. His struggle with drugs included six prior overdoses. A GoFundMe page set up to cover Bossie's funeral expenses noted the investment the family made in trying to get help for Bossie, there described as someone who  purposely confronted life, always trying to please the people he loved while balancing personal demons.  Bossie died a day after a 26-year-old Ohio man whose obituary was even more explicit about his heroin overdose.  All of the wonderful blessings that he had: talent, friendships, positive outlook on life, and, most importantly, family were sidelined by a wrong decision to do drugs,  wrote Alex Hesse's family. They similarly expressed a hope that Hesse's story might  help one person not make the same mistakes that Alex did, save one family from losing a loved one far too young.

"(Oct 23, 2019  1:33 AM CDT) A special code allowed former JetBlue gate agent Tiffany Jenkins to swap cheap plane tickets for expensive ones—and prosecutors say she did this for family and friends more than 500 times before she got caught. Jenkins, who was arrested in November last year, allegedly upgraded 505 tickets for more than 100 people she knew between July 2016 and September 2017, costing the airline around $785,000, the Boston Globe reports. The 31-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud in a federal court in Boston on Friday and will face up to 20 years in prison, as well as a fine of up to twice the airline's loss, when she is sentenced in January, reports the Washington Post.  As a gate agent, Jenkins had access to the airline's computer reservation database and had the ability to use a special code, referred to as an involuntary exchange or 'INVOL' to change flights for customers at no additional cost,  US Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a statement.  This code enables agents to change flights for customers who miss their flights or experience a death in the family.  People reports that many of the tickets Jenkins upgraded started out as $45 domestic flights from Las Vegas to Long Beach, Calif.

"(Jan 19, 2016  6:20 PM) The Islamic State has finally confirmed the death of the man known as Jihadi John, something tentatively announced by US officials following an airstrike back in November, CNN reports. The confirmation comes via an obituary published by ISIS' Dabiq magazine. The obituary provides details about Jihadi John—real name Mohammed Emwazi—as well as a photo of him without his trademark balaclava. Among the claims the article makes about Emwazi is that he  pretended to be unintelligent to trick MI5 officers,  according to the Telegraph. The article states he pretended to be dumb when stopped by authorities while attempting to travel from Britain to Kuwait. Later it claims he was able to travel to Syria to join ISIS  right under the nose of the much-overrated MI5 British intelligence agency.  Emwazi first came to international attention in August 2014 in an ISIS execution video, the BBC reports. He would go on to appear in multiple execution videos and was given the nickname Jihadi John. Emwazi moved to Britain at age 6, became a citizen, and would go on to get a degree in computer programming. According to the Telegraph, the Dabiq article appears to praise him for his part in the beheading videos.  His harshness towards the kafir (non-believers) was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kafir, the entire world bearing witness to this,  the article states. It also praises him for his  mercy, kindness, and generosity towards the believers,  exemplified by the time he gave a concubine to another man as a gift.",ISIS Says Jihadi John Faked Being Dumb to Trick MI5,ISIS Says Jihadi John Faked Being Dumb to Trick MI____,5,Copy( 5 ),0

It was the latest series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake, which was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 58. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured. There was debate over the magnitude of the earthquake.

His mother, Tonya Slaton, has been charged with murdering her son sometime between July 24, 2004, and July 24, 2005. The medical examiner's office has not determined how he died, the Virginian-Pilot reports, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the office says the cause is  inconsistent with natural death.  Slaton, now 44, was convicted of assaulting her son in 1997, when he was 6, but did not serve any time in jail. She was also charged with domestic assault and battery in 2002, but it's not clear whether she was convicted or who the alleged victim was. Davis' friends stopped seeing him after seventh grade. He would have entered eighth grade in September 2003, but he was withdrawn from school in Virginia Beach at that time. He was last seen in  about  2004, per WTVR, but was never reported missing. In 2008, his mother was convicted of shooting at her boyfriend, and she did go to prison after that incident, when her son would have been 17.

"(Nov 11, 2014  9:51 AM) In a mass sterilization of 83 women in India on Saturday, a surgeon used infected instruments; now, 10 patients are dead and 69 others have been hospitalized, a local health official tells Bloomberg.  It's a case of negligence,  says the chief minister of Chhattisgarh state, where surgeons are banned from conducting more than 30 such procedures daily. A reproductive rights activist in New Delhi uses starker terms:  Chhattisgarh was a culmination of no accountability in the system and when basic hygiene conditions aren't met,  she says, adding that such circumstances are  commonplace.  The doctor involved, RK Gupta, has been suspended amid a criminal investigation, says the state's chief minister. The district's top health officer says the deaths were a result of  infection causing septic shock  and that it's  too early to say that it was due to sterilization.  All the women were poor villagers younger than 32, the AP reports. They were paid about $10 each to join the sterilization program, the state's chief medical officer says. The surgeries took place within a six-hour period. As the country works toward population control, sterilizations are voluntary. But amid events like single-day sterilization drives, India has the third-highest female sterilization rate in the world—and while 37% of married women have undergone the process, just 1% of men have had vasectomies, a national survey shows.

In addition to working at Boeing and creating Apollo space flight animations for CBS News, McQuarrie designed the concept art that George Lucas used to sell Star Wars to 20th Century Fox.

On Tuesday, she lost her boyfriend and two children in much the same way. Officers responding to a 911 call found 16-year-old Sterling Jette Jr. inside the Watertown home and 15-year-old Della Jette on a back deck, both with gunshot wounds to the chest. They died shortly after arriving at a hospital, while the alleged shooter—Jette's boyfriend of two years, Paul Ferguson—died at the scene of what is believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reports ABC News. Ferguson, 42, had been living with the family for two weeks when an argument erupted over his habit of smoking indoors. Danielle Jette told police Ferguson grabbed a Glock handgun stored in a bedroom, then shot Sterling in the leg when he tried to intervene.  The mother went downstairs to call 911 when she heard a second gunshot presumably when he shot the daughter on the deck,  says Watertown Police Chief John Gavallas.  He came back into the house and shot the son in the chest  before barricading himself in a bedroom.

They found the air horn guy!  one local crowed online, per the Los Angeles Times, applauding a somewhat anticlimactic ending to the early-morning din that's been plaguing the city for six weeks. On its Facebook page, the El Segundo Police Department noted that at around 4am Sunday, officers heard an  extremely loud air-horn being actuated  and followed the sound to a 2006 Chevy Aveo driving around, which they pulled over. Inside: driver John Nuggent and air horn equipment, which Nuggent admitted to using to stir residents out of sleep. Several locals emerged from their homes and made a citizen's arrest against Nuggent—an important fact, the San Diego Union-Tribune notes, with police explaining that officers can't be victims of  disturbing the peace.  Had the residents not come out, the cops would only have been able to give Nuggent a slap on the wrist for a traffic infraction; now the charge gets prosecutable misdemeanor status, with a maximum of 90 days in jail, a $400 fine, or both if he's found guilty. Sgt. Vincent Martinez tells the Times the blare fest was apparently Nuggent's way of retaliating against someone in the area with whom he had a beef.  I've been an officer for over 27 years and I don't know if I've ever seen someone retaliate using an air horn,  Martinez says.  But people find very creative ways at getting at other people.

According to KABC, Lee Baca, who served as sheriff for 15 years, was found guilty of obstructing justice for his role in a scheme to hamper an FBI investigation into alleged abuses at Los Angeles County jails. Guards were accused of beating inmates, and during an FBI investigation in 2011, deputies under Baca moved the FBI's prison informant to keep him from agents, told the informant and other deputies not to cooperate with the FBI, and threatened to arrest the lead FBI agent in an effort to intimidate her, the Los Angeles Times reports. The three-year sentence for Baca, who's 74 years old and suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's, is one more than prosecutors requested and a far cry from an attempted plea deal of fewer than six months. Judge Percy Anderson was critical of Baca for not taking responsibility for his role in the obstruction plot, saying he would have sentenced Baca to five years in prison if not for his Alzheimer's.  Your actions embarrass the thousands of men and women who put their lives on the line every day,  Anderson told Baca during sentencing. After sentencing, Baca said it  was an honor  to serve Los Angeles County for more than 48 years. It's unclear where Baca will serve his sentence, which starts in July.

He was 74. The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Sunday said Hooper died Saturday in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. It was reported as a natural death. Along with contemporaries like George Romero and John Carpenter, Hooper crafted some of the scariest nightmares that ever haunted moviegoers, the AP reports. Hooper directed 1982's Poltergeist from a script by Steven Spielberg, and helmed the well-regarded 1979 miniseries Salem's Lot, from Stephen King's novel. Hooper was a little-known filmmaker of documentaries and TV commercials when he made his most famous work: 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He made it for less than $300,000 in his native Texas, and yet it became one the most influential films in horror: a slasher film landmark.  I had never seen anything like it and I wanted to see it myself,  said Hooper in 2014. The film was controversial. Several countries banned it, though the independent film — aided by its gory reputation and lightning fast word-of-mouth — grossed $30.8 million, playing for eight years in drive-ins and theaters. Halloween director John Carpenter on Sunday called it  a seminal work in horror cinema,  while William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, recalled Hooper as  a kind, warm-hearted man who made the most terrifying film ever.

They sat at the airport (well preserved) from around Christmastime until the Cook County medical examiner's office took custody this week. After the story went public, a local crematory came forward with the proper paperwork, and the heads will soon be on their way.

Aleh Kalman, 19, was swimming in the Merced River 150 feet upstream from Nevada Fall on Saturday afternoon when he was caught by the current and swept over the edge of the 594-foot waterfall, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The Sacramento teenager was visiting the park with a church group. Authorities say the river was running a  very swift and powerful spring flow of water  when he was swept over and they believe it would have been impossible to survive the fall, CNN reports. Two brothers, ages 6 and 10, died after being swept away in the same river last year, and the year before, three members of a church group died after being swept over another Merced River waterfall.

"(Aug 7, 2011  5:34 AM CDT) About 45,000 Verizon workers from the landline side of the telecom's mid-Atlantic and northeast regions went on strike today, the first such walkout in 11 years, reports the Wall Street Journal. Verizon is seeking concessions from its two major unions in the face of declining landline revenues, thanks to the rise of cell phones and growing competition from cable companies. But even though landline revenue fell 1.2% to $20.4 billion in the first six months of 2011, the company as a whole made $3 billion in profits. Given those profits, the unions contend that the company is just trying to reduce their power.  Verizon has refused to move from a long list of concession demands,  said a union spokesman in a statement earlier today.  As the contract expired, nearly 100 concessionary company proposals remained on the table.  The Communications Workers of America, the larger of the two unions on strike, says it has more than $400 million in contingency funds for the strike. Verizon says the strikes will not affect service, although some managers will be asked to work 72-hour weeks.",45K Verizon Workers Strike,____K Verizon Workers Strike,45,"Paraphrase( 45,000 , K )",1
"(May 7, 2014  9:54 AM CDT) Federal agents are serving hundreds of warrants in dozens of cities as part of a continued crackdown on synthetic drug manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Agents served search and arrest warrants on homes, warehouses, and smoke shops in at least 25 states this morning, a DEA spokesman said. The largest single operation is a state-wide effort in Alabama. Agents also are serving warrants in Florida and New Mexico, among other states. The crackdown involves 33 DEA cases, and seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations. The DEA has been cracking down on synthetic drugs, including so-called bath salts, spice, and Molly, since the drugs first gained widespread popularity years ago. In late 2010, the agency responsible for enforcing federal drug laws moved to ban five chemicals used to make synthetic marijuana blends, including K2, Spice, and Blaze. An interesting aside involves the money trail: Investigators have tracked hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds being sent to Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, says a rep for the DEA Special Operations Division.

"(Nov 21, 2017  4:11 AM) The latest allegation of sleazy behavior on Capitol Hill involves Rep. John Conyers, the longest-serving member of the House. According to BuzzFeed, the Michigan Democrat's office paid $27,000 in 2015 to settle a sexual misconduct complaint from a woman who said she was fired for rejecting his advances. Documents related to the case seen by BuzzFeed include affidavits from staff members describing how Conyers would repeatedly make advances on female staffers. One staffer alleges that Conyers used taxpayer money to transport women he was having affairs with. BuzzFeed says the documents were provided by pro-President Trump activist Mike Cernovich, but it has independently verified them. In the documents, the woman says Conyers regularly asked her for sexual favors and strongly suggested they could  lead to salary increases or promotions.  She tells BuzzFeed that after the complaint, she had to deal with the complex, secretive, and intimidating process of reporting sexual harassment in Congress, which involves going through the Office of Compliance. She says she felt pressured into accepting the settlement in exchange for a confidentiality agreement. Conyers, 88, is the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. His office didn't return calls from the AP and other outlets seeking comment Monday. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she was unaware of the Conyers case, but she supports reforming the current process of reporting sexual misconduct, in which both parties sign nondisclosure agreements.",Report: Rep Paid $27K to Keep Sex Misconduct Claim Quiet,Report: Rep Paid $____K to Keep Sex Misconduct Claim Quiet,27,"Paraphrase( 27,000 , K )",1

The settlement to be paid to Valerie Castile will avoid a federal wrongful death lawsuit stemming from Castile's death, per the AP. The 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was killed by St. Anthony officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop July 6 after Castile told the officer he was armed. Castile had a permit for his gun. The shooting gained widespread attention after Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with her then-4-year-old daughter, livestreamed the gruesome aftermath on Facebook. Yanez, who is Latino, was acquitted of manslaughter and other charges earlier this month. The jury's decision prompted days of protests, including one in St. Paul that shut down Interstate 94 for hours and ended with 18 arrests. The $2.995 million settlement will be paid by the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust, which holds the insurance policy for the city of St. Anthony. It requires approval by a state court, which could take several weeks.

"(Apr 9, 2019  4:45 PM CDT) An Oregon woman had three organs removed over the course of her life. But before her death at age 99, only one doctor had noted anything unusual about her insides. That changed in a big way when Rose Marie Bentley's body arrived at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. Bentley, who the BBC reports died in 2017, had donated her body to science, and a gross anatomy class initially realized something was atypical when they struggled to find a major blood vessel. USA Today reports it was only later in the 2018 spring semester the class realized a number of her organs were transposed. Bentley had a rare condition called situs inversus with levocardia. Per a press release from the university, it occurs in just one in every 22,000 births and is generally associated with an earlier mortality. There are records of just two people living into their 70s with the condition, and assistant professor of anatomy Cameron Walker believes Bentley may have lived longer than anyone else with the condition. While her heart was in the correct place, her liver, stomach, and other abdominal organs were on her left as well. Her appendix, which was one of the organs she'd had removed, wasn't where it typically should be, something the surgeon noted at the time.

Prosecutors had sought 15, reports Reuters. Judge John Hlophe had harsh words for the 51-year-old, who has not been named so as not to reveal the identity she gave to Zephany:  One would have expected you to apologize but you chose not to. It's also very clear you have caused much harm to Zephany. You have actually betrayed her‚  Times Live quotes him as saying. The BBC reports Hlophe also cited the birthday celebrations the Nurses held each year for their absent daughter, which were covered by the press and meant it was clear the family was still looking for her. She had  all the time in the world  to return Zephany, he said, but she obviously did not, the BBC reports. The woman maintained a lady named Sylvia  handed a baby  to her on April 30, 1997, at a train station as part of a prearranged adoption; Hlophe said the  court rejects [that story] with the contempt it deserves,  reports the BBC. After South African schoolkids noticed a physical resemblance between two girls, a DNA test in 2015 revealed that one of them was Zephany and the other her younger sister. The unnamed woman, who lived just a few miles from Celeste and Morne Nurse, was arrested.

"(Nov 22, 2018  9:30 AM) Forensic experts in Sri Lanka have been handed the awful task of tracing more than 230 bodies in the country's largest known mass grave. Uncovered in Mannar in March by workers digging a foundation for a building, the grave had produced 90 skeletons by August, though that number has since grown to 232, per ColomboPage. To be sent to Florida to undergo radiocarbon dating and other tests, the remains found at  a former co-operative depot near the main bus terminus  are believed to belong to victims of a 26-year civil war during which at least 100,000 people were killed, reports the BBC. Showcasing photos of several missing people, the Guardian reports another 65,000 disappeared between 1983 and 2009, when fighting ended between Sri Lankan security forces and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. Locals say hundreds of people disappeared from Mannar specifically. The town dominated by ethnic minority Tamils was under government control for most of the war, with rebels occupying its surrounding areas, per the BBC, which adds that the remains of nearly 100 people were found in another mass grave in Mannar in 2014. It's still unclear who was placed there and by whom; the army denies solders were involved. With partial funding from the Office on Missing Persons, an independent body set up by the government this year, forensic experts now hope to unravel a second mystery hidden within the latest  chaotic  grave. It's  very difficult to trace the stature of the bodies  as bones are scattered or missing, lead archaeologist Raj Somadeva tells the BBC, noting porcelain, ceramic, metal objects, and jewelry were also found.

As BuzzFeed reports,  they were part of a lopsided aid deal between the countries that would ultimately see Russia delivering a little more than $1 million worth of supplies to the US in April, followed by the US sending about $5.6 million to Russia over the following two months.  But the Aventa-M ventilators ended up in the trash. Not only were the models made by a subsidiary of Rostec, a Russian state-owned company under US sanctions, but they weren't of the correct electrical voltage for US hospitals and were suspected of causing fires that killed six people in Russian hospitals, as Reuters reported at the time. After Trump touted the  very nice  delivery, the ventilators ended up sitting unused in storage facilities in New York and New Jersey, per BuzzFeed. By then, Russia's health care regulator had suspended their use after the fires, reports the Moscow Times. It reauthorized the Aventa-M units in July, deciding they hadn't caused the fires, but FEMA didn't use its stock. The agency tells BuzzFeed that the 45 units were  disposed of following strict hazardous waste disposal regulatory guidelines.  This has further rankled Democrats upset over the unbalanced arrangement that saw the US deliver 200 ventilators to Russia in June, per BuzzFeed.

Glyphosate, developed by Monsanto in the 1970s, has recently been on the radar since the World Health Organization announced last year that it  probably  causes cancer, while the Food and Drug Administration announced earlier this year that it will begin testing some foods for it. Eater reports that it's been found in more than a dozen popular German beers.  Quaker does not add glyphosate during any part of the milling process,  parent company PepsiCo said in a statement to Fortune, which notes that several brands, including Honest Co. and Welch's Fruit Snacks, have recently faced similar litigation.  Glyphosate is commonly used by farmers across the industry who apply it pre-harvest.  But the lawsuit specifically calls out false advertising, not growing problems.  There is nothing unlawful about Quaker Oats' growing and processing methods,  it reads.  What is unlawful is Quaker's claim that Quaker Oats is something that it is not in order to capitalize on growing consumer demand for healthful, natural products.

Brooks' 71-year-old former neighbor, Philip Wilson, was arrested at his Sacramento home on Thursday and charged with murder with the special circumstance allegation of rape. Accused of raping and stabbing 20-year-old Brooks in her Sacramento apartment in 1980, Wilson—described as 6'4  and 300 pounds—had  never come up in the investigation  until he was identified via familial DNA, cold case investigator Michaela Links tells People. Police had approached ancestry-tracing companies after blood at the scene—the result of an apparent cut—failed to match DNA entries in a database of arrested people, per KXTV. Brooks, a native of New York state, had only been living at the apartment for just over a month before she was murdered. On the night she was last seen alive, she left her job at a doughnut shop around the corner from the apartment complex and briefly attended a party before heading home. She was found stabbed to death in her bedroom the next day, April 24, when she failed to show up for work. Links believes Brooks was stalked before she was killed. She'd reportedly told friends that  there was somebody bothering her in her place of business,  Arrick tells KXTV. Arrick adds she's  thrilled  with the arrest, per People.  What's a miracle is that DNA. It gives a lot of hope for other people,  she says.  I never gave up.  Wilson was arraigned in Sacramento Superior Court, where he appeared in a wheelchair. He's next due in court on May 5.",Neighbor Arrested 40 Years After Calif. Woman's Murder,Neighbor Arrested ____ Years After Calif. Woman's Murder,40,Copy( 40 ),0
"(Nov 6, 2015  8:16 AM) George Barris, the legendary custom car builder who created television's original Batmobile and helped define California's car culture with colorfully designed vehicles ranging from the stunningly beautiful to the simply outrageous, died Thursday. He was 89. Barris, who had been in declining health, died at his Los Angeles home with his family by his side, says Edward Lozzi, his longtime publicist and friend. Barris customized cars and buses for TV shows, movies, celebrities, and heads of state and was a pioneer in designing small, plastic models of those customized cars. The models popularized his wildly imaginative vehicles all the more when they were assembled by millions of American youngsters in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.  He was the man who started the American pastime for baby boomers,  Lozzi says. Born in Chicago in 1925, Barris and his brother customized their first car—a 1925 Buick—as teenagers. They sold it and used the money to work on another. After fully customizing a 1936 Ford in high school, Barris formed the Kustoms Car Club. The unusual spelling of  custom,  never fully explained, came to be his signature. The brothers, meanwhile, moved to Southern California after World War II and began designing cars for private buyers. Their clients came to include Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Burt Reynolds, and Sylvester Stallone. After Sam Barris left the business in the 1950s, George and his wife, Shirley, continued on their own. His most famous creations, such as the Ala Kart and the Hirohata Merc, remain instantly recognizable on the car collector circuit to this day. The most famous of all, the Batmobile, built from a refurbished 1955 Lincoln Futura, sold at auction two years ago for $4.2 million.",Legendary Batmobile Creator Dead at 89,Legendary Batmobile Creator Dead at ____,89,Copy( 89 ),0

The station doesn't go into the minutiae of the paper, but it worked: Krioukov got out of his $400 ticket.

Show him the same amount of mercy he showed Eric and Cooper, and we all know how much that was—none,  Dawn Miller, mother of Eric Cooper and grandmother to 2-year-old Cooper Chen, told the court. Chen, who said the cough medicine caused depression, paranoia, and a psychotic break, received the maximum sentence allowed in the state of Washington, reports the Seattle Times.  We believe it is a reasonable sentence for the taking of two lives in the most horrific way possible,  the senior deputy prosecutor says. Chen, an immigrant from Taiwan, met Cooper 12 years earlier, when he was in his late 20s and Cooper was a 17-year-old senior in high school. They had their son using Chen's sperm, a Taiwanese woman's egg, and a surrogate friend. They'd just moved to Seattle from North Carolina after Chen accepted a job at Virginia Mason Medical Center. When Chen failed to show up on his first day of work on Aug. 11, a hospital manager found him in his penthouse, naked and covered in dried blood;  I did,  he responded when asked who committed the murders. Despite his admission, the prosecutor decided not to seek the death penalty, reports Q13 Fox. Prosecutors argued it was not psychosis that drove Chen, but rage and fear over a pending breakup and custody battle.

"(Feb 4, 2015  9:13 AM) A new study finds that, despite your intentions, you may simply be inclined to cheat or not to cheat. As Phys.org reports, humans appear to be the rare mammals that can be either monogamous or polygamous—other species are typically one or the other. And now, University of Oxford researchers say they've found that some humans (53% of women and 43% of men) are more inclined to be faithful, while others (57% of men and 47% of women) are more inclined to be promiscuous.  This research suggests that there may be two distinct types of individuals within each sex, pursuing different mating strategies,  the researchers say of their results, published in Biology Letters. To get these results, the team compared the results from a questionnaire of sexual habits to data on something called the  2D:4D  ratio. That ratio has to do with finger length: The longer your ring finger is when compared to your index finger, the higher the levels of testosterone you were likely exposed to in the womb; these higher levels have been linked to a higher chance of promiscuity.  While not predictive of individual behavior, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous,  a University of Oxford press release explains. The researchers compared those results to the questionnaire data because, one explains,  human behavior is influenced by many factors, such as the environment and life experience, and what happens in the womb might only have a modest effect on something as complex as sexual relationships.  (Meanwhile, jealous men and women focus on very different things.)",57% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,____% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,57,Copy( 57 ),0

But the good times apparently have an expiration date. The men found that their happiness began to diminish around age 70, which NPR dubs  the approximate moment when grumpiness kicks in for men.  The study, published in March's Psychology and Aging, shed some light on why the men, who were between the ages of 53 and 85 during the 15-year study, found that life improved at first, then started to be a downer around 70.  Older adults,  referring to those around 50,  on average have fewer hassles—and respond to them better—than younger adults,  explains lead author Carolyn Aldwin. But as decades pass new  hassles  set in, and how the men  appraised  them changed. Per a press release, appraisals of hassles improved during one's 60s, then downgraded in one's 70s (Aldwin points out that later-in-life hassles include health issues, the death of family and friends, and mental decline). But she adds that old men aren't doomed to gloom, as there are new sources of happiness:  You may lose a parent, but gain a grandchild.

The breakneck speed at which journalists have been naming the next perpetrator renders some reporting irresponsible,  they said.

We understand and appreciate the difficult experience,  airline president and CEO Kurt Kamrad said in a letter to passengers, per the Florida Times-Union. There were no deaths or serious injuries reported after the Boeing 737 from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba slid off the end of the runway after landing during a thunderstorm, though 21 passengers were hospitalized with minor injuries and at least three pets died in the hold. Passengers left their belongings behind as they evacuated the plane via the wings.

"(Mar 8, 2016  12:22 PM) Although laws in Virginia state the minimum age to wed is 16, the fine print reveals a more disturbing picture: Much younger kids may be able to marry with parental permission and if the girl is pregnant, leading to extreme cases in which youngsters not even in their teens have been granted marriage licenses, per the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Republican Sen. Jill Vogel, who says current laws  are not protecting children,  hopes to put an end to that loophole with state Senate Bill 415 and companion House Bill 703, which call for raising the minimum age for all marriages to 16, WTOP reports. If approved by the governor (both bills flew through their respective chambers Monday), the new law would permit marriage for 16- and 17-year-olds only if they petition a judge, who would consider their ages, maturity, and criminal history and determine they weren't being threatened or forced to marry.  It's rarely the case that [a pregnant] 13-year-old is marrying a 17-year-old,  Vogel says.  It's more often ... that it is a child marrying somebody decades older than they are.  In cases like that, Vogel says, instead of issuing a marriage license,  someone … should be asking the question, 'Well, if this 13-year-old is pregnant, isn't that evidence of statutory rape?'  Vogel also notes the gender disparity in the state's current laws, noting a pregnant 13-year-old girl could be forced to marry, but a boy that age doesn't face that dilemma. State Sen. Thomas Garrett doesn't concur with the bill, arguing that it replaces the  insight and judgment of parents with that of the court,  per the Times-Dispatch, but Vogel says it's necessary.  It really shocks the conscience, some of the situations children have found themselves in.

"(Apr 4, 2011  7:52 AM CDT) In an attempt to reframe the budget debate, Republicans are proposing a 2012 budget that features $4 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade—and would end Medicare as we know it, reports the Wall Street Journal. Democrats won’t likely support the 2012 plan, helmed by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan, but Republicans are betting Americans are concerned enough about the deficit that they’ll support vast cuts to a system that pays bills for many, the Journal notes. Under the plan, which would affect those now under 55, Medicare would become a  premium support  system. At 65, participants would select a private insurance plan, and the government would pay about the first $15,000 in premiums, with the poor and less healthy receiving heftier amounts.  There is nobody saying that Medicare can stay in its current path,  Ryan said. As it stands, the program is projected to cost $502.8 billion in 2016.

From 1980 to 2010 (the most recent available year), those earning more than $200,000 have enjoyed the largest decline in total taxes as a percentage of income, and 85% of households earning more than $25,000 per year have also seen the percentage of their income that goes to taxes drop. The group that got hit hardest? Those earning less than $25,000, only about half of which have seen their tax burden decline. While federal tax rates have been cut across the board since 1980, state and local taxes (which typically take a larger percentage of the lowest earners' income) have increased in most of the country, offsetting much of the federal savings—in six states, local tax increases have exceeded the decline in federal rates. Overall, about 31 cents of each dollar earned goes to the government, about the same as in 1980. However, changes to the tax code have seen the taxes paid by a household earning $350,000 fall to 42.1% from 49% (adjusted for inflation). While a household making $22,000 in 2010 paid a much lower percentage—19.4%—that's much closer to what it was for that household in 1980: 20.2%.","If It Was 1980, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes","If It Was ____, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes",1980,Copy( 1980 ),0

"(Jul 31, 2014  2:05 AM CDT) A grad student in Colombia who says he just wanted to help other researchers—and the endangered amphibians they study—could get up to eight years in prison for copyright infringement after sharing a research paper he found online. Diego Gomez, 26, posted the paper on a file-sharing site and is being prosecuted under tough copyright laws introduced as part of Colombia's 2006 free trade agreement with the US, Slate reports. Even though the author was credited and the work was already online, the other academic filed a complaint for  violation of economic rights and related rights,  Gomez says in an open letter explaining his plight.  Today what the vast majority of the country's researchers and conservationists are doing, despite being committed to spreading knowledge, is turning us into criminals,  writes Gomez, who says he was shocked to find that knowledge in  biological sciences, which generally do not obey the market logic, is considered similar to software or an artistic work for commercial exploitation.  The case shows  the real-life harm of overreaching restrictions due to excessive laws that protect the 'economic rights' of authors,  writes Maira Sutton at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Gomez only wanted to share these articles to further his life mission to protect native wildlife and to allow others with a similar passion to access this research.

"(Nov 13, 2013  4:42 PM) The tech world is abuzz today with a Wall Street Journal report that photo-sharing service Snapchat got a $3 billion buyout offer from Facebook—and said thanks, but no thanks. It seems that 23-year-old CEO Evan Spiegel isn't ready to even consider offers at this point given his company's growing number of users. Besides, Facebook may have undershot the mark—another offer reportedly in the work from China's Tencent Holdings values Snapchat at $4 billion, notes the Journal. Snapchat's niche is that it allows users to send photos and messages that soon self-destruct. (Though there's some doubt about that.)  This makes it perfect for sharing naughty photos with loved ones, which isn’t advertised by Snapchat, but can be somewhat attributed to its popularity,  writes Tom Cheredar at Venture Beat.

The strikes early Tuesday destroyed a command post and training camp, a military spokesman says. France conducted sweeping raids Sunday night on Raqqa, and the French president is calling for strengthened international coordination against ISIS after attacks killed at least 129 people around Paris on Friday. Addressing lawmakers after France observed a minute of silence honoring the 129 people killed and 350 wounded, Francois Hollande said the victims came from at least 19 nations, and the international community, led by the US and Russia, must overcome their deep-seated divisions over Syria to destroy ISIS on its home turf.  Friday's acts of war were decided and planned in Syria. They were organized in Belgium and perpetrated on our soil with French complicity with one specific goal: to sow fear and to divide us,  Hollande told Parliament in a rare joint session convened at the Palace of Versailles.  Syria has become the biggest factory of terrorism the world has ever known and the international community is still too divided and too incoherent.

A female student at Taipei's Chinese Culture University didn't resort to an angry fridge note after discovering one of her yogurt-drink containers empty in the trash of the home she shares with five other women.

What's more, officers asked all six housemates to report to the local station to provide DNA samples. Per the BBC, each taxpayer-funded test cost roughly $100. In the end, cops got their suspect, who is now facing a charge of theft. Taxpayers, however, doubt whether the effort was worth the result.

It sounds like a no-brainer, but in the US, the average family of four spends between $500 to $2,000 per year on food that gets thrown away, the Wall Street Journal reports. Vegetables are the worst culprit, making up 25% of avoidable waste. In all, 33 million tons of food ended up in US landfills and incinerators in 2010—the biggest solid waste component, once paper and paperboard are removed and recycled. If shoppers don't bring along a thoughtful list to the grocery store, many will overestimate how much they actually need to buy, researchers have found. People also tend to  stockpile  certain items or buy in bulk to save money—but then never finish eating what they bought. But concerns are starting to be raised, thanks to the growing cost of food and the country's continued economic troubles, leading some manufacturers to introduce ways of keeping food fresh (think plastic bags with  fresh vents  for air circulation).

Now the mother of a toddler girl, Thompson is suing Portland Adventist Medical Center in Oregon for $8.6 million, faulting the hospital for negligence and a lack of clear policies, reports KATU. That's because Thompson, who gave birth to a healthy boy on Aug. 2, 2012, was on Ambien and Vicodin when hospital staff brought 4-day-old Jacob to nurse in the hospital bed with her, unsupervised, at 3am. When she woke up groggy an hour later, he was unresponsive.  She called for a nurse while she tried to get him to respond,  her lawsuit, filed last Friday, states.

Suvir Mirchandani, 14, wanted to find a way to make his many school handouts more sustainable. It all boiled down to a single liquid: After all,  ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,  he tells CNN. Suvir collected random teachers' handouts, then picked out the most commonly used letters—e, t, a, o, and r—and used four different fonts to determine which typeface used the least ink. He even weighed the printouts and graphed the ink usage, and with its thinner strokes, Garamond was the clear winner. Suvir found that switching to the font could reduce his school's ink consumption by 24%, saving up to $21,000 per year. But here's the kicker: When Suvir applied his findings to documents from the Government Printing Office—the Government Services Administration spends an estimated $467 million annually on ink—the results were basically the same. If the government switched exclusively to Garamond, it could save almost 30% per year, or $136 million, Suvir notes. Get the states on board, and another $234 million could be kept in pocket.

"(Apr 5, 2014  7:40 AM CDT) Even if you're a proud consumer of five servings of fruits and vegetables daily, you're not getting enough, an extensive British study suggests. And steer clear of the canned stuff. University College London researchers reviewed the diets of 65,000 people; they found that those who ate more fresh fruits and vegetables tended to live longer, and the magic threshold seemed to be seven-plus servings every day. Those who hit that level reduced their risk of death  from all causes  by 42% as compared to those who ate less than one portion daily, the Guardian reports. More specifically, those big on fruits and veggies saw a 31% lower risk of heart disease and a 25% lower risk of cancer. Hitting five is, of course, still beneficial: Eat three to five portions, and overall risk drops 29%, while five to seven means a 36% lower risk, Time reports. In the US, the standard slogan when it comes to fruits and vegetables is  more matters,  but the best advice is Australia's, says a researcher; in that country, the advice is  go for 2+5,  or two servings of fruits and five of vegetables.  From our study it looks like vegetables are better than fruit,  she says. Be warned: Canned and frozen fruit, the study finds, may actually increase heart disease, stroke, and cancer risk, the Guardian notes. Researchers are cautious about that finding, however, suggesting it could be because canned fruit is often smothered in sugary syrup.

That he was a killer was already known: Niels Hoegel, a 41-year-old former nurse, is currently serving a life sentence in connection with the murders and attempted murders of six of his patients. During that trial, he mentioned intentionally using drugs to cause cardiac arrests in scores of patients in order to then revive them; that led authorities to exhume 130 bodies. He's now accused of killing 36 in Oldenburg—where his current trial opened Tuesday—and 64 in Delmenhorst over the years 1999 and 2005. When asked by the judge in Oldenburg if the charges that he murdered 100 people were largely true, Hoegel answered  yes,  per the AP, which reports German defendants don't formally plead their guilt or innocence.  What I have admitted took place,  he said, per the AFP. The AP reports on the implications of this trial and Hoegel's hope for freedom: Sentences in Germany aren't served consecutively, and those serving life are generally up for parole after 15 years. More convictions could impact his chance of parole.  The aim is for Hoegel to stay in custody as long as possible,  says a rep from the patients' families, who added  we ... expect Hoegel to be convicted of another 100 killings.

At most two leopards are behind the attacks, officials say, because man-eating leopards are so rare—and this one is unlikely to stop.

So far the victims are all women and children in villages that border dense forests, but officials suspect the leopard of killing people in India too. The creature's strategy is simple: drag each victim into a forest and eat everything it can. Only the head—and with adult victims parts of the body—are left behind. Now officials are skirting the law against killing wild animals by offering about $300 to anyone who hunts down the animal.

"(Sep 28, 2019  11:30 AM CDT)  What if Planet 9 is a Primordial Black Hole?  That's the title of a new paper about the mysterious gravity source at the edge of our solar system, Business Insider reports. Posted Tuesday on arXiv, the paper suggests that the still-unseen source—which some call Planet Nine, or Planet X—could actually be a small primordial black hole. That apparently fits what scientists see way out there, 20 times further than Neptune, where ice chunks have their own oval-shaped orbit in what's called the Kuiper Belt. Authors Jakub Scholtz and James Unwin, both physics PhDs, urge us to consider the notion of a relatively close black hole.  By simply focusing on the concept of a planet, you restrict the experimental search that you’re undertaking,  Unwin tells Gizmodo.  Once you start thinking about more exotic objects, like primordial black holes, you think in different ways.

Nor did they notice his absence at bedtime, or overnight. Indeed, it was shortly before 8am Tuesday that the mother of the boy finally called police, reports KUTV. It had then been some 12 hours since a woman had discovered the crying boy alone at the Crazy Corn Maze in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan and brought him to the maze owners. Because the boy only revealed his age and the names of his brother and cat, the owners went car to car and throughout the maze, announcing that a lost child had been found, per KSL. The boy was finally turned over to the Department of Child and Family Services when no one claimed him. On Tuesday morning, the boy's mother  woke up and noticed he was missing,  West Jordan police officer Joe Monson tells the Salt Lake Tribune.  She realized she may have left him at the corn maze and called us.  Police issued no citations, but DCFS is investigating why  it took so long for them to realize the child was missing,  Monson tells KUTV. It  sounds like this is a dwelling with multiple families and a lot of children living in the same home,  he says, telling the AP the mother eventually turned up at the police station with 10 kids in tow.

If you're thinking,  the horror!  then you'll be glad to hear that management for the Japanese rail company has formally apologized for the train's 20-seconds-early departure.  The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation,  it said in an official statement and  sincere  apology that led to bemusement on the internet.  I once had an Israeli bus driver laugh at me after he closed the door on my hips and drove off with my legs hanging out of the bus. I am so envious of Japan right now,  one person tweeted. The BBC reports that it's  rare  for trains in Japan to be off-schedule, and another tweet highlights that fact, noting,  Have been on a train in Japan where I heard an apology for the train running one minute late.  The statement notes that there were no official customer complaints lodged about the early departure from a station just north of Tokyo, but apologizes if any customers missed the train by 20 seconds and were forced to wait for the next one—four minutes later, reports Bloomberg. Yahoo News UK notes that Japan's trains are  among the most reliable in the world,  offering a mournful comparison to Britain, where  commuters are only too acquainted with the daily frustration of late trains on the way to work.

The line of severe thunderstorms spawned several possible tornadoes, and the threat continued into early Tuesday for southern Alabama, southwest Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle, the AP reports. Four people were killed Monday evening when a tree fell on their mobile home in Rehobeth, Ala., according to a spokeswoman for the Dothan Houston County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for Houston County in the southern part of the state Monday evening. In Georgia, some of the heaviest rains were expected late Monday night and into the overnight hours of early Tuesday, forecasters said. State emergency officials reported no injuries or deaths in Louisiana and Mississippi, but a trip to Walmart was memorable for shoppers in Marksville, La., as severe weather blew out skylights in the store, sending water and glass cascading onto shoppers. Marksville Fire Chief Jerry Bordelon says a fireworks stand in the parking lot was tossed 30 or 40 yards and mangled.

"(Mar 24, 2015  10:40 AM CDT) To see the Earth's ecology forest for its trees, first we have to acknowledge there aren't many large, intact forests around. In fact, according to a new study published in Science Advances, there are only two such continuous forests left: in South America and Africa, Christian Science Monitor reports.  There are really only two big patches of intact forest left on Earth—the Amazon and the Congo—and they shine out like eyes from the center of the map,  study leader Nick Haddad tells the New Yorker. The rest of the wooded areas on Earth are fragmented by everything from roads and man-made developments to natural events such as wildfires, the EPA notes. About 70% of the world's forested areas are situated within a half-mile of the actual forest edge, per the Monitor. The result of so many fragmented habitats is  ruinous,  notes the New Yorker. This study found that broken-up areas on average lose half their plant and animal species within two decades, the Monitor reports.  Once a forest disappears, the resulting area is more exposed and experiences greater extremes of temperature, humidity, and wind,  co-author Douglas Levey tells the Monitor. To make things worse, Levey adds, intruding species find their way into the disrupted habitat as well. All is not doomed, though: Because fragmentation often happens very slowly, it's possible to reconnect forest  clumps  by planting linking trees, Levey says:  It's never too late to preserve what we already have.

By the end of the year, it might count 224,000 more, according to an updated model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, reports the Washington Post. The 410,451 deaths by Jan. 1 are expected under the most likely scenario offered by the model, which assumes current restrictions remain the same. Under a worst-case scenario, in which mask usage stays at current rates but social distancing requirements continue to be relaxed in favor of herd immunity, US deaths could top 620,000, per USA Today and CNN. An additional 100,000 deaths over the next four months, for a total of 288,381, is seen as the best-case scenario, requiring near-universal mask use, per the Hill. The most likely scenario predicts 2.8 million global deaths by the end of the year. Almost 770,000 lives worldwide could be saved with near-universal mask use and the continuation of social distancing measures, according to the model. But 4 million deaths could come under the worst-case scenario. About 910,000 coronavirus-related deaths have now been reported around the world. The Hill notes the IHME model—used by the White House coronavirus team for its early pandemic guidelines—is more aggressive than some other models in its projections. Critics say it makes forecasts too far into the future. Still, IHME Director Christopher Murray warns that  we are facing the prospect of a deadly December  as colder weather forces people indoors.

That's a tad bit better and worse than expectations, per the Wall Street Journal, which were 5.4% and 233,000 jobs. The rate is also a seven-year low, but writing for the Journal, Michael J. Casey brands the news an  anticlimax. Below consensus but bang in the range of steady and stable growth. No big changes to rate outlook to come from this headline at least.  (The AP takes a difference stance:  The numbers show the job market moving close to full health and raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as September.  Before the numbers hit, Paul Vigna, also writing for the Journal, wasn't expecting the report to rattle the rate outlook much. His take:  With two more jobs reports coming before the Fed’s September meeting, the one at which many people now think they will begin hiking rates, the June report could say almost anything. The July and August reports will be fresher and more important in swaying the Fed’s decision on rates, is the thinking.  Among the gloomier details: The percentage of Americans working or looking for work has hit a 38-year low of 62.6%, which Casey sees as a reminder that  there is still a big overhang of unemployable people in the US.

"(Jan 4, 2018  11:40 AM) It's a gradual and cruel fate: an inherited form of vision loss that typically ends in blindness and has had no cure. But for those with mutations in a gene known as RPE65 comes a balm. The FDA in December approved Luxturna, a new gene therapy that can treat the progressive blindness, and on Wednesday, its maker revealed the staggering cost: $425,000 per eye. Pricing it was entering a bit of a brave new world: NBC News reports Luxturna is the first  true gene therapy  that's gotten the green light here for an inherited disease, and unlike other pharmaceutical companies' workhorses—drugs that patients take for weeks, months, or even a lifetime—Luxturna is expensive to create and delivered just once. And as the Washington Post explains, Luxturna isn't necessarily a cure for the up to 2,000 Americans who suffer from the disease. In trials, it has  worked  for patients for as long as four years (FierceBiotech explains patients are born with poor vision, and their vision doesn't become  normal  with Luxturna but does functionally improve), though there are indications its effects could extend beyond that mark. The Guardian reports that maker Spark Therapeutics had previously tossed out the figure $1 million when discussing the total treatment cost, saying that was a fair amount when you consider the cost of blindness. The Post says it went with the lower figure in part because insurers indicated $500,000 per eye would shrink the pool of those who qualified, and the company is discussing rebate and payment plan options. But one critic tells NBC he wants Spark to release its R&D costs so  analysts, payers, and the public have a basis to assess Spark's decision.",Company Says Its Treatment for Blindness Will Cost $850K,Company Says Its Treatment for Blindness Will Cost $____K,850,"Add( Paraphrase( 425,000 , K ) , Paraphrase( 425,000 , K ) )",1

Several hundred people gathered in front of the central post office in downtown Algiers, the capital, on Tuesday night after his announcement. The crowd was peaceful, singing songs and waving Algerian flags while drivers passing by honked horns in celebration. An official in Bouteflika's office told the AP that the leader resigned, a few weeks before the end of his fourth term. The move came after six weeks of mass protests and soon after the army chief urged him to step down immediately. The Constitutional Council is expected to meet Wednesday to confirm the resignation and declare the president of the upper house of parliament as interim leader for 90 days until presidential elections are held. The protests were aimed at pushing Bouteflika and his much-criticized inner circle from power to create a real democracy in the gas-rich nation. Corruption scandals had dogged him and associates, and he had failed to create an economy that could offer enough jobs for Algeria's growing youth population despite the nation's vast oil and gas wealth. In a country where secrecy surrounds the leadership, it has never been clear whether Bouteflika was fully in charge or whether the powerful army was pulling the strings. His resignation was preceded by a series of moves at the top, including a new government announced days ago and, above all, calls by Army chief Gen. Ahmed Gaid Salah for Bouteflika to submit to Article 102 of the Constitution that would declare him unfit for office. Gaid Salah added two more articles called for by protesters, notably Article 7, which stipulates that  the people are the source of power.

It isn't clear if the associates referred to were involved in Trump's business interests in Russia or later became part of his presidential campaign. Officials say it's commonplace for Russian officials to discuss players with major business interests in the country, Trump among them. Indeed, intelligence agencies initially took little from the conversations. But Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton has since renewed interest. President Trump said Wednesday he only became aware of the meeting with the lawyer  a couple of days ago,  per Reuters. Hours after Trump Jr. confirmed the meeting on June 7, 2016, however, Trump promised in a speech to address Clinton's  corrupt dealings  to give  favorable treatment  to  the Russians,  in what the White House is calling a coincidence, reports the New York Times.",US Spies Heard Russians Discussing Trump Aides in 2015,US Spies Heard Russians Discussing Trump Aides in ____,2015,Copy( 2015 ),0

Brad Davis, 34, in May pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in the death of Denver Lee St. Clair; at the time Davis said he killed the 58-year-old  in the heat of passion while defending myself in a fight that got out of hand and went too far.  Police say both men had been drinking on the night of Dec. 21, 2013, and a fight ensued after St. Clair allegedly spoke ill of his estranged wife, Davis' mother. In a hearing early in the case, investigators testified that Davis knocked out his stepfather before the killer wedgie and took photos both before and after. St. Clair was found dead with his underwear pulled over his head, with the elastic band cutting off his air. The Oklahoman reports that the head wounds St. Clair sustained would have killed him, had the wedgie not ended his life first; Reuters reports St. Clair's cause of death is listed as blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Davis, of McLoud, had faced between four and 35 years; the judge handed him the sentence that prosecutors had requested.

Potential candidates including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Deval Patrick have had one-on-one sitdowns with the former president at his Washington office in recent months, though, sources say, the subject of the 2020 race hasn't come up in many of the conversations. Rather, Obama is eager to discuss the Democratic Party's prospects in both the midterms and the 2020 election and how those prospects can be improved in order to push back against President Trump and his policies, and is looking to act as a  sounding board  for those likely to play a large role in the party's future. Obama will, however, offer his opinion on campaigns and campaigning against Trump specifically, and his help getting donors and party VIPs to return calls. Obama has also met with Cory Booker, Eric Garcetti, Eric Holder, and lesser-known potential 2020 candidates including former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttigieg; and former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. Democratic leaders who aren't presidential candidates have been to his office as well, including Harry Reid and multiple senators; Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the DNC chair have spoken to him by phone. Obama has even had conversations with Republicans including John McCain and Trump critic Jeff Flake. Politico notes that donors and others in the party have hoped Obama would take a more public anti-Trump stance, and though he has not done that yet, privately he's urging contributions to the DNC.

Sources tell USA Today that Wahlberg's contract included co-star approval, and he refused to approve Christopher Plummer as a replacement for the disgraced Spacey unless there was a hefty payday involved.  What he said was, 'I will not approve Christopher Plummer unless you pay me,'  one insider says.  And that's how he (expletive) them.  Co-star Michelle Williams did the reshoot for the $80 per diem rate, making less than $1,000.

A source tells the Wrap that Wahlberg was able to demand more than 1,000 times as much as his co-star because his contract included reshoots and Williams' contract didn't.

When his mother asked him to hand over the gun, he said he'd given it away—not realizing the .22 was in his bag, too. Farley alerted the principal, who locked down the school and alerted authorities.

He was released on humanitarian grounds by the Cuban government at the request of the United States, a senior Obama administration official tells the AP. His release comes as part of a  landmark humanitarian prisoner exchange  that Obama will announce today, ABC News reports, as well as an overhaul in US-Cuba relations born from more than a year of  secret back-channel talks at the highest levels of both governments.  Gross may have benefited from the involvement of none other than Pope Francis, who personally appealed to Obama and Castro to restart relations, reports the AP. The two leaders spoke for 45 minutes yesterday in the first such discussion since 1961. Obama is set to speak at noon today, reports CNN. The AP reports the three Cubans that were released as part of the deal are members of the so-called Cuban Five—a group of men who were part of the  Wasp Network  sent by Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro to spy in South Florida. The men, who are hailed as heroes in Cuba, were convicted in 2001 in Miami on charges including conspiracy and failure to register as foreign agents in the US. Two of the Cuban Five were previously released after finishing their sentences. The New York Times adds that the trio weren't technically exchanged for Gross; rather, they were swapped for a US spy imprisoned for nearly 20 years in Cuba.

"(Dec 9, 2016  12:37 AM) Los Angeles prosecutors on Thursday sued four national retailers, accusing them of duping shoppers into believing they got bigger discounts than they actually did, the AP reports. The separate lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising were filed against JC Penney, Sears, Kohl's, and Macy's, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's office.  Customers have the right to be told the truth about the prices they're paying—and to know if a bargain is really a bargain,  Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. Feuer said the retailers falsely advertised higher regular prices for merchandise so customers believed they were getting bigger bargains. California law bars retailers from advertising a higher original price unless the product was sold at that price within three months of the ad. The lawsuits seek civil penalties up to $2,500 for each violation and injunctions to stop so-called false reference pricing to increase sales. Prosecutors said thousands of  sale  items were advertised at false reference prices. One of the lawsuits said JC Penney was selling a maternity bathing suit top online for $31.99 in February, down from a so-called original price of $46. The top was later marked down further but still compared to the $46 price point, even though the item was never actually sold for $46. Prosecutors said JC Penney and Kohl's previously faced class-action lawsuits alleging similar deceptive business practices and had agreed to stop. There was no immediate comment from any of the retailers.",4 National Retailers Sued Over 'Deceptive' Ads,____ National Retailers Sued Over 'Deceptive' Ads,4,Trans( four ),1

For the first time at the Games, gymnastics will be assessed on a scale with no ceiling, with gold medalists expected to receive a mark of 17. The new, supposedly fairer system has divided the sport, reports the New York Times. Gymnasts will be scrutinized by two sets of judges, one judging difficulty, the other artistry. Paul Hamm, whose gold medal in Athens was in doubt during two months of arbitration, praised the new system, which  separates the good gymnasts from the really, really good gymnasts.

In the 12-plus years since, the 40-year-old Indian known as the  Iron Lady  has been on a hunger strike to protest India's Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which gives the military wide-ranging rights in restive regions and which human rights groups say has been used to torture and kill suspected rebels with impunity. She was arrested three days after that last meal and has been force-fed twice daily via a nose tube ever since—and yesterday, she was charged with attempted suicide, the AP reports. Since her arrest, the government has been releasing her once every year, then taking her back into custody when she continues to refuse to eat—the Belfast Telegraph notes that she won't even use water to brush her teeth.

Tiger Woods took the lead on Sunday at a major for the first time in nine years and lost it with one bad swing. Jordan Spieth cost himself another chance in a major by failing to make a single birdie. Seven players had a share of the lead at some point. Six were still tied on the back nine. Through all that suspense, Molinari never flinched. He closed with a 2-under 69, playing the final 37 holes on the toughest links in golf without a bogey. The clincher was a bold drive on the 18th hole that flirted with edge of a pot bunker, a wedge to 5 feet and a birdie putt that made him a major champion. Molinari, who finished at 8-under 276, raised his fist and shook it lightly before slamming it for emphasis. The first to congratulate him was Woods. Woods was at 7 under, in control of his game and hitting shots that only he can. From a pot bunker on No. 10, he took a bold and vicious swing to get it over the lip, over the burn and to the front edge of the green. And then it all went wrong. He pulled his shot from the rough on No. 11 into the gallery, fluffed a wedge short of the green, ran it by 8 feet and missed the putt for double bogey. Another poor swing followed and led to another bogey, and just like that, Woods was two shots behind and reeling.  A little ticked off at myself, for sure,  Woods said.

"(Mar 27, 2018  8:37 AM CDT) An archaeologist a continent away from Egypt made what he calls an  unbelievably astonishing  discovery: a 2,500-year-old coffin that had always been assumed to be empty actually wasn't. Australian scientists led by Dr. Jamie Fraser of the University of Sydney's Nicholson Museum tells the BBC the  dowdy-looking  sarcophagus, one of four the museum's founder obtained from Egypt nearly 160 years ago, had been largely ignored in favor of the other three, which contained mummies. Reuters describes it as a chance find made when scientists decided to lift the lid in June. The university's Muse magazine reports the coffin hadn't been opened in 20 years, and that it was recorded as containing  mixed debris.  Not so: Inside was about 10% of a human body, comprised of feet and other bones. The rest was likely ravaged by tomb raider. CT scans and an excavation concluded last week, though that won't be the end of the research. As Fraser explains, the bones present a unique research opportunity, in that it's not considered ethical to test fully intact mummies; a partial one skirts that limitation.  We can't do anything to the remains that the tomb raiders haven't already done,  Fraser notes. Radiocarbon testing will confirm whether the remains are indeed from about 600BC, as hieroglyphics on the coffin suggest. Those markings say it was made for a woman named Mer-Neith-it-es, who was possibly a high priestess. Australia's ABC quotes Egyptologist Connie Lord as describing another  incredible  and  incredibly rare  find: The resin that was poured into the mummy's skull post-brain removal remains; she describes it as similar to the one found in King Tut's coffin.

In the 80 years of records on such things, the previous season's high was five, reports AP. And the total doesn't count two other attacks in South Carolina. In today's attack, the victim survived after a shark estimated to be 7 feet long dragged him under in waist-deep water and bit him repeatedly. He was able to swim to shore, reports WSOC, though there was no immediate word on his condition. Experts are floating several theories on what might be going on. One is that an especially hot June has caused fish to begin migrating north earlier than usual. Combine that with a general increase in beach attendance.  So when you have more marine life in general in the water and then more people heading to the beach than usual, then you've got a potential recipe for accidents to happen,  says a shark researcher at East Carolina University.

In an effort to solve its 2012 mystery, Atlas Logistics Group Retail Services—which operates warehouses that store products en route to grocery stores—swabbed some of its employees to collect their DNA. Jack Lowe and Dennis Reynolds were two of them, and their DNA didn't match that taken from the poop, which had been found in the aisles and on canned goods. So they sued. Courthouse News Service reports that they cited the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which  generally prohibits  a company from asking its workers to hand over their genetic info.

"(Mar 5, 2014  4:17 PM) Warding off the specter of election-year health insurance cancellations, the Obama administration today announced a two-year extension for individual policies that don't meet requirements of the new health care law. The decision helps defuse a political problem for Democrats in tough re-election battles this fall, especially for senators who in 2010 stood with President Obama and voted to pass his health overhaul. The extension was part of a major package of regulations that sets ground rules for 2015, the second year of government-subsidized health insurance markets under Obama's law—and the first year that larger employers will face a requirement to provide coverage. It's not clear how many people will be affected by the two-year extension on policies that were previously subject to cancellation. The administration cites a congressional estimate of 1.5 million, counting individual plans and small-business policies.  It's not likely to affect a large number of people, but it certainly avoids difficult anecdotes about people having their policies canceled,  said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, an expert on insurance markets.

He was 73 years old. Police say Simon and the injured driver had to be cut out of the vehicle after it hit a Mercedes and then slammed into metal barriers, the AP reports. No arrests have been made and the accident is still under investigation. In 45 years at CBS, the Bronx native won awards that included four Peabody Awards and an amazing 27 Emmys, according to the network, whose president describes him as a  giant of broadcast journalism.  In a war reporting career that began in Vietnam, where he was on one of the last helicopters out of Saigon,  in addition to several short detentions, close calls, and wounds,  he was captured by Iraqi forces at the beginning of the Gulf War and spent 40 days in Iraqi prisons with three other members of the news team, CBS says. The death  is such a tragedy made worse because we lost him in a car accident, a man who has escaped more difficult situations than almost any journalist in modern times,  says 60 Minutes producer Jeff Fagen.  Bob was a reporter's reporter.",60 Minutes' Bob Simon Killed in Car Crash,____ Minutes' Bob Simon Killed in Car Crash,60,Copy( 60 ),0

Heather Grogg, 33, worked as a live-in babysitter at the home of David Sanford Jr., one of three men charged in the March 18 murder of Jonathan Riddle. In the midst of an argument, Riddle was stabbed twice at Sanford's home, then taken to a rural area in West Virginia, where he was fatally stabbed and set on fire, according to police. Grogg seemed shocked by Riddle's murder, her sister tells NBC News. But  I'm worried she witnessed something she shouldn't have seen,  says Brandie Hebb.  It's not like her to just disappear.  Hebb last heard from her sister, a mother of four, on April 3. Grogg  seemed a little stressed  and  wanted to see me face-to face,  but the sisters opted to forgo a meeting owing to the statewide stay-at-home order. Authorities believe Grogg may be with the other missing woman, 18-year-old Danielle Tyler, who frequented Sanford's home and was dating another of the murder suspects, Monroe Merrell, with whom Riddle apparently argued. Grogg and Tyler were last seen together in Carroll County on April 6, days before the suspects were arrested, per CBS Baltimore. That was also the last time Tyler's grandmother heard from the high school senior.  I think I am going to turn my phone off for a little bit … I am just tired of all the drama,  Tyler wrote in a text, per People.

His popular Gibson Les Paul guitar and his recording inventions helped him  change the course of 20th-century popular music.  Paul learned to be a  one-man ensemble  by pairing machines and layering recordings; he later built the first eight-track recorder. The Gibson Les Paul has been played by rockers from Jimmy Page to Slash. Paul was also a successful musician in his own right.

"(Jan 30, 2017  5:03 AM) Two men were charged Friday with roles in Ponzi schemes that cheated wealthy people, including some who believed they were investing in ticket businesses for popular shows like an Adele concert and Broadway's Hamilton. Joseph Meli, 42, of Manhattan, and Steven Simmons, 48, of Wilton, Conn., were arrested on charges alleging they enticed wealthy individuals to make multimillion-dollar investments, the AP reports. The SEC said in a civil complaint that the Ponzi schemes led people in 13 states to invest $81 million. Meli's scheme included investments in businesses that would buy large blocks of tickets for major concerts and musicals, authorities said. The SEC said at least $51 million of the $81 million was diverted to pay off other investors or for personal expenses of the co-conspirators. Simmons wasn't charged in the civil complaint, but both men were charged criminally with conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud. According to a criminal complaint, the fraud stretched from November 2015 through January, and the Ponzi schemes developed as investors demanded their money.  Meli allegedly made up out of whole cloth purported deals to buy Broadway tickets that he could later sell at a profit,  Deputy US Attorney Joon H. Kim says.  But as alleged, Meli was just robbing Peter to pay Paul.  William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the FBI's New York office, notes that the defendants had joked about their Ponzi scheme, saying it was a  shell game.

"(May 24, 2018  6:11 AM CDT) The missile system used to shoot down MH17 over eastern Ukraine four years ago, killing 298 people, came from the Russian military, Dutch investigators revealed Thursday. Investigators previously concluded the Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down on July 17, 2014, by a missile launched by a Russian-made Buk missile system moved into territory held by Moscow-backed rebels in Ukraine, then returned to Russia, per the Guardian. The Joint Investigation Team's latest report is the first to directly link the missile system to Russian armed forces. Specifically, investigator Wilbert Paulissen of the Dutch National Police says photo and video evidence traces the Buk—which has  unique characteristics  that  served as a type of fingerprint —to the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade in Kursk, western Russia, reports the Telegraph. It is  legal and convincing evidence which will stand in a courtroom,  investigators say, with Paulissen noting  all the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces,  per Reuters. But though investigators are focused on several dozen possible suspects, down from more than 100, they say it's too early to bring charges. Per the Guardian, any eventual trial will be held in the Netherlands, from which two-thirds of victims hailed, as Russia, denying involvement, has vetoed an international tribunal at the UN. Meanwhile, family members of Australian victims have penned an open letter to Russians ahead of June's World Cup.

It took me so long to be able to ask for somebody to help me,  Harding said, before Morgan interrupted.  It suits you to play the victim  when  it was Nancy Kerrigan who had her Olympic dream shattered,  he said, per the Hollywood Reporter.

As a testament to their non-belief and a protest to the granite slab they sought to remove, American Atheists unveiled their own monument yesterday: A bench that sports quotes from the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and John Adams.

On the night of Aug. 30, Becki Falwell told dispatchers her husband had called her saying he'd tumbled down the stairs of their Virginia house and was bleeding, so she came home, found the doors locked, and broke the back door open with a chair.

An officer said  Jerry had slurred and slowed speech and would repeat things already asked.  But Becki later issued a statement saying Jerry had only slipped on two small steps leading to a bedroom, and  alcohol was not a factor in the fall.

It's not about Harriet Tubman, it's about keeping the picture on the $20,  Rep.

The budget deal the Democratic governor hammered out raises the minimum wage in New York City to $15 by the end of 2018, but it won't reach that level in the city's suburbs until 2022, the New York Times reports.

You can't raise a family on $18,000 a year in the state of New York. So we want to raise the minimum wage, which in and of itself would affect 2.3 million workers.

Prosecutors say Harold Henthorn—charged with first-degree murder in the Sept. 29, 2012, death of Toni Henthorn, 50—staged his wife's death to look like an accident because he stood to benefit from life insurance policies totaling $4.7 million that she didn't know existed. Ranger Paul Larson said he could not find the diamond in the craggy, secluded area where authorities found her body. Henthorn told investigators he moved his wife's body to flatter terrain so he could tend to her after the fall. Investigators previously said they suspected Henthorn of removing the diamond from his wife's ring, in part because her hand was not badly injured in the fall. A deputy coroner said he found it odd that Henthorn quickly volunteered information about the diamond when interviewed, saying it was worth $30,000 but  the missing stone did not matter at all at this point.  Larson added he and other investigators noted more unusual details from the scene. For example, even though Toni Henthorn's fall was hard and fast enough to break large tree branches, her camera landed almost completely intact just feet from where her husband moved her body, Larson said.

(In previous attempts to free himself from prison, Fogle has argued that the conspiracy charge does not apply to his crimes. Last week, Fogle also made another attempt to get himself freed, filing paperwork seeking a writ of habeas corpus from the federal court in Denver, Reuters reports.

"(Feb 14, 2012  6:33 PM) House-Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut that delivers about $20 a week to the average worker yielded a tentative agreement today, with lawmakers hopeful of unveiling the pact tomorrow and sending the measure to President Obama as early as this week. Under the outlines of the emerging agreement, a 2-percentage-point cut in the Social Security payroll tax would be extended through the end of the year, with the nearly $100 billion cost added to the deficit. Jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed would be renewed as well, with the $30 billion cost paid for in part through auctioning broadcast spectrum to wireless companies and requiring federal workers to contribute more toward their pensions. The payroll tax cut and renewing jobless benefits were key planks in Obama's jobs program, which was announced in September. The payroll tax cut benefits 160 million Americans and delivers a tax cut of about $20 a week for a typical worker making $50,000 a year.

A quick rebound followed, however, to less severe numbers. The Dow finished down 348 points at 10,520; Nasdaq fell 83 points to 2,320; and the S&P fell 38 to 1,128. For many traders, the chaotic freefall recalled the worst days of trading in 2008, when the wounds of the financial crisis were still fresh. This time, however, the US economy seemed not to play a major role. Instead, fears of the financial state of Europe, driven by Greece's continuing debt problems, drove investors out of stocks and risky bonds and into safe bets like Treasuries and gold, notes the Wall Street Journal. The sell-off was exacerbated by software at trading firms that automatically sells to stem losses if the indices fall below certain points.

On Thursday, 22-year-old Noah Lyles was a contender in the 200-meter race in the Inspiration Games, in which 30 runners competed virtually from seven locations around the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic, per Runner's World. Running on a track in Bradenton, Fla., Lyles, the reigning 200-meter world champ, finished in an astounding 18.90 seconds—breaking his own personal best of 19.50, as well as Usain Bolt's world record of 19.19 seconds set in 2009.

The fact that Lyles was running into a headwind made it seem even more unlikely, the New York Daily News notes. As it turns out, it wasn't right: Organizers had Lyles line up in the wrong track lane, meaning the distance he had to run was cut to just 185 meters. Adjusted for 200 meters, Lyle's time would've been around 20.4 seconds—which still would've beat his competitors, except he was disqualified from the race.

How the discovery was made: The House committee looking into the Benghazi debacle subpoenaed correspondence from longtime Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and the State Department cross-referenced the emails he handed over and the ones Clinton did. It found nine emails Blumenthal had were completely missing from her files, as well as parts of six others. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chair of the Benghazi committee, calls the findings  significant  and  troubling  and says that Blumenthal was passing along  unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat  from a source who reportedly had a financial interest in Libya, reports Fox News. But Clinton aides say she handed over all Blumenthal emails, plus a dozen more that he didn't turn in—and that there's no proof the 15 messages in question were actually sent in the form of an email, as Blumenthal compiled the records he handed over into a Microsoft Word document, the AP reports. Officials say that while some are Libya-related, the Blumenthal messages to Clinton don't directly deal with the 2012 Benghazi attacks: Instead, they discuss topics such as media reports about the death of one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons and the inner workings of Libyan rebels. Gowdy isn’t convinced the messages are moot, however.  This has implications far beyond Libya, Benghazi, and our committee's work,  he said in a statement, per CNN.

She was released on bail of $10 million Canadian—around $7.5 million American—after BC Supreme Court Justice William Ehrcke decided the bail terms were enough to  offset the risk  of the Chinese citizen fleeing Canada during proceedings to extradite her to the US, where she is accused of violating sanctions on Iran, the Vancouver Sun reports. He said $7 million Canadian of the bail must be paid in cash. The five guarantors include a man who pledged his $1.8 million home. Under the bail conditions, Meng, 46, is required to wear an ankle bracelet and surrender her travel documents, the CBC reports. She will not be allowed to leave the province of British Columbia and she will be under surveillance 24 hours a day, which she has agreed to pay for herself.

Three historians who reviewed film footage and other photos say Cpl Harold 'Pie' Keller, not Pfc. Rene Gagnon, was one of the six men seen raising an American flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima on Feb. 23, 1945, the Guardian reports. Their findings have been confirmed by a Marines investigative board and investigators from the FBI's digital evidence lab. Keller, the second man from the right, is the most obscured of the six Marines in photographer Joe Rosenthal's famous image. Keller, a Purple Heart winner from Brooklyn, Iowa,  never spoke about any of this when we were growing up ,  daughter Kay Maurer, 70, tells NBC.  Regardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps’ cherished history,  the Marines said in a statement. The flag-raising captured by Rosenthal was the second one that day: Hours after the first one went up, a commander decided a bigger one would improve morale. Gagnon  played a significant role in the flag raising on Mount Suribachi and his role will never be diminished,  the Marines said.  He was directly responsible for getting the larger second flag to the top and returning the first flag for safe keeping. Without his efforts, this historical event might not have been captured, let alone even occurred.  Keller and Gagnon both died in 1979. Three of the Marines in the photo were killed in action on Iwo Jima.

Aspirin is already recommended for people with a history of heart trouble, and the US Preventive Services Task Force now says a daily dose will help prevent people at risk from developing heart problems, as well as help cut their risk of colorectal cancer, reports the New York Times. The panel defined people at risk as those 50 to 69 with more than a 10% risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years, which can be calculated here. Long-term use of aspirin can, however, trigger potentially fatal bleeding in the stomach or the brain, and the nation's health experts are fiercely debating the wisdom of the task force's advice. The FDA said last year that it doesn't believe evidence supports the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic tells the Washington Post. He says it's an  incredible paradox  that two arms of government are giving conflicting advice—and he sides with the FDA. Meanwhile, the chief of cardiology at Georgetown University tells NBC News that he hopes the advice will at least make more people aware of the benefits and risks of aspirin, helping the right people to start taking it and the wrong people, including those at higher risk of bleeding, to stop.

Police officials first indicated the explosion could have been caused by some sort of electrical malfunction but the prime minister said it was deliberate. Al-Shabab—an Islamist militant group from Somalia—has threatened to carry out such an attack. Al-Shabab's threat to carry out large-scale attacks here followed Kenya's decision last October to send troops into Somalia to pursue the Islamist militants.

Had his death occurred five years earlier it likely would have gone quietly unnoticed. But in 2008, Karason went on the Today show to talk to Matt Lauer about something most unusual: his blue skin. Karason says he started turning blue a decade and a half ago, the result of applying and ingesting silver. He was trying to treat dermatitis on his face and had used what the Christian Post describes as  a silver-based remedy  along with colloidal silver. NBC News explains that the latter was something he drank, and describes it as a liquid Karason made himself that has silver particles suspended in it. He consumed 10 ounces a day, notes ABC News. It was outdated medicine, however: Though silver had been used as medicine for thousands of years, it was effectively replaced by penicillin in the 1930s, and was banned by the FDA because it causes argyria, in which silver amasses in the skin and organs and stays there. It causes the blue coloration. The Post notes that Karason was known by some children as  Papa Smurf,  but bristled when adults used the term, according to his estranged wife. In addition to his troubled marriage, Karason fought prostate cancer and health problems, and struggled financially. He noted in a 2012 interview,  People are reluctant to hire blue people.

If I thought the wall was negative, I wouldn't have had the wall,  says Magerko, who believes a border wall is needed  to keep America safe.  A company press release describes the ad as part of a recruitment campaign, with the door symbolizing  the doors that 84 Lumber opens for its employees.

Details are sketchy, but police in St. Charles County, Missouri, responded to a medical emergency at Berry's home Saturday afternoon, but he was unresponsive and could not be revived. Berry first hit the Top 10 in 1955 with  Maybellene,  and remained a rock fixture from then on. Coming later was the iconic  Johnny B. Goode,  (watch that one here) and a slew of classics such as  Roll Over Beethoven,   Sweet Little Sixteen,   School Days,   Rock and Roll Music,   Back in the USA,  and  Memphis, Tennessee.  As Rolling Stone puts it, his  rollicking songs, springy guitar riffs and onstage duck walk defined (rock and roll) during its early years and for decades to come.  The Washington Post notes that he was not only a  seminal figure  in rock's early days, he was a rarity in that he wrote, sang, and played his own music. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen are just a few of those who considered him a major influence. In fact, John Lennon once famously said,  If you tried to give rock-and-roll another name, you might call it ‘Chuck Berry.'

It also sums up his influence on music this way:  While Elvis Presley gave rock its libidinous, hip-shaking image, Berry was the auteur, setting the template for a new sound and way of life.

Such is the case in Fairfax, Va., where a 12-year-old girl faces criminal charges of computer harassment and threatening her school after she posted a message to Instagram in December that included the words  Killing  and  meet me in the library Tuesday  along with gun, bomb, and knife emojis, the Washington Post reports. A school resource officer at Sidney Lanier Middle School learned of that post and others, and after interviewing students and seeking to obtain the IP address associated with the Instagram account, determined the 12-year-old Lanier student made the posts. She admitted to doing it, according to a search warrant, though she posted under the name of another student. Ultimately, Fairfax County schools deemed the threat  not credible,  a spokesperson says, but the girl was still charged. Her mother says her daughter is  a good kid  who's  never been in trouble before,  but that she posted the messages because she was getting bullied at school. A judge will ultimately have to determine whether the emojis she used were truly threatening, and the Post notes it's not the first time: A grand jury in New York recently declined to indict a 17-year-old who posted a police officer emoji followed by three gun emojis on Facebook and was charged with making a terrorist threat, and that's just one of several similar cases recently.

"(Dec 11, 2015  12:03 AM) A grand jury has indicted two Louisiana city marshals on second-degree murder charges in last month's shooting death of 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis. Police say ex-cop Norris Greenhouse Jr., 23, and Marksville police Lt. Derrick Stafford, 32, were moonlighting as Marksville city marshals when they fired into a vehicle driven by Jeremy's father, Chris Few, who was unarmed, reports NBC News, which notes that the charges carry a mandatory punishment of life in prison without parole. In a court filing released Thursday, a police officer who witnessed the incident says he didn't fire his own weapon because  he didn't fear for his life,  KATC reports. The court filing also confirmed that body camera video from the incident, which state police investigators have called  extremely disturbing,  shows that Few had his empty hands in the air when police opened fire, per KATC. Few was shot twice and critically injured, while his autistic son was shot five times and died at the scene. Outside the courthouse, Jeremy's grandmother called for the release of the video and said the shooting has been a living nightmare for the family, the AP reports.  It's been pure hell. I can't explain what it's like to bury your 6-year-old grandchild,  she told reporters, adding that Jeremy's younger sister doesn't understand what happened and is  still asking to see her brother every day.",Louisiana Marshals Indicted in 6-Year-Old's Death,Louisiana Marshals Indicted in ____-Year-Old's Death,6,Copy( 6 ),0

"(Apr 10, 2020  3:32 AM CDT) It looked like a white splotch on the underside of a Neanderthal stone tool. But a microscope showed it was a bunch of fibers twisted around each other. Further examination revealed it was the first direct evidence that Neanderthals could make string, and the oldest known direct evidence for string-making overall, researchers say. The find implies our evolutionary cousins had some understanding of numbers and the trees that furnished the raw material, they say. It's the latest discovery to show Neanderthals were smarter than modern-day people often assume. Bruce Hardy, of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and colleagues report the discovery in a paper released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. The string hints at the possibility of other abilities, like making bags, mats, nets, and fabric, they said. It came from an archaeological site in the Rhone River valley of southeastern France, and it's about 40,000 to 50,000 years old, the AP reports. Researchers don't know how Neanderthals used the string or even whether it had been originally attached to the stone cutting tool. It was made of fiber from the inner bark of trees. Neanderthals twisted three bundles of fibers together counterclockwise, and then twisted these bundles together clockwise to make the string. That assembly process shows some sense of numbers, Hardy said.","50K Years Ago, Neanderthals Were Making String","____K Years Ago, Neanderthals Were Making String",50,"Paraphrase( 50,000 , K )",1

And while that is typically the case in the city's shootings—they involve one or two victims at a time—a separate Tribune article notes that sprayed gunfire that hits multiple victims isn't that uncommon: It counts 89 shootings involving three victims since the start of 2012, another 31 shootings with four victims, and nine more with five victims.

Family members say Walnut resident Harry Sentoso had applied for dozens of other jobs and was excited about returning to work at the Irvine center, where he had done seasonal work in the past; it had laid him off weeks earlier. They say he started feeling unwell six days after starting work but didn't want to miss a shift so soon after returning to work.

"(Feb 24, 2011  5:00 PM) It took a decade and two false starts, but Boeing has finally landed the massive Air Force contract to build the military's next generation of refueling planes, reports the Seattle News. The decision surprised plenty of defense analysts who figured that the $35 billion contract would go to Europe's EADS, which planned to build the tankers in Alabama, much to the delight of Gulf Coast politicians. Boeing says the deal secures 11,000 jobs in Washington state when factoring in all the businesses that serve its workers. The contract has been awarded twice before—to Boeing in 2001 and to EADS/Northrop Grumman in 2008—only to be yanked back both times amid challenges and controversy.

The bizarre case is from India, where doctors diagnosed the toddler with premature puberty, reports the International Business Times. They gave him injections for two years to block the secretion of hormones, but the problem was he'd need the expensive shots for another decade, and his parents couldn't afford them. Doctors then opted for brain surgery. They removed abnormal-looking tissue in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that plays a role in regulating hormones, and the chief neurosurgeon gave this happy assessment to the Times of India:  His hormone values became normal for his age, and he does not require any further treatment.",Boy Needs Surgery After Hitting Puberty at 18 Months,Boy Needs Surgery After Hitting Puberty at ____ Months,18,Copy( 18 ),0

Two drivers have been cited as of July 27 for driving too slowly in the left lane since the law took effect July 1, the Idaho Press reported Monday. Idaho State Police have given warnings to three other drivers, with the Press noting these five stops are dwarfed by the 2,495 speeding tickets given out in the same period. Most people expect the general traffic to stay in the right lane and leave the left lanes open for passing, said Lt. Shawn Staley.

But now the shop's manager says the honesty-box tradition may need to end and the store will be locked at night after it was burglarized over the weekend—what many believe to be the first theft in nearly half a century. Stolen were candy, chocolate bars, coffee, batteries, toiletries, and tea-time biscuits, per the store's Facebook page, as well as six hand-knit wool caps made by manager Julie McCabe.  We are all pretty gutted,  she tells the Aberdeen Press and Journal.  I am absolutely floored that someone has been in and did that to our community.  And what the Mirror is calling the island's  crime wave  doesn't stop there: Someone also ripped off the island's beauty shop, apparently on the same night, lifting body butter, bath oils, and shower gels, and money from that store's honesty box.

Officials tell the AP that the provincial governor based in Tikrit is missing, while the New York Times notes that militants encountered precious little resistance and appear to be on their way to Baghdad. They've taken over the town of Baiji, an oil-refining center with 200,000 residents, and they've done so  without firing a shot,  the Times notes. The militants hold a power station that supplies Baghdad and beyond, and residents in the capital fear the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) could come their way next. And with Iraq having lost control of its second-largest city to the Islamist militants, some 500,000 Mosul residents have fled, a watchdog says.  The situation is chaotic inside the city, and there is nobody to help us,  a government worker tells the BBC. An Iraqi provincial official has indicated that leaders are strategizing to retake Mosul, but troops are showing fatigue.  The state is weak,  a deserting soldier tells the Times.

The men were also charged with creating false footage suggesting the country was facing a civil war, the AP reports. Australian Peter Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy, and Egyptian Baher Mohammed had been reporting on protesters backing ousted president Mohamed Morsi and were detained in a December raid on their Cairo hotel room. The trio has been housed in a 13-foot cell for 23 hours a day since, the BBC reports. The prosecution's case was thin: It showed video obtained from the journalists covering a veterinary hospital and Christian life, photos from Greste's family vacation, a news report made while the trio wasn't in the country, and a pop video by the Australian singer Gotye, notes al-Jazeera. (As the New York Times reports,  There was no publicly available evidence that the journalists had either supported the Brotherhood or broadcast anything inaccurate. )  We are deeply concerned that this verdict is part of a broader attempt to muzzle media freedoms,  says Australia's foreign minister.

Per the Arizona Republic, Elaine Herzberg, 49, was killed March 18, 2018, in Tempe by an Uber Volvo SUV as she walked her bike across the street that night, outside a city-designated crosswalk to the north. Rafaela Vasquez, the driver behind the wheel while the vehicle was self-driving, was watching The Voice right before the accident, per a police report. Herzberg's daughter, Christine Wood, and husband, Rolf Ziemann, are now asking for $10 million from Tempe because they say the city had a brick pathway, since removed, that encouraged pedestrians to jaywalk by using the path that was  clearly designed to accommodate people to cross at the site of the accident,  the claim notes. The notice of claim—which the AP explains is a precursor to a lawsuit— says the city also failed to properly light the area and offer other modifications that would have made the site safe to cross, per CBS 5. The city ripped up the path last fall and replaced it with plants and rocks. Legal experts say the family's claim doesn't seem like a strong one.  Generally, the city is not obligated to warn people of open and obvious dangers,  one attorney tells the Republic.  The obligation is in the other direction.

On Tuesday, a jury in Franklin County, Ohio, awarded the 36-year-old elementary school teacher $1,580,000 in compensatory damages and $20 million in punitive damages, the Columbus Dispatch reports. State laws capping such awards may cut the amount by up to 90%, but Kershaw, who has now divorced Jerry Bailey, says the message the victory sends is the important part.  It's brought back a lot of dark times that I tried to grow away from,  she says.  But I really believe that it's going to be healing for me, and this is for all women who have been abused in some way.  Bailey—who was fined $100 after being found guilty of misdemeanor domestic violence in the 2013 attack on his wife—had tried to stop the lawsuit, arguing in legal papers that it was  a complaint of conduct and claims arising out of the marital relationship.  A judge disagreed last fall and allowed the rare spouse-on-spouse civil lawsuit to proceed separately from divorce proceedings. Kershaw's lawyer tells the Washington Post that  attitudes are still behind the times, which I think is why we really haven't seen a case like this.  He tells the Dispatch that he hopes the court victory will send the message that it is  not OK for people to commit domestic violence. And for those who do, there will be consequences.

She explains in a first-person piece in Cosmopolitan, charting her path from drinking alcohol and smoking pot at 18 to taking Xanax and then, finally, taking meth and ecstasy. Along the way she struggled with her mental health—she had a mental breakdown at one point and ultimately found out she has bipolar disorder—as well as other things, having left high school in eleventh grade after missing a lot of school due to work and a heart arrhythmia and, at 17, moving out of her mom's house. Ultimately she left her job, too, and lost her boyfriend and a number of close friends as she continued to struggle with drug abuse. After initially avoiding harder drugs, she was smoking pot with an acquaintance at 19 when she felt a strange, euphoric high. She determined the pot had likely been laced with cocaine or meth, and at a particularly low point, she later decided to try meth and ecstasy. Her addiction progressed to the point that she was shooting meth  as often as I could,  though she tried to stop multiple times.

"(Feb 16, 2011  8:37 AM) Chicago's population fell 6.9% during the decade that ended in 2010, leaving it with fewer people than lived there in 1920. The US Census Bureau reports a population of 2,695,598 people, just under the 2.7 million that were reported nearly a century ago, the Wall Street Journal reports. The recession is likely to blame for a significant migration to the suburbs and the South; even so, Chicago is expected to remain the third-largest city in the nation behind New York and Los Angeles. The Windy City's population peaked at 3.62 million in 1950, then declined for years until it experienced a boom in the 1990s. This most recent decline affected the city's black population more than most; it fell from more than 1 million to 887,608.  The black decline is really powering the city loss,  says a demographer, calling it  part of the great reverse migration to the South.  As Chicago's population fell, however, the population in neighboring counties surged—which could mean those traditionally conservative counties will become more politically diverse.",Chicago's Population Dips Below 1920 Level,Chicago's Population Dips Below ____ Level,1920,Copy( 1920 ),0

"(Mar 28, 2018  7:41 AM CDT) In Italy's own version of Les Misérables, a man who's fought a nearly 10-year legal battle over an eggplant finally got his reprieve from the country's court of last resort. Per AFP, the unnamed man, then 49, was nabbed by cops in 2009 emerging from private property near Lecce in southern Italy, along with a bucket holding a lone eggplant. His excuse: He had no job and needed to feed his child. The police apparently weren't swayed, and so began an almost decade-long wrangle with the justice system, which first hit him with a five-month prison sentence and a $620 fine. On appeal, that penalty was knocked down to just two months behind bars and a $150 fine, but the defendant's lawyers pressed to keep the case alive, bringing it all the way to Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation. It was there that the court did some head-shaking that the case had even made it this far—and cost taxpayers nearly $10,000, per local paper La Repubblica—and acquitted the man, noting he  was definitely acting to satisfy the hunger of his family … there are grounds for justification.

"(Jun 15, 2015  11:43 AM CDT) It's one thing to outlast hundreds or thousands of poker players to win one of the World Series of Poker's 68 events and the Las Vegas tournament's coveted gold bracelet. It's another thing entirely to win a game you've never played before. Christian Pham of St. Paul, Minn., did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons. By accident. The 40-year-old professional poker player says he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold 'em but inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in.  It's a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies,  says a dealer. Essentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it's better if it's a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards. Pham says he didn't realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what.  At first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good,  says Chris Mecklin, who was sitting next to Pham when the newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn't know it would be a fortuitous one. Pham, who moved to the US from Vietnam 15 years ago, says the guidance from his fellow players at the table helped, and he studied up the night in between the two-day contest. In the end, he says it was his tournament acumen for when and how much to bet and manage his chips that got him to the top. On Friday, he was $81,314 richer and held up his gold bracelet.","Guy Enters Pro Poker Event by Mistake, Wins $81K","Guy Enters Pro Poker Event by Mistake, Wins $____K",81,"Round( Paraphrase( 81,314 , K ) , 0 )",1

There have been increasing whispers about that long-anticipated 2016 Bush-Hillary Clinton battle as Jeb's advisers are reportedly asking supporters to hold tight and not start backing other candidates just yet, reports the Wall Street Journal.

Agents arrested Yaser Abdel Said, 63, in Justin, some 36 miles northwest of Dallas. The Egyptian-born suspect had been sought on a capital murder warrant since the New Year's Day 2008 fatal shootings of the two Lewisville High School students, Sarah Yaser Said, 17, and Amina Yaser Said, 18, the AP reports. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2014. A police report says a family member told investigators that the suspect threatened  bodily harm  against Sarah for going on a date with a non-Muslim. The mother, Patricia Said, fled with her daughters in the week before their deaths because she was in  great fear for her life.  Gail Gattrell, the sisters’ great-aunt, has called the deaths an  honor killing,  in which a woman is murdered by a relative to protect her family’s honor.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the same poll also found a number of historical lows when it comes to support for gun control, including a handgun ban (just 26% support one), an assault rifle ban, and stricter gun control laws.",Record 43% of Women Have a Gun in Home,Record ____% of Women Have a Gun in Home,43,Copy( 43 ),0

With help from Canadian and US authorities, police searched the Sea Princess after it docked in Sydney on Sunday and uncovered 210 pounds of cocaine, worth about $23 million, in two cabins, reports La Presse. Quebec natives Isabelle Lagace, 28, Melina Roberge, 22, and Andre Tamine, 63, could now face life in prison for drug smuggling. Authorities say Lagace and Roberge were traveling together, but it isn't clear if they know Tamine. All three boarded the Sea Princess in Britain in July, authorities say. The ship then embarked on a 66-day world tour, making stops in Canada, the US, Caribbean, South America, and New Zealand. The Australian Border Force isn't sure when or where the drugs were brought on board but says the accused were working with a  very well organized syndicate,  per the Sydney Morning Herald.

The team says Bryant will not travel with the team for Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs so he can tend to the legal matter. The State Highway Patrol says Saunders was cited for driving under the influence. Patrol spokesman Lt. Craig Cvetan also says a gun was confiscated from Saunders' car. He says information about the gun will be forwarded to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office since Saunders does not have a concealed weapons permit. Browns general manager Ray Farmer said in a statement Saturday that the team takes the charges against the players  seriously  and calls it  extremely disappointing that these two individuals would put themselves in this situation by making such poor decisions.  It's not clear why Bryant was arrested along with Saunders, though the highway patrol says more information will be made available after 10pm Saturday.

Both, though based on what's being reported about the Indian property developer based in the UAE, it's hard to believe the latter. Sahni owns six Rolls-Royces, and two of his existing luxury cars boast a very special accouterment: license plates bearing one solitary number. One plate features the number  9,  while the second claims  5 —and Sahni paid $9 million for it at a government auction in October, making it one of the largest amounts ever forked over for a novelty plate. The Independent notes he purchased another plate through the same auction for an additional million bucks. As for the No. 9 plate, Sahni, who's based in Dubai, had ponied up $6.7 million last year, underscoring the desire of the UAE elite to get their hands on the coveted single-digit plates. Big business has sprung up around these types of license plates, with private firms trying to get in on the secondary market where the license plates are traded. The record for license plate expenditures was set by an Arab businessman who paid around $14.4 million for the No. 1 plate in Abu Dhabi in 2008. Some people are criticizing Sahni for blowing his cash on these luxury tags.  It's hard, people giving comments without knowing the type of person I am,  he tells CNN, noting that because there's no income tax in Dubai, what he's paying for his plates will likely go to charitable and infrastructure endeavors; the city's Roads and Transport Authority didn't say what it would do with its new windfall.

The three men who left for the Central European country in recent days were Uighurs, members of an ethnic Muslim minority from western China who had been detained in Afghanistan as suspected allies of the Taliban and sent to Guantanamo Bay for interrogation. Authorities eventually determined that the 22 Uighurs in its custody had no involvement in terrorism, but the US struggled to resettle them. China requested their return, but they couldn't be sent there because of fears they would face persecution and torture. Many countries refused to accept them out of reluctance to anger Beijing. Congress blocked a US judge's order to release them inside the United States. Eventually, the US relocated Uighurs to Bermuda, Palau, Switzerland, and elsewhere but could not find countries that would take the final three and would also be acceptable to the men—even after a decade of captivity at Guantanamo.

The men, who have three children and had been together 18 years, wed in Delaware in July. Ives died unexpectedly last week, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. It's the second time in as many months the judge ruled that the state must recognize an out-of-state same-sex marriage, Reuters reports.

Michener will also join the lawsuit filed by the first couple, John Arthur and James Obergefell, challenging Ohio's law banning gay marriage as unconstitutional. The suit argues that Ohio recognizes other types of out-of-state marriages that would not have been allowed in the state, such as marriages between minors or cousins. In his ruling yesterday, the judge cited the Supreme Court's rejection of DOMA, and noted,  The issue whether states can refuse to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages is now surely headed to the fore.

Hatch had battled cancer in recent years, but the San Francisco Chronicle says she was hospitalized due to a severe cold. She died after returning home Thursday. Hatch had been served with an eviction notice Feb. 11 giving her 60 days to move out of the cottage she had been living in for 66 years. She said a recently widowed friend who owned the home asked her to move in all those years ago, and promised she could live there the rest of her life, a promise that was kept by the friend's daughter and granddaughter but reneged by the granddaughter's estranged husband after his wife was murdered. The husband, the current landlord of the house, claimed he felt awful about having to evict her, but said the agreement was not put into writing. He said his wife's trust was expiring this year and he needed to sell the house in order to make sure his sons were provided for. Hatch's story went viral, prompting many offers of help, and the law firm representing her filed a suit against the landlord last week alleging breach of contract, elder abuse, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Others offered alternate housing arrangements, but Hatch was agoraphobic and did not want to move.

"(Aug 2, 2016  3:30 AM CDT) If Alfred  Skip  Nichols had been a commercial airplane pilot, he probably would have been grounded long ago. Nichols, the pilot of a hot air balloon that crashed over the weekend in Texas, killing 16, was able to keep flying despite having at least four convictions for drunk driving and twice spending time in prison—pointing to gaps in oversight of hot air balloon pilots, the AP reports. Whether the pilot's drinking habits had anything to do with the crash is unclear. A former girlfriend described Nichols as a recovering alcoholic and said he had been sober for at least four years and never piloted a balloon after drinking. The Federal Aviation Administration might allow a recovering alcoholic to fly commercial jets if the pilot was being successfully treated, says an aviation safety expert. But the agency is unlikely to accept an airline pilot with convictions for driving under the influence, he adds. Nichols, 49, got his commercial license to pilot hot air balloons in Missouri in July 1996. His first drunk-driving conviction came in 1990, followed by two more convictions in 2002 and a fourth in 2010, according to online court records. He was also convicted of a drug crime in 2000 and spent about a year and a half in prison before being paroled. He was returned to prison in April 2010 after his parole was revoked because of his drunk-driving conviction that year. He was paroled again in January 2012. Nichols also had a long history of customer complaints against his balloon-ride companies in Missouri and Illinois dating back to 1997. Customers reported to the Better Business Bureau that their rides would get canceled at the last minute and their fees never refunded. Investigators say they do not yet know why the balloon hit high-tension power lines before crashing early Saturday.

"(Feb 4, 2016  4:52 AM) Big changes lie ahead at CBS and Viacom, where 92-year-old chairman Sumner Redstone is stepping down amid lawsuits and power struggles. CBS announced on Wednesday that Redstone has resigned to become  chairman emeritus  and that CBS CEO Leslie Moonves will take his place, the New York Times reports. A source tells the Wall Street Journal that Redstone, who controls around 80% of voting stock in CBS and Viacom, will also step down from the latter company, though the decision will not be finalized until a board meeting on Thursday. Redstone, who built a $39 billion media colossus out of the theater chain his father founded in 1936, had long insisted that he would step down—and never die—but recent years have seen what the Times calls  Shakespearean twists and turns  over the future of his empire. In a lawsuit brought by ex-girlfriend Manuela Herzer last year after she was removed from authority over Redstone's health decisions, she describes him as a  living ghost  with diminished mental capacity. Redstone's lawyers have labeled the ongoing lawsuit a meritless,  despicable invasion of his privacy.  The Times notes that it has already brought up  embarrassing  information about the media mogul's physical deterioration, sexual appetite, and  obsession with eating steak.  In another twist, Redstone's daughter Shari issued a statement Wednesday saying that her father wanted her to succeed him but she nominated Moonves instead to be a  leader with an independent voice,  the AP reports.

"(Mar 13, 2019  4:50 PM CDT) Billionaire Ken Griffin made headlines in January when the Chicagoan purchased the penthouse at 220 Central Park South in New York City for $238 million, making it the priciest home ever sold in the US—by about $100 million. A rep for the Citadel hedge fund founder said he intended to use the 24,000-square-foot home when he's in New York to work at a new Citadel office there, and the decision  seemingly set the stage for New York's sudden embrace  of a first-in-America tax on uber-luxe second homes, writes the New York Times. The pied-à-terre tax, as it's known, is en force in cities like Paris, Singapore, and Vancouver; a proposal currently being considered by the State Legislature would apply a  sliding tax surcharge  to second homes in the city that are valued at more than $5 million. The revenue could be substantial: Based on 2017 numbers, 5,400 NYC homes would be subject to the tax, and Gov. Cuomo projects some $9 billion in bonds could be raised off the revenue, money that could go toward fixing the city's crumbling subway system, bus network, and regional rail—a fix that Bloomberg reports is pegged at $40 billion. But Politico flags the possibility of  cruel irony,  writing that the prime opportunity for a pied-à-terre tax may have come and gone as  foreign investment in real estate here may be slowing down as the growth in global wealth cools.  Real estate professionals say that downturn is real and warn such a tax could exacerbate it. A former finance commissioner says the city's dated property tax system is the real problem: Griffin currently stands to pay $516,000 in taxes a year, but if his penthouse was taxed at the single-family rate applied in Queens or Staten Island, it would be 4 times that amount.",This $238M Penthouse Could Be Hit With Totally New Tax,This $____M Penthouse Could Be Hit With Totally New Tax,238,Copy( 238 ),0

The head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, told a daylong General Assembly meeting on trafficking that 17% are trafficked to perform forced labor, including in homes and sweat shops. He said $32 billion is being earned every year by unscrupulous criminals running human trafficking networks, and two out of every three victims are women. And a law professor adds that the figure of 2.4 million people trafficked at any time is not reflective of the overall problem because  at the end of 10 years you will have a significantly larger number who have gone through the experience.

When Sandy Hatte, 60, tried to enroll the boy at a school in northern Missouri, the official contacted police and discovered the boy had been abducted 13 years ago. Hatte—the boy's paternal grandmother, according to WDAF—has been charged with felony child abduction. Investigators say she had no legal rights to the child but had attempted to portray herself as his mother, the St. Joseph Post reports. One day in 2000, the boy's father  was working, came home from work, and [Hatte] was gone with the baby,  a police spokesman tells ABC.  He hasn't been able to find them since.

"(Nov 11, 2013  7:00 AM) In 44 states, the gay spouse of an active-duty National Guard member can register for a military spouse ID card at his or her partner's base and begin getting federal marriage benefits. But in six states, it's not so easy. As the New York Times explains, bases in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia haven't followed the Pentagon's order regarding benefits, and instead have instructed couples to travel (often long distances to) federal bases to get the ID. Their logic: The National Guard units are state agencies that have to adhere to state laws—like gay marriage bans. Says Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin: Sending gay military couples to federal bases  protects the integrity of our state Constitution and sends a message to the federal government that they cannot simply ignore our laws or the will of the people.  The Times recounts the story of one couple whose registration for benefits was rejected at Camp Mabry in Austin, with officials there suggesting the pair head to Fort Hood, which is 70 miles away. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says such a policy  causes division among the ranks, and it furthers prejudice —while breaking federal law.",6 States Defy Pentagon on Gay Military Benefits,____ States Defy Pentagon on Gay Military Benefits,6,Trans( six ),1
"(May 13, 2017  7:00 AM CDT) Pope Francis added two Portuguese shepherd children to the roster of Catholic saints Saturday, honoring young siblings whose reported visions of the Virgin Mary 100 years ago turned the Portuguese farm town of Fatima into one of the world's most important Catholic shrines. Francis proclaimed Francisco and Jacinta Marto saints at the start of a mass marking the centenary of their visions, the AP reports. Francisco and Jacinta, aged 9 and 7, and their 10-year-old cousin, Lucia, reported that on March 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary made the first of a half-dozen appearances to them here while they grazed their sheep in quiet prayer, reciting rosaries before a statue of the Madonna. They said she confided in them three secrets—foretelling apocalyptic visions of hell, war, communism, and the death of a pope—and urged them to pray for peace and a conversion away from sin.  Our Lady foretold, and warned us about, a way of life that is godless and indeed profanes God in his creatures,  Francis said in his homily, with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims present. The Martos are now the youngest-ever saints who didn't die as martyrs. The siblings died during Europe's Spanish flu pandemic two years after the visions.

"(Apr 16, 2016  1:20 PM CDT) An incredibly rare and valuable stamp stolen right out of its exhibition frame at a 1955 convention resurfaced this month in New York and has promptly rocked the philatelic world.  Inverted Jenny  stamps are considered the most famous in America: A printing accident in 1918 produced a single sheet of 100 of the stamps, each featuring an upside-down Curtiss JN-4H biplane, NPR explains. In 1955, someone swiped a block of four from the collection of Ethel Stewart McCoy, whose father was a Dow Jones founder. It is  one of the most notorious crimes in philatelic history,  Scott English, administrator of the American Philatelic Research Library, tells the AP. The stamp was submitted this month to New York auction house Spink USA by an unnamed man in his 20s who hails from the UK and says he inherited it from his grandfather; it's unclear if he knew it was stolen. A press release from Spink USA states that the inverted Jenny was  determined to be position 76 in the pane of 100 subjects —the one in the bottom right of the block of four stolen. Identification took some sleuthing: In a long-ago attempt to disguise it, the stamp  had been reperforated at right and most of the gum was removed, so the pencil position numbers written on the gummed side had been lost.  Positions 75 and 65 turned up in 1958 and 1982, respectively, and the new discovery leaves only one of the four stolen stamps unaccounted for. (In 2014, a dealer offered a $50,000 reward for the missing inverted Jennies.) The American Philatelic Research Library at the American Philatelic Society was given rights to the stamps by McCoy, who died in 1980, and is working with the auction house to take possession of the stamp.

"(Mar 11, 2013  7:45 AM CDT) How the sequester will hit Yellowstone in general is clear: The park needs to ax $1.8 million from what it anticipated would be a $35 million budget. The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal take a look at the specific fallout: Park superintendent Dan Wenk's plan is to reduce seasonal workers, put permanent hiring on freeze, push back the opening of most entrances by as much as two weeks (squashing 50,000 guests; cutting two weeks from the end of the 20-week season would mean losing 267,000 visitors), and delay the snowplows from March 4 to March 18. That last one is particularly rankling: The sequester went into effect just three days before the annual plowing effort was to begin. Yellowstone's plows typically remove as much as 10 feet of snow from 300 roads, and the hope, explains the Post, is that the sun will  melt and soften the snow,  making it simpler to clear and saving the park $30,000 per day, for up to $250,000 in savings. This means the Montana-Wyoming Beartooth Highway, which the National Park Service typically plows half of, won't be passable until June; Cooke City, which lies on a stretch of highway just outside a northwest entrance, won't see the eight-mile section cleared until late May.  We have 90 days to make a living,  says a whitewater rafting tour guide.  If people get the impression they can’t get into the park, they just won’t come.

Found in 2007 and revealed in a new study, the 9,000-year-old skull seems to have been cut off and buried under limestone slabs—which may make it the oldest decapitated skull given a ritualistic burial in the western hemisphere.  This ritualized decapitation attests to the early sophistication of mortuary rituals among hunter-gatherers in the Americas,  lead researcher Andre Strauss tells CNN. How so? Well, vertebrae found with the skull bear ritualistic V-shaped markings, and two severed hands were positioned over the face with one set of fingers pointing up and the other pointing down, the Washington Post reports. Plus the skull appears to be from a local man, not an outside warrior whose head served as a trophy, notes LiveScience.

So what does it signify?

"(Aug 16, 2014  9:36 AM CDT) The Yazidis who managed to escape to the mountains seem to be protected from Islamic State militants, but those who stayed in their villages clearly are not. Reports from the village of Kocho in northern Iraq say that extremists executed about 80 Yazidi men yesterday and took away about 300 women and children.  They arrived in vehicles and they started their killing,  a Kurdish official tells Reuters.  We believe it's because of their creed: convert or be killed.  A resident of a nearby village said the militants had spent the better part of a week trying unsuccessfully to convince the Yazidis in Kocho to convert to their brand of Islam.  The villagers had received local assurances that they were safe,  Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq’s former foreign minister, tells the Washington Post.  Maybe they killed them in revenge for the setbacks they have suffered from the airstrikes.  The accounts have not been confirmed, though NPR notes that Iraqi officials reported an even larger massacre last week. Elsewhere, the AP reports airstrikes near the giant Mosul Dam in an apparent attempt to wrest control of it back from the militants.

"(Jul 18, 2013  9:40 AM CDT) JPMorgan is considering paying a record $500 million settlement over allegations that California and other states paid its power plants to not produce electricity, the Wall Street Journal reports. The alleged scheme is simple: The states promise to give energy providers  make whole  payments whenever they lose money firing up their plants. So JPMorgan would allegedly post low day-ahead prices to trick states into telling them to turn their plants on, but then come back the next day with drastically higher prices. When states balked, the bank would pocket a profit on the make whole payment. Initially, regulators had wanted a $1 billion fine, but that number has fallen in settlement negotiations. The $500 million would still represent a record for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, though the New York Times points out that it would mean little to JPMorgan, which last week announced a $6.5 billion quarterly profit. Still the settlement is being hotly debated within the bank. Commodities chief Blythe Masters believes the bank did nothing wrong, but others want to strike a deal quickly.

With nearly 82,000 wild horses and burros currently living on rangelands across the West, the Bureau of Land Management will give anyone who adopts one $1,000, Boise State Public Radio reports. Wild horses and burros can damage rangelands, and if their numbers get too high—as they currently are—some of them starve. The current number is more than triple what rangelands can support, Insider reports. So the BLM rounds them up and corrals them, adopting out some of the less feral ones. But most corrals right now are at capacity, and adoptions are down. Hence the incentive program.  The incentive is designed to help with the adopter’s initial training and humane care,  says BLM's deputy director of programs and policy. According to the BLM website, adopters must pay a $25 adoption fee and meet the BLM's requirements for adopting a wild horse or burro. After that, adopters will receive $500 after the adoption and another $500 after titling the animal, which typically occurs about a year after adoption, per the Reno Gazette Journal. A person can adopt and maintain up to four animals per year. The bureau runs a Flickr page with pictures of successful adoptions.  I have had Ella for since 2012, and each year we grow and bond more.

Judge John Saunders said the teenager, who can't be named because of his age, would be released only when he was no longer a danger to the public. He handed down a life sentence with no chance of parole for five years. Prosecutors say the boy planned the attack from his suburban bedroom in Blackburn, northwestern England, inspired by the Islamic State.

Instead, the attacks were so heinous that many Muslims refused to believe that Muslims were responsible, instead blaming the CIA or Mossad.

It alleges Hastert abused him after the boy stopped during a bicycle ride to use the restroom in the summer of 1973 or 1974 in the Game Farm Building in Yorkville, Illinois. The location is now a parking lot for Yorkville High School, where Hastert was a high school wrestling coach, the Chicago Tribune reports. Doe alleges a man opened the door of the stall he was using and sodomized him. He says he saw the man's face but didn't know who he was. Doe alleges that changed a few weeks later when Hastert walked into him gym class at Yorkville Grade School, which is next to Yorkville High School. The suit, filed Friday in Kendall County Circuit Court, says Doe  was traumatized, repressed the sexual assault by Hastert, and was intimidated into silence.  He says about a decade later he tried to report the crime to the Kendall County State's Attorney's office, but says he was warned not to make the accusations public. A hearing in the case is set for Tuesday, reports the AP. The former Republican Illinois congressman, 75, is due to be released from prison as early as July.",Lawsuit Accuses Dennis Hastert of Sodomizing 4th-Grader,Lawsuit Accuses Dennis Hastert of Sodomizing ____th-Grader,4,Trans( four ),1
"(Aug 25, 2016  6:55 PM CDT) Federal prosecutors say a former soldier who lied his way to a Purple Heart by faking injuries from the Iraq war cheated Washington state and the federal government out of more than $750,000, the AP reports. Darryl Wright, a former Idaho National Guardsman, appeared for sentencing Thursday in US District Court, where Judge Benjamin Settle said he wanted to hear additional testimony about Wright's mental health before issuing a punishment. Prosecutors are seeking a five-year prison term, arguing that Wright falsified statements from fellow soldiers to obtain two awards—a Combat Action Badge and the Purple Heart—and then parlayed those medals into a wide range of disability and other benefits, including forgiveness of more than $40,000 in student loans. In applications for benefits, Wright claimed to be so severely disabled that he could only focus his attention for five to 10 seconds, and he said he needed a live-in caregiver. In reality, he served as chairman of his city's planning commission, coached high school basketball, and had held a full-time federal government job in Seattle. Wright claimed Social Security disability benefits, insisting he was frequently bedridden. He also allegedly submitted fabricated National Guard orders in an effort to be paid for a week of skipped work. Wright pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud early this year. Wright's Purple Heart has not been rescinded, prosecutors said.","Vet Fakes War Injuries to Get Purple Heart, $750K in Benefits","Vet Fakes War Injuries to Get Purple Heart, $____K in Benefits",750,"Paraphrase( 750,000 , K )",1

Police are investigating the attack, which occurred shortly after the mom returned home with the boy and his three siblings. The dog, a Cane Corso that neighbors say was trained to attack, belongs to the mother's live-in boyfriend, according to investigators. Family members and neighbors were unable to pull the dog, named Machete, off Jayelin Graham as the animal bit the boy in the head and neck.

He was trained to kill,  the man told the New York Daily News.  He had the boy by his throat. The dog was shaking him. He had no chance.  Jayelin's siblings have been removed from the home by child protection services. The dog has been taken to a shelter and will be observed for 10 days.

Nigerian officials have kept quiet since the guerrilla splinter group Ansaru released a video saying it killed the workers, who were kidnapped Feb. 16 from a construction company. Four were from Lebanon, and one apiece from Italy, Greece, and Britain.  It's an atrocious act of terrorism, against which the Italian government expresses its firmest condemnation,  said Italy's foreign ministry. Greek officials noted the terrorists hadn't negotiated to release the hostages. Online, Ansaru said it killed the hostages partly over reports that British military aircraft were landing in Nigeria.

"(Jul 14, 2016  6:25 PM CDT) Nearly 20 years ago, Longaberger Co. employees moved into their new headquarters in Newark, Ohio—a seven-story, 180,000-square-foot building shaped like a picnic basket. On Thursday, that stay comes to a close as the last of those employees who work in the  Big Basket  move out and over to the company's manufacturing facility in Frazeysburg, about 20 minutes away, the Columbus Dispatch reports. It's a somewhat melancholy ending for a building that the Kansas City Star says was  considered one of the strangest, craziest office buildings in the world,  with Mental Floss giving it a shoutout on its  10 Buildings Shaped Like What They Sell  list a few years back.  It's a Longaberger Medium Market Basket that's been blown up to 160 times its normal size,  the Mental Floss description reads.  The basket includes a seven-story atrium, heated handles that prevent ice formation, and two 725-pound gold leaf Longaberger tags.  Company lore goes that company founder Dave Longaberger became irritated during a building planning meeting, spotted one of his firm's baskets, and told designers:  Make it look exactly like this.  And selling baskets back in 1997 was apparently a booming business worthy of such a structure, which originally held more than 500 employees who brought in sales of $1 billion at the company's peak in 2000. But Longaberger died in 1999, the economy started faltering (meaning basket-buying was no longer a priority), and the company fell behind in taxes on the building: It currently owes more than a half-million dollars, the Newark Advocate reports. As of last year, fewer than 70 employees still worked in the Big Basket, per city records, and the final 10 prepared to clear out Thursday. Still, workers aren't too upset, as they'll now all be in Frazeysburg.

But Trump says the toll would be much higher had his administration not responded the way it has.  That's one of the reasons we're successful, if you call losing 80 or 90,000 people successful,  he said at the Lincoln Memorial event, per CNN.  But it's one of the reasons we're not at the high end of that plane as opposed to the low end of the plane.

The event, which featured questions submitted by viewers across the country, per Deadline, was called America Together: Returning To Work, and indeed, Trump said that though the virus has claimed more lives than he initially expected, parks and beaches as well as some businesses should start opening back up and schools should return to in-person classes by the fall.

The network notes that in 1987's The Art of the Deal, Trump wrote that being written about in the news is a lot more effective than paid advertising, and he seems to be applying the same principle to his campaign with remarkable success.

Shannan, the oldest, was in foster care when middle sisters Sherre and Sarra were molested by Gilbert's boyfriend. Sarra went on to get an abortion at 14, drop out of school at 16, and have a baby with her drug dealer boyfriend in 2009. Shannan, meanwhile, became an escort, and disappeared on Long Island in 2010 in the middle of an escort call. Mari was consumed with the case, pushing cops to continue investigating her daughter's disappearance—and the search for Shannan ultimately led to the discovery of multiple bodies; the still-unsolved Long Island serial killer case is thought to have claimed as many as 16 victims. Then, in 2016, more than four years after Shannan's remains were found, Mari was killed—by Sarra, who stabbed her mother 227 times, possibly attempting to decapitate her, and beat her with a fire extinguisher before spraying it into her mouth in an attempt to drown her. Sarra's life had continued to be difficult long past childhood, Robert Kolker writes in a long look at Mari Gilbert for the Cut. Sarra and her son's father, who served time on drug charges, would frequently split up and then reunite; Sarra ended up in a shelter for victims of domestic violence at least once. After Shannan's remains were found, Sarra suffered an apparent psychotic break and started suffering delusions; she had attacked her mother once before, claiming Mari was a demon. She was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and lost custody of her son to Mari in February 2016 after drowning her dog in the bathtub while her son was home. With the loss of her son, Sarra also lost her government assistance checks and ended up taking illegal drugs and skipping her antipsychotic drugs. By the end of July, Mari was dead.

"(Jul 25, 2010  10:44 AM CDT) Some 100 family members, witnesses, and Air France officials today marked 10 years since a Concorde jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport, plowing into a hotel. Air France flew in family members from Germany, where most of the victims were from, and gave them flowers to place at a monument in Gonesse, made of transparent glass with a piece of an airplane wing jutting through it. Families lay flowers in silence, reports the AP, though officials spoke briefly at the ceremony. A French court is awaiting a verdict in December on who was to blame for the accident, which killed 109 aboard the plane and four on the ground, and devastated the reputation of the jet. Continental airlines and two employees are accused of manslaughter because of reports that a jet dropped a metal strip onto the runway before the Concorde took off. The prosecution says the debris gashed one of the Concorde's tires, sending pieces of rubber into the fuel tanks and sparking a fire.",Families Mark 10th Anniversary of Concorde Crash,Families Mark ____th Anniversary of Concorde Crash,10,Copy( 10 ),0

The shift is hardly shocking, given Brazil's hefty 7.5% economic growth last year, and represents an overall slide back for traditional economic powers in Europe as up-and-comers in Latin America and Asia take hold. It's not all bad news for Britain, however: The Center for Economics and Business Research, which released the rankings, predicts the UK will overtake France's economy by 2016.  I think it's part of the big economic change, where not only are we seeing a shift from the west to the east, but we're also seeing that countries that produce vital commodities—food and energy and things like that—are doing very well and they're gradually climbing up the economic league table,  a CEBR economist says. According to the group's 2020 forecast, the world's top economies, in order, will be: 1) United States; 2) China; 3) Japan; 4) Russia; 5) India; 6) Brazil; 7) Germany; 8) United Kingdom; 9) France; 10) Italy.",Brazil Ousts UK as World's No. 6 Economy,Brazil Ousts UK as World's No. ____ Economy,6,Copy( 6 ),0

"(Jan 3, 2020  9:51 AM) It's a security tip unique to this particular new year: Authorities say people should avoid abbreviating the year 2020 on checks and any other documents. Instead, write out  2020  in its entirety. Why? Writing  1/3/20  or something like that makes it easy for someone to doctor the document by sticking a few numbers onto the end. Consider this example, from Ira Rheingold of the National Association of Consumer Advocates to USA Today:  Say you agreed to make payments beginning on 1/15/20. The bad guy could theoretically establish that you began owing your obligation on 1/15/2019, and try to collect additional $$$,  Rheingold writes. It might not be a high-probability scam, but even police departments—including the East Millinocket department in Maine in this Facebook post—say it's smart advice and  could potentially save you some trouble down the road.  A story at KRON cites another example from auditor Dusty Rhodes in regard to legal papers.

"(Jun 4, 2019  11:05 AM CDT) Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is pitching a $5 trillion-plus climate proposal that he says would lead the US to net zero emissions of carbon pollution by 2050, the AP reports. Biden's plan calls for $1.7 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, with the rest of the investments coming from the private sector. Biden, who discusses the plan in a video posted online, proposes covering the taxpayer costs by repealing the corporate tax cuts that President Trump signed in 2017, while eliminating existing subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.  Science tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet,  Biden said in a statement ahead of the plan's unveiling Tuesday.  That's why I'm calling for a clean energy revolution to confront this crisis and do what America does best—solve big problems with big ideas.  Biden, who announced his candidacy in April and is the clear leader in recent national and early-state primary polls, is offering his climate plan as some of his rivals suggest the 76-year-old former vice president isn't bold enough. Biden's outline tracks some ideas of the Green New Deal pushed by many Democrats in Washington, though Biden isn't as aggressive in his timeline for curbing emissions. Biden's outline is similar in size and scope to what former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke has proposed; it falls short of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's pitch for $3 trillion in federal spending over a decade, which Inslee says will spur $6 trillion more in private investment. The plan has a dual focus on coal towns and nonwhite communities that reflects political lessons from Democrats' 2016 loss.

Police responded to a call about a fight at 2am Wednesday, Officer James Holmes, a Phoenix police spokesman, said. They didn't find anything but then saw a SUV driving slowly with its lights off in the neighborhood. Holmes said officers tried to stop the vehicle, but it sped away. The officers backed off from a chase and turned off their emergency lights, Holmes said. Officers continued to look for the vehicle, heard the squeal of tires, saw a dust cloud and then discovered the crash. The vehicle had driven through the yards of at least four homes, damaging utility boxes and landscaping before hitting the wall between two homes. Police said the 14-year-old driver was found fatally injured inside the vehicle. Three other youths bolted, but police were able to apprehend one of them, a 14-year-old. Police identified the dead 14-year-old as Alonzo Reyes III. Police withheld the identities of the other youths.

"(Jun 7, 2018  1:10 AM CDT) When Justin Trudeau asked him what  national security  issue could possibly justify new tariffs on Canadian imports during a May 25 phone call, President Trump had to reach back a long way, sources tell CNN:  Didn't you guys burn down the White House?  Trump said, referring to a famous incident during the War of 1812. But Trump might not have been paying attention in history class: The 1814 attack, in which troops occupied Washington, DC, and set the White House, Capitol, and other buildings alight after President James Madison fled, was carried out by British troops, not Canadians, in retaliation for an American attack on what is now Toronto. Britain's Canadian colonies did not gain independence until 1867, more than 50 years after the White House burned.  Is Britain off the hook?  the Telegraph quipped. It's not clear if Trump  was attempting to inject humor into a discussion on a topic that could have serious economic repercussions,  the CBC notes, but the leaders will have a chance to discuss it further when Trump visits Quebec for the G7 summit this weekend. According to Canada's Globe and Mail, Trump's recent anti-Canadian sentiment stems not from the 204-year-old incident, but from  dashed expectations.  Trudeau had long largely avoided speaking out against Trump, and the president was apparently surprised when the Canadian leader pushed back against the new tariffs, calling them  insulting and unacceptable.   Trump thought Canada was going to be the easiest country to play, and he’s disappointed that didn't happen,  says Canadian trade lawyer Dunniella Kaufman.

The New York Daily News reports that the elder Stevenson, who came up with the  Sourtoe Cocktail  that has  delighted and disgusted  customers at the Downtown Hotel in Yukon, Canada, for nearly five decades, has died at the age of 89. The former riverboat captain came up with the idea for his signature libation—an alcohol-based drink that has a mummified human toe floating in it—in 1973, when he and some friends found a preserved toe in an abandoned cabin and inexplicably decided to add it to a boozy beverage. Stevenson and his crew also came up with the Sourtoe drinking ritual that made its way to the Downtown and has attracted brave imbibers ever since. To join the  club,  the person downing the cocktail has to make sure their lips actually touch the floating toe. People have donated replacement toes over the years, including an ex-British commando, and in 2017, one of the toes was even stolen. But just as intense as the drink was the man behind it.

The case is only the second one of its kind to go to trial since the passage of a 2005 law shielding gun dealers from such lawsuits, the Journal Sentinel reports; a gun store in Alaska won the previous case. The closely watched case could have major implications nationwide, but the officers' attorney tells the Journal Sentinel that he was out to represent his clients, not send a message.

But engineer Augustine Charahani found the peace of mind to curl up on a flight of stairs and wait over 40 hours in the hope rescuers would find him, the New York Times reports. His ordeal began Sept. 20 in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, where the overcrowded ferry capsized about 160 feet from its destination, Ukara Island. Seems a sudden turn by the pilot or a rush of passengers when disembarking caused the boat to flip. About 40 managed to swim ashore and 228 drowned, per Tanzania's Daily News, which left Charahani alone with the floor above his head and ceiling underwater.  Their screams were so loud,  he recalls of the disaster.  I think they struggled and drowned almost immediately.  Then came the silence and the dark. He screamed for help, rapped his keys on the wall—thought he heard a knock in return once, but no one came—and dared fall asleep with his head nestled on a life jacket.  Anytime I slept, there was a good chance of me sliding and falling back into the water,  he remembers. Charahani says he saw Jesus while asleep and his four children while awake: Who will take care of them? Why had he taken such a dangerous job? Will death take me? Feeling faint and hungry, with the room about two-thirds flooded and air dissipating, Charahani felt a diver grab his ankle. Soon a diving team was ushering him out of the boat and into an ambulance, which took him to an Ukara Island clinic where relatives desperately awaited news about their loved ones.

The Beastie Boys have been awarded $1.7 million in court after Monster Beverage used the band's music in a 2012 promotional ad without permission, E! reports. The money will be divided among Michael  Mike D  Diamond, Adam  Ad-Rock  Horovitz, and the estate of Adam  MCA  Yauch, who died days before the spot aired and had specified in his will that his music was not to be used in ads.

Lakechia Schonta Stanley, 34, has been sentenced to 78 years in prison for the abuse, which included whippings with electrical cords, beatings with blunt objects, and even waterboarding, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Stanley was arrested three years ago when one daughter, then 10, told a librarian she had pain in her arm. She revealed that she had been beaten with a baseball bat for not cleaning the kitchen quickly enough and her 8-year-old sister had been beaten for taking too long in the shower. Stanley's husband, 30-year-old Andrew Rui Stanley, was sentenced to 160 years in prison last year after pleading guilty to 42 felony counts relating to the abuse. Prosecutors say all three children in the home had severe physical—and emotional—scarring. Stanley  was supposed to be their mother, the one person they could trust,  a prosecutor wrote in a sentencing memorandum.

"(Mar 28, 2018  11:15 AM CDT) When baby Owen was born in November,  he couldn't breathe.  It wasn't a fleeting problem. Delivered at about 24 weeks and weighing just 1.4 pounds, the preemie had a rash of additional issues: He was at risk of developing sepsis, had a heart valve that hadn't yet closed, didn't have fully functioning kidneys, was thought to have had both a seizure and pneumonia, and received morphine to dull the pain of all the necessary medical intervention. As Eva Holland writes in a piece for Wired,  his future is a test for how far neonatal medicine has come.  But her story doesn't start with his birth: It documents the treacherous five weeks that preceded it, which began with Canadian Jessica Green's 19-week appointment. Her cervix was rapidly shortening, putting her twins at risk. So doctors essentially sewed it shut. Roughly three weeks later, Baby A's amniotic sac started to leak, and the umbilical cord attached to the fetus slipped into the birth canal. Green was forced to deliver, and say goodbye to, Maia. She made it nearly two more weeks before Owen had to be delivered by emergency C-section. He was given a 60% chance of making it, and Holland details the medical advances that got us to this point. For comparison, she notes that JFK and Jackie's third child, Patrick, was born just 5.5 weeks early; he died on his second day of life. Today, a baby born at that point wouldn't be  in the danger zone at all.  Some 4.5 months after entering the NICU, Owen was out of the danger zone—and on his way home. At 16 months, he's meeting his age-adjusted developmental goals, though Holland details his one  limitation  in the full story.","Things Went Wrong at 19 Weeks, but One Twin Survived","Things Went Wrong at ____ Weeks, but One Twin Survived",19,Copy( 19 ),0

Yet the tiny boy is in control of the big beat of the bass-heavy house music. He's South Africa's youngest disc jockey, DJ AJ. Oratilwe Hlongwane is still learning to put together words, but the toddler is already able to select and play music from a laptop and has become a viral phenomenon on South Africa's social media. His mother credits his father's decision to buy an iPad for his then-unborn son. The father, a gymnastics coach and aspiring DJ, planned to download educational apps to speed up his child's education and also downloaded a disc jockeying app for himself. At about a year old, DJ AJ learned how to manipulate the iPad. Not satisfied with number recognition games, he began to fiddle with his father's DJ app. The parents were blown away when their son, still in diapers, repeated what he had learned on the app on actual DJ equipment, playing with sound effects and bouncing between songs. A cellphone video of him playing went viral and now DJ AJ has more than 27,000 Facebook fans. His newfound fame has brought special appearances and sponsorship deals many older DJs dream of.

You're in a minority, but if so, consider a trip to the Welsh town of Porthcawl—where officials are planning some pretty extreme robo-toilets in Griffin Park, Wales Online reports. The new loos will offer security features designed to hinder violence, vandalism, sleeping, and anything two people might do together (more than one media outlet calls them  anti-sex toilets ). For example, weight sensors will ensure only one person at a time, and sound alarms/water spray will go off if violent movement is detected. Users will also want to avoid triggering a timer alarm that cuts off the lights and heating. And the toilets will shut down for 10 minutes nightly to undergo a deep clean. So why all the high-tech? It's to  support the leisure area within the park  and nearby  retail and commercial businesses,  which have  an important role in growing footfall within the area,  says town councilor Mike Clark.

"(Jul 10, 2015  1:20 PM CDT) General Motors is recalling nearly 780,000 crossover SUVs mainly in North America because the rear power lift gates can suddenly fall and hit people. The company said today that it has 56 reports of injuries caused by the problem. The recall covers the Buick Enclave from 2008 to 2012; the Chevrolet Traverse from 2009 to 2012; the GMC Acadia from 2007 to 2012; and Saturn Outlook from 2007 to 2010. GM says in documents posted today by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that dirt can get into the gas struts that hold up the power rear hatches, causing them to wear and fail. A rod system designed to close the hatches slowly if struts fail may not work because the software controlling it may not detect the problem, GM said. Dealers will replace faulty struts and update lift gate control motor software to prevent rapid closing. The company has not yet come up with a schedule for when the recall will begin. The problem first surfaced in September of 2010 when a company driver reported a lift gate failure. GM investigated, but because the rate of incidents was low at the time, decided to continue monitoring the problem. Last November, GM got two more reports and opened another investigation. This time, it decided a recall was needed, according to documents GM filed with NHTSA. The 56 injury reports were discovered during the second investigation by checking complaints.

In a statement Wednesday, Bayer said it's paying Monsanto shareholders $128 per share in cash, representing a 44% premium over Monsanto's closing price on May 9 (the day before a proposed deal was announced). The $66 billion figure put on the deal by Bayer includes net debt; the equity value is $57 billion, according to slides for an analyst conference call. Monsanto shareholders must approve the deal, expected to close by the end of next year. Anti-trust regulators are also expected to scrutinize the tie-up to determine whether the new business would gain a market-dominating position in any one part of their business.

Now, John France isn't denying that the Disney affair took place. Rather, he's insisting that his 2005 marriage to Lynn, a seaside wedding on Italy's Amalfi Coast,  was never legally proper.  And weirder still: Lynn says that three months ago her husband took their 2-year-old son from her arms, saying he was going to give him some milk...and left. John took their two boys to Tampa, where he currently lives with his new wife and, according to his attorney, is seeking custody of their children, reports the AP. Lynn France called 911, but as in most parental custody disputes, there's little she can do but prepare for a court fight—and get glimpses of her children, ironically, on the same Facebook page where she found those fairy-tale wedding photos.",Wife Learns of Husband's 2nd Wedding on Facebook,Wife Learns of Husband's ____nd Wedding on Facebook,2,Copy( 2 ),0

The 1940 Tudor-style house in Queens is being offered for $725 a night. The listing says the house has five bedrooms and sleeps up to 20 thanks to a slew of bunkbeds. The amenities include a giant cutout of President Trump in the living room, which the listing calls  a great companion for watching Fox News late into the night.  The listing also notes that  not much has been changed since the Trumps lived here, the kitchen is original and the opulent furnishings represent the style and affluence in which the Trumps would have lived.  Smoking, pets, and parties are no-nos, reports the AP. Trump photos and memorabilia appear throughout, though the listing makes clear the home has no ties to the president or White House. The cutout isn't the only quirk. The listing notes guests  have access to the entire house but should note that I live in one of the bedrooms which will not be accessible to you during your stay.  Newsday reports that the principal of Paramount Realty USA, Misha Hagani, confirmed the listing's authenticity. Paramount auctioned the house to an unidentified buyer in March for $2.14 million (some have claimed it was bought by a woman from China). Hagani says he can't disclose whether the home was placed on Airbnb by the property owner or by a leaseholder.","For $725 a Night, You Can Sleep Where Trump Did","For $____ a Night, You Can Sleep Where Trump Did",725,Copy( 725 ),0
"(Dec 6, 2019  4:00 AM) Four people were shot dead after a robbery and truck hijacking came to a bloody end at an intersection in Miramar, south Florida. FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro says the two robbery suspects, a UPS driver, and a person in a nearby vehicle were killed in a shootout at the end of a 20-mile chase, CNN reports. The incident began with the armed robbery of a jewelry store in Coral Gables, around 5 miles west of Miami. A law enforcement source tells the Miami Herald that the two suspects posed as postal workers to gain access to the store. The source says a female employee in the store was injured when a bullet that a robber fired into the floor ricocheted and hit her in the forehead. Police say the suspects hijacked the UPS truck and kidnapped the driver after leaving the store. The FBI says the suspects fired at police during the chase. At one point, the trail of police vehicles behind the truck stretched for around half a mile, according to CNN. The chase ended when the truck encountered stopped traffic, and it's not clear whether police or the suspects fired first. The AP reports that when he was asked if the driver or bystander could have been shot by police, Piro said:  It's very, very early on in the investigation and it would be completely inappropriate to discuss that. We have just began to process the crime scene.  A UPS spokesman said the company was  deeply saddened  to learn the driver was  a victim of this senseless act of violence.",4 Shot Dead After UPS Truck Hijacked,____ Shot Dead After UPS Truck Hijacked,4,Copy( 4 ),0

Sasha Krause, a member of the Mennonite community, was last seen leaving her home in Farmington around 8pm on Jan. 18. She was reported missing early the next day; her vehicle was then found at the Farmington Mennonite Church with items she wouldn't typically have left behind, per the Farmington Daily Times. With little to go on and no sign of Krause almost a month later, the San Juan County Sheriff's Office offered a $50,000 reward for information. A body confirmed as Krause's was then found by a camper between Wupatki National Monument and Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, north of Flagstaff, Ariz., on Friday, report the Daily Times and Arizona Republic.  We were convinced from the start that it was an abduction because we are a close-knit community.

Sasha was a person of deep integrity, very level-headed. There is no one I would have less expected this to happen to.  The eldest of seven children had moved to Farmington from her native Grandview, Texas, where a funeral service is scheduled for this weekend.

"(Apr 25, 2016  8:03 AM CDT) It's long been speculated that Saudi Arabia played a major role in 9/11, and the so-called  28 pages  that have been locked up for years in the Capitol's basement may soon shed light on the matter if they are released by President Obama—a move that's now expected, the AP reports. The papers detail the findings of a congressional inquiry into what foreign entities provided support to the 9/11 hijackers while they planned the attacks. Former Sen. Bob Graham, who helped lead that inquiry, notes a White House official told him intel officers are reviewing the docs.  The most important unanswered question of 9/11 is: Did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?  he said on Sunday's Meet the Press, adding he finds it  implausible  they could have carried out such a plan without outside aid, per the Hill.  All the evidence points to Saudi Arabia,  he said. Graham isn't alone: The 28pages.org website has been lobbying for the pages to be brought  out of the shadows,  while other lawmakers and some 9/11 victims' families are similarly quizzical regarding Saudi involvement. Then-President George W. Bush had ordered those pages stripped from the original 838-page report, warning that US intelligence secrets could be at risk. When asked how declassifying these pages would impact the strained relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, Graham said  7.838  on a scale of 1 to 10, per the New York Daily News—i.e., a  high-level negative impact,  as Chuck Todd put it. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, says it's been  wrongfully and morbidly accused of complicity  and that it wants those 28 pages publicized so it could  respond to any allegations in a clear and credible manner.  Graham says he expects an answer by June.",Obama May Release Top-Secret 9/11 Pages,Obama May Release Top-Secret ____ Pages,9/11,Copy( 9/11 ),0
"(Oct 15, 2012  9:51 AM CDT) Americans stepped up their retail spending in September, reflecting stronger sales of autos, electronics, and building supplies. Retail sales rose 1.1% last month, the Commerce Department said today. That followed a 1.2% increase in August, which was revised slightly higher. Both were the largest gains since October 2010. Sales rose in most major categories. Electronics and appliances surged 4.5%, in part because of the release of the new iPhone. Sales at auto dealers increased 1.3%. Building materials, garden supplies, furniture, and clothing sales all increased, too. Economists said the September increase should help drive slightly stronger growth in the July-September quarter. But they cautioned that some of the jump was driven by the release of the iPhone 5.  This shouldn't be considered the start of a consumer revival,  said one.  This is a one-time boost that will be reversed in the coming months.  Some of the increases were also driven by higher prices. Gas station sales also rose 2.5%, and food sales increased 1.2%. The recent drought may have driven some food prices higher, economists noted. Still, excluding autos and gas, sales were up a solid 0.9% in September.",US Retail Sales Jumped 1.1% in September,US Retail Sales Jumped ____% in September,1.1,Copy( 1.1 ),0

Abu Musab al-Suri, also known as Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, is also suspected of being connected to the 2004 Madrid train bombings and an attack on the Paris subway in 1995, setting up European sleeper cells, and running training camps in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden in the 1990s. Al-Suri was captured by the CIA in Pakistan in 2005 and was reportedly turned over to Syria, the country of his birth, six years ago as part of a controversial rendition program. But with violence in Syria reaching new levels over the weekend and the United States trying to get the UN Security Council to condemn the Assad government, al-Suri's release is a significant pushback by the Syrian government.

The light sits at the corner of Ziegelstraße street, and drivers have only one choice when they come to it—to turn  right on red  when it's safe to do so, explains the Local. Though the light is at the intersection of four streets, drivers are not allowed to go in any direction but right. Which raises the obvious question: Why not just put a stop sign there? That's where a Dresden official starts citing chapter and verse of local traffic regulations that don't seem to fully answer the common-sense question.  Stop signs do not correspond to traffic light systems and do not fulfill the same set of regulations,  is part of the answer. The upshot is that Dresden spends about $6,200 a year to maintain the light, which has added up to about $170,000 since it was installed in 1987, back when East Germany still existed. And the crazier part is that the city replaces the yellow and green bulbs too, notes Yahoo News.

Jose Ismael Torres, 26, will spend 13 years in prison for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, making terroristic threats, and violating the street gang act; Kayla Rae Norton, 25, is to serve six years for terroristic threats and violating the street gang act, reports the AP.

Both wept as the sentences were handed down. The two are the last of 15 people charged in the confrontation at the 8-year-old's party, which took place in Douglasville in July 2015, less than a month after white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine African Americans at a historic black church in Charleston, SC. Only four were charged with felonies. The other two pleaded guilty and are serving shorter prison terms. Torres and Norton were found guilty of yelling racial slurs and threatening to kill partygoers, even the kids. Prosecutors said Torres pointed a shotgun at the party.

According to the BBC, the zoo had come under fire in recent years over the condition of its animals and infrastructure. Of particular concern was the suffering of the zoo's polar bears during Buenos Aires' sweltering summers. The zoo's last remaining polar bear, Winner, died in part because of hot temperatures and poor conditions. And while the zoo was originally built on the edge of Buenos Aires, the city had grown around it, putting animals in close proximity to buildings and busy streets, the AP reports.  This situation of captivity is degrading for the animals, it’s not the way to take care of them,  Buenos Aires mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta said during a ceremony Thursday, per the Guardian. Most of the zoo's animals—sources have them numbering between 1,500 and 2,500—will be moved to animal sanctuaries in Argentina and elsewhere. About 50 animals too old or sick to move will stay behind, though not on public display. Among those animals is Sandra the orangutan, who made news two years ago when a court gave her rights as a  non-human person.

But that afternoon, what ABC15 describes as a  military-type vehicle  carrying nine family members from a holiday get-together tried to go over the barricaded creek, and three children are now missing after a flash flood overtook the vehicle.

In Niger, where the majority head, the lucky ones limp across a desolate 9-mile no man's land to the border village of Assamaka. Others wander for days before a UN rescue squad can find them.

As Consumerist reports, Prestigious Pets' original lawsuit, which sought less than $7,000, was quickly dropped—only to be replaced with this new suit, which seeks between $200,000 and $1 million. Prestigious Pets originally argued that Robert and Michelle Douchouquette violated a non-disparagement clause in the petsitting contract by posting the bad review, in which the couple complained about some of the company's policies and alleged the petsitter may have harmed their fish. The new suit still alleges the non-disparagement clause was violated, and adds two more claims: defamation and business disparagement. Prestigious Pets says the bad review and the ensuing bad publicity have led to threats and harassment and left the company a  shell of its former success,  CBS DFW reports.

As LiveScience reports, there's long been doubt cast on Byrd's 15-hour, 44-minute flight from Spitsbergen, Norway, which had been expected to take 18 hours. So retired Ohio State astronomy professor Gerald Newsom waded into Byrd's own navigation notes, which he found wanting.

So while Newsom's findings suggest Byrd undershot the Pole, he thinks it was a result of poor technology rather than ill intentions: Working in a freezing cockpit, Byrd relied on a solar compass, tracked atmospheric pressure with a tiny barograph, and measured speed with a stopwatch—via an opening in the plane's bottom. All while trying to avoid crashing and frostbite. Newsom says that Byrd likely saw the North Pole, given that his altitude provided 90-mile-long visibility, but the real record would belong to Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian who made the trip just days after Byrd.

"(Jun 1, 2017  9:02 AM CDT) Nearly 40 years ago, a respected doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine with good news: Out of nearly 40,000 patients given powerful pain drugs, only four addictions were documented. Doctors had been wary of opioids, but reassured by the letter, which called addiction  rare  in those with no history of addiction, they spread the good news in their own published reports. And that's how a one-paragraph letter with no supporting information helped seed a nationwide epidemic of misuse of drugs like Vicodin and OxyContin, the AP reports. On Wednesday, the journal published an editor's note about the 1980 letter and analysis from Canadian researchers of how often it has been cited—more than 600 times, often inaccurately. Most used it as evidence that addiction was rare and didn't say it only concerned hospitalized patients, not outpatient or chronic pain situations.  It's difficult to overstate the role of this letter,  says the University of Toronto's Dr. David Juurlink, who led the analysis. Hospital databases were so limited in 1980 that there could have been more problems, or cases discovered after patients were discharged, he adds. The letter was written by Dr. Hershel Jick, a drug specialist at Boston University Medical Center, and a grad student.  I'm essentially mortified that that letter to the editor was used as an excuse to do what these drug companies did,  Jick says. He also notes he testified as a government witness in a lawsuit years ago over the marketing of pain drugs. The new editor's note says:  For reasons of public health, readers should be aware that this letter has been 'heavily and uncritically cited' as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.  The journal also published a report pledging to develop new ways to reverse and prevent overdoses, treat addiction, and find novel, non-addictive drugs for chronic pain.",The Letter From 37 Years Ago That Spurred the Opioid Crisis,The Letter From ____ Years Ago That Spurred the Opioid Crisis,37,"Subtract( 2017 , 1980 )",1

It’s a troubling situation, ethics experts tell Politico, because though the law provides all those perks for five years after a speaker leaves office, it also prohibits federal money from paying for lobbying operations. In other words, Hastert can have the perks legally, as long as he doesn’t use any of them for his lobbying work.  That all needs to be above board, in the clear and transparent,  says one government watchdog,  And it’s not.

Legislator Adrian Rurawhe explains the concept is normal to the Maori and best captured in the tribal saying,  I am the river and the river is me.  He tells the New Zealand Herald that maybe the rest of the world is finally catching up with the Maori and  seeing things the way that we see them.  Still think it's, well, bizarre?

The state's all-Republican Supreme Court overruled lower courts today and deemed the so-called  pole tax  constitutional, the AP reports. The fee has been levied since 2007 on clubs that both serve booze and present nude dancing; the money, which has been stashed in a state account pending the outcome of the legal challenges, is to be used for sexual assault prevention programs and health care for the uninsured. In overruling the lower courts' decisions, the state Supreme Court judges deemed $5 too small to be considered a restriction on the free expression of nude dancing. They also said the state has an interest in curbing the established link between booze, live nude girls, and sexual violence.  Remove the alcohol, avoid the fee,  said an attorney who argued the case for the state.  Today's ruling is a big win for victims of sexual assault.

The report, by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, is likely to slam executives over a failure to adequately alert regulators and investors as the bank made big bets. Executives like former CFO Douglas Braunstein could be asked to testify this month, insiders tell the New York Times. The report, due out March 15, emphasizes the role of executives, rather than traders, in the $6 billion loss; indeed, emails indicate the  Whale  himself raised flags about the risky trades. With many associated executives now departed from the bank, Braunstein and CEO Jamie Dimon could take the brunt of the heat.

He kicked off the push by hosting two dozen of them, many longtime donors, at the White House weeks before announcing his campaign to talk regulation, the deficit, and economic recovery. And, in a move at least one financier finds ironic, he will soon host more bankers, execs, and investors at posh New York restaurant Daniel, where the six-course meal runs $195 per  fat cat.  Obama's campaign manager and other supporters have also been meeting with Wall Street donors as part of Obama’s effort to win them back. To do so, he must convince them that his policies have actually helped to speed the recovery of banks and financial markets. But Wall Street is still unhappy about the president’s efforts to tighten regulation, and many of his past donors are still sitting on the sidelines at this point. Some of those are Republicans who supported him in 2008 as a post-partisan candidate but no longer see him the same way.

Swann Galleries says the circa late-1860s image sold Thursday for a hammer price of $130,000, plus a $32,500 auctioneer fee, the AP reports.

The Tubman photo, which Swann specialist Wyatt Day tells Reuters is  remarkable,  shows her seated on a chair and was taken in Auburn in central New York in 1868 or 1869. What makes it unique is that the photo was taken when Tubman was in her 40s, unlike most other pictures that show her when she's much older.  This is what she looked like in her prime Civil War period when she was working as a spy for Lincoln,  Day notes.

Arthur strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane yesterday, making landfall at 11:15pm EST with 100mph winds—if it had been a little later, it would have been the first hurricane ever to make landfall on July 4. But it didn't stay long. North Carolina officials reported few issues this morning, as the National Weather Service declared Arthur had moved off land and over the Atlantic by sun-up, tracking a path over the water that runs parallel to New England's coast. At its most severe point, some 21,000 North Carolina customers were without power. Fireworks shows in New Jersey, Maine, and New Hampshire have been delayed until later in the weekend because of the storm, while Boston held its annual Boston Pops Fourth of July concert and fireworks show a day early, the AP reports.

Phantom  is a black-and-white version of the Australian photographer's  Ghost,  which for a time sat in a nature photography exhibit at the Smithsonian. The Arizona Republic reports the photo shows a shaft of light penetrating an underground cavern in Arizona's Antelope Canyon.  Phantom  sold alongside photographs  Illusion  for $2.4 million and  Eternal Moods  for $1.1 million, which, according to a press release, means Lik has now sold four of the top 20 most expensive photographs ever—a fact that seems to amaze art critics, who have never been particularly taken with Lik's work.  If this is the most valuable 'fine art photograph' in history, God help fine art photography,  Jonathan Jones writes at the Guardian, arguing the photo  typifies everything that goes wrong when photographers think they are artists.  A lawyer for the buyer says his client has chosen to remain anonymous, but  someone has been very foolish with their money,  Jones says. Given such criticism, it's perhaps surprising that the Washington Post reports Lik isn't one to be modest. His website describes  Phantom  as a  masterwork  and Lik himself as  a true leader in the world of fine art.

Researchers at the University of Utah gave mice a diet of 25% sugar—equivalent to three extra sodas per day in people—and found the males less likely to reproduce or defend their territory, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Females had it worse, dying at double their normal rate. And to think, the National Research Council tells us that this level of added sugar is considered safe in humans.  Added sugar consumed at concentrations currently considered safe exerts dramatic adverse impacts on mammalian health,  the study says, according to Science Daily. Yet the mice weren't fatter and would have passed physicals, despite the negative health impacts—so the sugar's toxic damage is all  under the hood.  Why rely on a study of mice?

The New York surgeon's daughter confirmed his Oct. 4 death at a care facility in Warren, NJ, to the New York Times, which notes the roster of famous people who found themselves under Thorbjarnarson's care, including Warhol, Johnny Carson, and Reza Pahlavi, the late Shah of Iran.

At a virtual fundraising event Wednesday night, Biden said the campaign took in a total of $26 million in the 24 hours after the announcement, including donations from 150,000 first-time donors, Politico reports.  It's really palpable, the excitement, because there's so much at stake,  Biden said, per CNN. President Trump and the RNC raised $165 million in July, compared to $140 million for Biden and the DNC, though in terms of total cash on hand, Biden ended July just $6 million behind Trump at $294 million.

Biden's lead over Trump was largely unchanged by the Harris pick, according to a Reuters poll, which found a 1-point increase to 8 points, within the poll's margin of error.

Some 25% of Republicans polled said they had a favorable view of Harris, compared to 20% for Biden. An ABC/Ipsos poll released Thursday found that some 35% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Harris and 31% view her unfavorably, giving her a net favorability rating of +4.

He was better known as  Baby-Doc  Duvalier, so named because his father—a doctor-turned-dictator—was  Papa Doc.  The regimes of both leaders tortured and killed political opponents and relied on a dreaded civilian militia known as the Tonton Macoutes. Jean-Claude took over from his deceased father in 1971 at age 19, becoming the world's youngest president. He ruled for 15 years, with his administration seen as less violent and repressive than his father's. Echoes of press freedom and personal criticism, never tolerated under his father, emerged—sporadically—because of international pressure. Still, human rights groups documented abuses and political persecution. And as the New York Times puts it, Duvalier  dominated the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere through a combination of brutality, intimidation and guile.  Under mounting pressure from the administration of US President Jimmy Carter, Duvalier made pretenses of improving the country's human rights record by releasing political prisoners. Still, journalists and activists were jailed or exiled. Haitians without visas or money left by boarding flimsy boats in a desperate effort to reach Florida shores. As Haiti's living conditions deteriorated, Pope John-Paul II made a visit in 1983 and famously declared:  Things must change.  Three years later, they did.

Reuters and the South China Morning Post report that UK judge Charles Haddon-Cave has ordered Russian oligarch Farkhad Akhmedov to sign over the 380-foot Luna to his 41-year-old wife as part of a $635 million divorce settlement Cave awarded her in 2016—nearly 42% of Akhmedov's fortune, and said to be the largest British divorce settlement of all time. (The couple moved from Russia to London in 1993, where Akhmedova has lived ever since and raised their two sons.) And it's some boat Akhmedova will soon be docking: a nine-deck expedition yacht with 50 crew members, two helipads, a 65-foot swimming pool, a mini-submarine, and even an anti-missile system. The new court order comes after Akhmedova says she never received any money from the settlement, with Cave noting it appeared the 62-year-old Akhmedov had taken  elaborate steps to conceal his wealth and evade enforcement of the judgment,  per the London Times. Akhmedov said he'd sold the yacht back in 2014, but it turned out the firm he'd sold it to was simply one of his own offshore companies, and Akhmedova's attorneys eventually tracked the yacht down in dry dock in Dubai, where it remains under court order.

The torch was doused for the first time near the start of the route at the Eiffel Tower and taken on board the bus that accompanies the runners, the AP reports. Officials re-lit it farther along the route, only to douse it again four more times before finally cutting short the relay. Despite 3,000 officers providing security on motorcycles, in jogging gear and on roller blades, at least two human-rights protesters got within almost an arm’s length of the flame before they were grabbed by police.

Police Chief Nick Willard says the two officers were shot at separate locations after 2am, and they're recovering at hospitals and expected to be OK, the AP reports. Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas says the officers  seem to be fine.  There was no other immediate word on the extent of the officers' injuries, and no details about the shootings have been released. Floyd Johnson lives near one of the shooting sites on Manchester's west side. He says he awoke to the sound of multiple gunshots at about 2:15am. Seconds later,  all the police swarmed in,  Johnson says. He said he told his 13-year-old son to get on the floor. Police also told Johnson to stay put, away from the windows. Johnson says he's lived on the west side all his life, and he's never seen anything like this before. Willard says police are searching for the suspected shooter, described as a white man with long hair who's wearing a trenchcoat. He is considered armed and dangerous.

"(Nov 6, 2016  11:01 AM) An effort to reinvent Nigeria's overloaded transportation infrastructure is running into opposition from environmental groups, the Smithsonian reports. Conservation groups say a proposed 162-mile superhighway through Nigeria's southern Cross River State will have severe repercussions on more than half of the country's remaining rainforests, and the project will also dislocate populations of both people and animals, including around a million people and some communities of critically endangered lowland gorillas. Activists are calling out the superhighway project's developers because they're seeking a 12-mile right-of-way allowance on either side of the highway, Quartz reports; the usual right-of-way is only 50 meters.  This project will take a quarter of the land in the state,  says one activist.  It is a pure land grab.  The superhighway project is part of the Nigerian government's efforts to address the shoddy state of the country's roads, which are poorly maintained and see some of the worst gridlock in the world. The highway was approved by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari more than a year ago, but it then emerged that an Environment Impact Assessment hadn't been done. Environmentalists managed to get construction halted while the EIA was performed. The final draft of the EIA was submitted on November 1, although activists say it's a sham. A spokesperson for the Cross River State government said:  Is it that we don’t need infrastructure? The forest you are protecting, who owns the forest? The forest is ours.

The vets were given insulin injections that led to fatal blood sugar crashes; the victims were largely either not diabetic, or not in need of insulin. Reta Mays, 46, was arrested after authorities noticed an  unusual  number of deaths from severe hypoglycemia in the area between July 2017 and June 2018, NBC News reports.  She denied it for a long time until most recently when she finally recognized the strength of our case,  a US attorney says. No motive has become clear, but the Washington Post reports that at the hearing Tuesday, Mays, an Army National Guard veteran who was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait in the early 2000s, told the judge she was on medication for post-traumatic stress disorder. She was hired at Louis A. Johnson Medical Center in Clarksburg in 2015 and fired last year, seven months after being removed from patient care. With her position on the night shift, few saw her at work.

"(Jan 17, 2017  5:58 PM) Two sisters have been found, 32 years after they were reported missing. Police say their mother, Elaine Yates, took Kimberly and Kelly Yates from Rhode Island in 1985 amid a custody dispute when they were 3 years old and 10 months old, respectively. Acting on an anonymous tip, police located the trio in the Houston area. Elaine Yates was arrested Monday and is facing child-snatching charges, WCVB reports. The girls' father, Russell Yates, says he's not interested in seeing her prosecuted because  that ain't gonna help her, me, or anybody else at this point,  but says he hopes to see his daughters soon. Heavy and the Providence Journal have background on the complicated case: Three weeks prior to her disappearance, Elaine Yates reportedly found her husband with another woman on the family boat. He later acknowledged hitting Elaine during a fight about the incident, though he said she attacked him first. Russell Yates was awarded custody when Elaine failed to appear at the custody hearing held months after her disappearance with the children. The year after their disappearance, Russell Yates sued Elaine's mother, believing she knew where they were; the woman ultimately did not give up any information and spent eight days in jail as a result. Russell and Elaine Yates were formally divorced in 1996. The Journal recently re-posted an extensive 1988 article on the case.

"(Sep 19, 2011  6:59 PM CDT) A federal appeals court voted 2-1 today to throw out the 17-year sentence handed to alleged  dirty bomber  Jose Padilla, saying that it was too low given his criminal history and the threat he poses.  Padilla’s sentence of 12 years below the low end of the Guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment,  the majority wrote in their ruling, according to ABC News.  Padilla poses a heightened risk of future dangerousness due to his al-Qaeda training.  The dissenting judge said she disagreed, because overturning the sentence  simply substitutes this Court’s sentencing judgment for that of the trial judge, in whom that authority inheres.  When Padilla was arrested in 2002, John Ashcroft accused him of plotting to blow up a dirty bomb, but when he was eventually brought to trial in civilian court, there was no mention of a bomb—he was merely accused of being part of a cell that funneled recruits and cash to al-Qaeda and other terrorists.

"(Apr 30, 2018  4:16 PM CDT) The Good Samaritan still exists or, at least, his people do. The religious sect adheres to the word of God as written by Moses—they still slaughter sheep on Passover, for instance—and was once 1 million people strong. The current count has them down to 810 members, who straddle both Palestinian and Israeli territory. The crime that Daniel Estrin documents for NPR happened in the former, in the city of Nablus in the early hours of March 21, 1995: a Torah and a codex were stolen from a synagogue,  perhaps the most ancient Torahs stolen in the Holy Land since the Crusaders pillaged Jerusalem.  And thus began a convoluted international quest to bring them home. Estrin met Benyamim  Benny  Tsedaka, a 125th-generation Samaritan who has been following leads in the case. First came word that men in Jordan had the documents and wanted a $7 million ransom, then $2 million. It went nowhere. Then there was the  Dealer,  who in 2011 received video files showing the documents; two years later, Estrin went with him to Amman to rendez-vous with the thieves' frontman. There, the story shifted: One scroll was now allegedly in Syria; a rumor placed the other in London. But a trip to London, complete with a hopeful visit to a diamond magnate, brought another dead end. Then came some twists: One Samaritan Estrin met with pointed out that the thief knew where the key to the ark was kept, and was able to remove one scroll from a copper case that was left behind—things, he suggested, only Samaritans who hailed from a priestly family could do. Were Samaritans behind the theft? Estrin still isn't sure. But he does know they'll never get the Torahs back in one piece.

When no one answered Rodney Scott's door five minutes later, they put their plan into action, breaking in through a side entrance. Unbeknownst to the intruders, Scott, who had been sleeping upstairs, grabbed his handgun. Layman soon watched as his friend, 21-year-old Danzele Johnson, fell to the ground with a bullet in his chest. Hours later, police told Layman he was being charged with felony murder.  I was shellshocked,  Layman tells the Guardian.  How could it be murder when I didn't kill anyone?  The  Elkhart Four,  who ranged in age from 16 to 18, were tried as adults. One was given 45 years in prison in a plea deal; the three others were found guilty of felony murder and received 55 years in a case now under review by the Indiana supreme court. Some 46 states have some form of felony murder law; 11 of those states allow anyone who commits a felony that results in a death to be charged with murder. Indiana's slightly more ambiguous law says a  person who kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit … burglary … commits murder, a felony.  Lawyers for Layman, who was shot in the leg during the break-in, argue that wording  requires the defendant or one of his accomplices to do the killing. In Blake's case neither he nor any of his co-perpetrators killed anybody.  Layman acknowledges,  I made a bad choice, and I gladly take responsibility for it.  But  I'm not a killer.  He adds,  I just want a chance to live  and will  go to work every day, and come home to my wife and kids ... I don't ask for much.

"(Sep 27, 2018  2:09 PM CDT) A tragic end to the story of the 6-year-old North Carolina boy who went missing while visiting a park with his father Saturday: Authorities say they have found a body believed to be that of Maddox Scott Ritch. A neighbor tells FOX 46 Charlotte that local residents asked whether search teams had looked in one particular area near Rankin Lake Park yet; when crews started searching that area Thursday, a body was found around 1pm. Ian Ritch said he and a friend, who has not been publicly identified, were visiting the park for the first time with Maddox, who has autism and is non-verbal, when the boy took off running; Ian Ritch said he is diabetic and has neuropathy in his feet, leaving him unable to keep up with the boy. He, the friend, and park personnel searched for the boy for an hour before calling 911. At a press conference, the local police chief said the community is  heartbroken,  and Fire Chief Phil Welch added, per the AP,  There is no sense of accomplishment here today. There is grieving down at our command post.  Welch said a searcher found the body in a creek just over a mile east of the park; the area had been searched previously, but on Thursday a searcher who was walking down the middle of the creek found the body in no more than 3-foot-deep water. An FBI agent said it's too early to tell whether there was any foul play, and none of the officials revealed details including how long the body had been in the creek.",Body Believed to Be Missing 6-Year-Old Found,Body Believed to Be Missing ____-Year-Old Found,6,Copy( 6 ),0

An editor said the paper is looking into whether the reporter violated the Post's social media policy, NBC reports.  The tweets displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues,  Tracy Grant said. After the outcry erupted, Felicai Sonmez wrote,  Any public figure is worth remembering in their totality, even if that public figure beloved and that totality upsetting.  The Daily Beast article she tweeted about the 2003 allegation carried the headline,  Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser’s Story, and the Half-Confession.  Sonmez deleted the tweet but posted a screenshot of what she said were 10,000 pieces of  abuse and death threats  she'd received, per the New York Post. That tweet also has been deleted.

"(Nov 29, 2017  3:44 PM) What goes up must come down. CNBC reports that bitcoin passed the $11,000 mark for the first time Wednesday just hours after surpassing $10,000 for the first time. Wednesday was the sixth day in a row the cryptocurrency hit a record high, increasing its value 15%, according to Reuters. But later Wednesday, the value of a bitcoin plummeted to as low as $9,300, the AP reports. Regardless, that's still a massive increase over the $1,000 value of a bitcoin at the start of the year. And the CEO of CryptoCompare tells Business Insider the passing of $10,000 was a  seminal moment  for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is now worth more than $330 billion total. The recent meteoric rise of bitcoin has brought increasing warnings of a bubble set to burst.  Even if you believe in bitcoin, the velocity of the move is a sign that it is parabolic,  CNBC's Jim Cramer says.  And parabolic moves don't last.  It appears few people are actually using bitcoin as currency, instead stockpiling it in hopes of increasing their capital.  What’s happening right now has nothing to do with bitcoin’s functionality as a currency—this is pure mania that’s taken hold,  research fellow Garrick Hileman tells Reuters. Hileman says  people need to be very careful  about the coming burst. But it appears few are heeding his message.

Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt.

And now the North Dakota 18-year-old is putting the future she planned for—cosmetology school—on hold, replacing it with a new goal: to become the legal guardian of her sister Meagan, 16, and brother Spencer, 14. The Jackson siblings had a difficult upbringing: Mom Rebecca started doing meth when MacKenzie was little, both parents were in poor health, and a couple months before dad Cory died, Meagan and Spencer were put into foster care.  The conditions of my house weren't good for them to be in and my dad was drinking a lot,  MacKenzie tells People.  But it was only after my dad died that I knew I was now going to be in charge of getting them back.  She had already been taking care of her siblings since their mother's death, taking on responsibilities like grocery shopping and making sure the younger kids made it to school, doctor's appointments, and other things, all while keeping her own grades up. After her dad's death, she called social services and began working to become their legal guardian; she also moved out of the house they had been living in.

Plaintiff Nicholas Murray, 26, alleged that J&J failed to adequately warn doctors of the risks of the drug, which he took for a 5-year period beginning at age 9, reports the Washington Post. Compensatory damages for Murray amounting to $680,000 had previously been awarded in 2016.

"(Jul 3, 2010  7:22 AM CDT) President Richard Nixon's inner circle worried about the effects of global warming more than 30 years ago, according to documents released by his library yesterday. Future Democratic star Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1969 urged a global system of monitoring carbon dioxide, and worried that CO2 would rise 25% by 2000.  This could increase the average temperature near the earth's surface by 7 degrees Fahrenheit,  he wrote.  This in turn could raise the level of the sea by 10 feet. Goodbye New York. Goodbye Washington, for that matter.  Moynihan received a response in a January 26, 1970 memo from Hubert Heffner, deputy director of the administration's Office of Science and Technology. Heffner acknowledged that atmospheric temperature rise was an issue that should be looked at.  The more I get into this, the more I find two classes of doomsayers,  he wrote.  One group says we will turn into snow-tripping mastodons because of the atmospheric dust and the other says we will have to grow gills to survive the increased ocean level due to the temperature rise.

After sifting through 750 sacks of human excrement discovered in the sewers below the town of Herculaneum, scientists have deduced that Romans ate a lot of vegetables, sea urchins, fish, figs, olives, and eggs, report the BBC and Daily Mail. The waste also had a high white blood cell count, indicating a bacterial infection.  We can find out such a lot about what Romans ate by sifting through the poo and in essence it is the classic Mediterranean Diet, plenty of fish and fruit,  says one of the leading researchers.

The Craven County Sheriff's Office says Casey was found in good health Thursday by a professional search and rescue crew, USA Today reports. He was taken to East Carolina Medical Center for evaluation. The boy, who was not dressed for cold weather, disappeared in terrain that the sheriff's office described as treacherous.  Areas are flooded and filled with sinkholes, even the trained searchers are having trouble navigating safely,  the sheriff's office said earlier Thursday, as strong winds and rain hampered the search. Casey was found around 50 yards into the woods, tangled in briars, when searchers, who had been acting on a tip, heard him calling for his mother. Authorities believed he moved around during the time he was missing.  He was cold but he was verbal in command to us. The more we warmed him up, the more active he became,  rescuer Shane Greer tells WRAL.  For the conditions, I think he fared pretty well.  The boy's parents hugged rescuers Thursday night and thanked everybody involved in the search.

The Illinois man tells the News-Gazette and WCIA that all SSA employees were informed by email in April that they'd need to individually watch the video and then sign a paper verifying they had done so; Hall, who says the video clashes with his Christian belief that homosexuality is a sin, didn't, even after his supervisor instructed him to do so on June 2 and 24.

Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting explains: San Diego man Osbaldo Padron claims he was sexually abused as a child in the 1990s by an adult congregation member and filed suit against the Jehovah's Witnesses for not interceding and continuing to promote the man. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports the church allegedly knew in 1982 that Gonzalo Campos had molested a child; Campos later admitted to abusing at least eight kids between that year and 1995 (he fled to Mexico in 2010). Padron wants internal documents that he believes show a pattern, and the church won't hand them over, in violation of a court order. Hence the $4,000 daily penalty; the order was upheld on appeal last week.

New York City was rocked by the sensational crime, in which a young woman jogging alone in Central Park at night was bludgeoned, raped, tied up and left for dead. Five teenage boys—four black and one Latino—confessed to the crime after two days under intense police interrogation during which they say they were denied sleep and food, although each person accused another of the actual rape. Trump inserted himself into the conversation two weeks after the attack by buying full-page ads in several New York papers. The ads didn't address the controversy directly, but it was pretty obvious what Trump was talking about when he called for the city to  BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY  in big, bold type. In 2002, a separate man confessed to the crime, and his DNA was matched to semen found at the scene. No DNA evidence linking the teens to the crime was ever found. The  Central Park 5  were exonerated by the legal system, and in 2014, the city of New York paid the group $41 million to settle the case—a settlement Trump called a  disgrace.  He repeatedly refused to apologize for his stance, and just this week, Trump doubled down on his decades-old conviction. In a statement to CNN (which ThinkProgress notes he offered up because CNN was doing a retrospective on the case) he said,  They admitted they were guilty. The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous.

To do so, they would would need a net gain of six seats. It sounds steep, but Max Baucus recently became the sixth Democrat to announce his retirement, compared with only two Republicans.

A global problem with Apple's iTunes servers prevented the phones from being activated in-store, as planned. Employees implored buyers to perform the last step on their own computers, but  iTunes servers were equally hard to reach from home, leaving the phones unusable except for emergency calls.  It's such grief and aggravation,  said Frederick Smalls, an insurance broker in Whitman, Mass., after spending two hours on the phone with Apple and AT&T.

Auditor Shad White said his office received $500,000 from Favre on Wednesday, plus a commitment that Favre will repay the other $600,000 in installments over the next few months, the AP reports. Favre's effort to repay the money came two days after White released an audit of spending by the Mississippi Department of Human Services that showed Favre had been paid by Mississippi Community Education Center, a nonprofit group whose former leader has been indicted in a welfare embezzlement scheme. The center had contracts with Human Services to spend money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, also known as TANF. In an audit, White said his employees identified $94 million in questionable spending by the agency, including payments for sports activities with no clear connection to helping needy people in one of the poorest states of the US. The audit released Monday said the center paid Favre Enterprises $500,000 in December 2017 and $600,000 in June 2018, and he was supposed to make speeches for at least three events. The auditor’s report said that  upon a cursory review of those dates, auditors were able to determine that the individual contracted did not speak nor was he present for those events.  In a Facebook post Wednesday night, Favre said he didn’t know the payments he received came from welfare funds and noted his charity had provided millions of dollars to poor kids in his home state of Mississippi and Wisconsin, where he played the bulk of his Hall of Fame career with the Green Bay Packers.",Brett Favre to Repay $1.1M in Welfare Scandal,Brett Favre to Repay $____M in Welfare Scandal,1.1,Copy( 1.1 ),0

The sheriff tells CNN that the only people authorized to take photos of the scene were the coroner's office and the National Transportation Safety Board.  Anybody outside of that would be unauthorized, they would be illicit photos,  says Villanueva, who launched an investigation after the Los Angeles Times reported that deputies had been sharing photos of the scene and the victims' remains. He says police also receive a complaint from a citizen who said a trainee deputy had been showing the images in a bar. Villaneuva says the deputies were ordered to delete the photos.  That was my No. 1 priority, was to make sure those photos no longer exist,  the sheriff tells NBC Los Angeles.  We identified the deputies involved, they came to the station on their own and had admitted they had taken them and they had deleted them. And, we're content that those involved did that.  He says the deputies will face administrative action but he believes that if he had gone with the  usual routine  of relieving them of duty, it would have greatly increased the chances of the images becoming public.

"(Nov 25, 2017  1:35 PM) After four decades of work, researchers published the origin of Big Bird (not that one) in Science this week—and it's scientifically unprecedented. The BBC reports that for the first time ever, researchers were able to watch the rise of a new species play out in nature.  It's an extreme case of something we're coming to realize,  a speciation expert says.  Evolution in general can happen very quickly.  According to a press release, in 1981 an interloper arrived on Daphne Major, a tiny island in the Galapagos archipelago where Peter and B. Rosemary Grant were studying Darwin's finches. The new bird, bigger than the three species living on the island, was a large cactus finch that had apparently flown from an island more than 60 miles away. Unable to return, it mated with a local medium ground finch. The resulting offspring, nicknamed the Big Bird lineage for their size, were unable to attract partners from the local finch population due to their weird song and unusual beak size and mated only among themselves. B. Rosemary Grant calls it a  terrifically inbred lineage,  Science Alert reports. Within just two generations, the Big Birds were a distinct species, as confirmed by genomic sequencing and their own unique physical characteristics. An expert says if a naturalist came to the island today, they would simply believe there were four native finch species with nothing giving away the Big Bird as a recent addition. It was touch-and-go there for a minute—droughts in 2002 and 2003 killed all but two Big Birds—but there are now 30 or so members of the hybrid species living on Daphne Major.

"(Jul 3, 2015  3:51 AM CDT) One of America's ritziest restaurants has been ordered to give around 70 servers a total $500,000 for engaging in what New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman calls some pretty lowly behavior: cheating servers out of their tips. The AG's office says Manhattan restaurant Per Se, which charges $310 for its  tasting menu,  slapped a 20%  service charge  on the bills of private-dining client customers and, in violation of state law, used that money for general operational costs instead of giving it directly to the servers, the New York Daily News reports. The restaurant was also fined $100,000 and will be required to step up compliance with labor laws, reports the New York Times. The settlement ensures that servers  will not continue to be cheated out of their hard-earned tips—tips that customers intended for them,  Schneiderman said. In a statement to CNBC, the restaurant says the failure to pay the charge to servers was an oversight after state regulations on service charges changed in 2011. Per Se says workers were  never short-changed and no monies intended for employees were withheld,  and the charge helped pay for  industry-leading wages  that average $116,000 a year for a waiter, including overtime and tips.

"(May 13, 2020  5:45 PM CDT) Children have made up only a small fraction of those hospitalized with COVID-19—but experts say the coronavirus can affect them in unexpected ways and it is a mistake to think of them as immune. According to a recent study looking at five children under 6 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, four of them had digestive tract problems, including diarrhea and vomiting, as the first symptoms, LiveScience reports.  Most children are only mildly affected by COVID-19 and the few severe cases often have underlying health issues,  said the lead author, Dr. Wenbin Li.  It is easy to miss its diagnosis in the early stage, when a child has non-respiratory symptoms or suffers from another illness.  He suspects the children were infected via the digestive tract. Doctors say they are also concerned by the rise in cases in the US and worldwide of children being hospitalized with a dangerous inflammatory syndrome. Researchers believe the mysterious syndrome is linked to COVID-19. During his testimony before a Senate panel Tuesday, Anthony Fauci said we should not be  cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.  He was responding to Sen. Rand Paul, who said it was  ridiculous  to suggest schools might have to stay closed this fall.

Holly Hoyle O'Brien was adopted by an American family in 1978 at the age of 9, the AP notes, a few years after her father died and her stepmother had fled with her younger half-sister. While O'Brien was growing up in Virginia, younger sister Meagan Hughes also was orphaned and was adopted by a family from Kingston, NY.

"(Jan 15, 2013  9:13 AM) US consumers increased their spending at retail businesses in December, buying more autos, furniture, and clothing. Steady job growth and lower gas prices kept consumers shopping for the holidays, despite worries about potential tax increases. The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose 0.5% in December from November, slightly better than November's 0.4% increase and the best showing since September. Car companies closed out their best sales year since 2007, leading all categories with a 1.6% sales jump. Total retail spending was even stronger when factoring out a drop in gas prices; exclude that, and they increased 0.8%. The retail sales report is the government's first look at consumer spending, which drives roughly 70% of economic activity. Earlier this month, major retailers reported that a last-minute surge in spending helped salvage the crucial holiday shopping season, which often accounts for as much as 40% of their annual revenue.",US Retail Sales Rise 0.5%,US Retail Sales Rise ____%,0.5,Copy( 0.5 ),0

"(Aug 25, 2012  4:37 PM CDT) Think Todd Akin's comments about  legitimate rape  were medieval? Even scarier, and less-discussed, is the fact that many US states allow alleged rapists to apply for parental rights of children conceived by sexual assault, write Dana Liebelson and Sydney Brownstone at Mother Jones.  It sounds unfathomable,  they write, but rapists can  assert their parental rights and use custody proceedings as a weapon against their victims.  At least 27 states, including Arizona, Minnesota, New York, and Mississippi, offer no protection for mothers of children conceived by rape. Some states, like Maryland and Missouri, were shocked to find no rule in the books and managed to pass laws. Other states have partial laws, like protecting the mother if her rapist is convicted.  Part of the problem is that many rapes go unprosecuted,  write Libelson and Brownstone.  Only 9 out of every 100 rapes are prosecuted and just 5 lead to a felony conviction,  according to one count.

Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm have both publicly supported 8-year-old Mili Hernandez after her story went viral, the AP reports. Hernandez plays for the Azzuri-Cachorros Chicas in Omaha, Neb., and her team was disqualified Sunday after playing in the earlier part of the Springfield Soccer Association girls' tournament—because, her family claims to WOWT, organizers thought Hernandez, whose hair is short, was a boy. The family says they went so far as to show Hernandez's insurance card, with her gender listed, to organizers, but they wouldn't budge.

The students arrived at school wearing the Confederate flag on their clothes and refused to change to comply with school policy, which prohibits signs, decals, and articles of clothing  that reflect adversely on people because of race, gender, or other factors,  per the AP. A Montgomery County Public Schools rep tells WSLS the students were given one-day in-school suspensions, but most became unruly and were then handed an out-of-school punishment instead. The News Messenger reports a group of students, which school officials said numbered 22 or 23, was seen standing together in the school’s parking lot wearing Confederate flag apparel around 7:30am. A witness says they didn't appear to be protesting as they had no signs and weren't shouting any slogans. WSLS notes a recently adopted policy at the school requires students to sign a declaration that they will not put Confederate flag decals on their vehicles before they are issued a parking pass.

"(Jun 9, 2016  9:27 AM CDT) Donald Middleton of Texas has been gathering DWI convictions since Ronald Reagan was first elected president, and with nine to his name, he's now been sent to prison for life, per the Houston Chronicle. Montgomery County Judge Kathleen Hamilton issued the sentence to the 56-year-old Houston man on Tuesday after he had pleaded guilty last week to the ninth DWI, a May 2015 accident in which he smashed into a car driven by the 16-year-old son of Montgomery County cop Rowdy Hayden, CBS News reports. After the crash, Middleton—who authorities say veered out of his lane while trying to make a turn at a stop sign—reportedly fled the scene and tried to get a convenience store clerk to hide him; his BAC was said to be 0.184, more than double the legal limit, per the Montgomery County Police Reporter. He's already spent four other stints in prison for alcohol-related convictions, and KTRK documents all of his other DWI charges, starting with his first in 1980 when he was 20, per Harris County court documents. The MCPR notes Middleton testified during the punishment phase of his trial on Tuesday and said he had been teased in school and started drinking when he was a high school freshman. His sister says their dad had been a drinker until the night he met their mom (and then never touched a drop again). And Middleton's girlfriend even took the stand, noting she thought he could be rehabilitated and that he could easily give up driving because he didn't like it anyway. But the judge was obviously swayed by Middleton's apparent lack of remorse for hitting Joshua Hayden (who survived), as well as for his prior DWIs, and issued the life sentence. Rowdy Hayden thinks Middleton's sentence is more than appropriate.  For a habitual offender like this, he's proven that he cannot be rehabilitated,  he tells KTRK.  And he should spend the rest of his life in prison.

The ransom demand followed an escape attempt by Richard Phillips, who attempted to swim for safety early this morning. Reports conflict on what happened next—either a pirate jumped in after him and hauled him back, or Phillips returned after one of the captors fired an automatic weapon. After the escape attempt, the pirates dumped a two-way radio and a satellite phone Phillips was using to communicate with the Navy into the ocean. The standoff appears likely to continue. Fellow pirates are sailing other seized ships toward the lifeboat, hoping to somehow help the bandits get to land to improve their odds of escape.

With deliberations passing the 50-hour mark, longer than the testimony of all the witnesses combined, the 79-year-old TV star's lawyer complained that jurors were seeking a replay of the entire trial. Lawyer Brian McMonagle also worried that some jurors might compromise  their views and their values  for the sake of reaching a unanimous decision.  I believe this jury is tired, is weary,  McMonagle said late Friday, as the jury wrapped up yet another marathon round of deliberations. Judge Steven O'Neill pushed back on repeated defense requests for a mistrial, declaring that jurors could talk as long as they wanted over allegations that Cosby drugged and molested a woman at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004. The judge had instructed the panel to keep deliberating after it reported Thursday it was deadlocked on the charges against the comedian.  I'm sorry it's causing everyone frustration, but the law requires that I allow a deliberating jury to continue to deliberate,  the judge said. Yet even he had his limits, putting his foot down Friday when the jurors asked to hear a sliver of testimony they'd just had read back to them, reports the AP.

"(Jun 3, 2016  9:55 AM CDT) A rare 1918 US postage stamp featuring an upside-down plane that was stolen six decades ago and ended up in Northern Ireland was returned to its American owner on Thursday. Keelin O'Neill, who inherited the stamp several years ago from his grandfather, turned it over at the World Stamp Show in New York to the American Philatelic Research Library and collected a $50,000 reward in the process. But the mystery surrounding the Inverted Jenny remains: Who stole it and three other such stamps at a 1955 convention in Virginia? Two of the other stamps were recovered years ago, and the fourth remains missing.  I had no idea about the history and importance of the stamp until very recently,  says O'Neill.  I have to say, it's quite fascinating, and I'm excited to learn more.  A hundred Inverted Jenny stamps were printed in 1918, until someone noticed the error. The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va. The stamps disappeared from a display case there, and it's been a whodunit ever since. Two were recovered in 1977 and 1982 from Chicago connoisseurs who had bought them.

"(Jul 3, 2018  9:45 AM CDT) A weeklong trial and three hours of jury deliberations have ended a family's  45-year nightmare.  Donnie Rudd, a 76-year-old former lawyer, was found guilty Monday of killing his teenage bride, Noreen Kumeta, a month after their 1973 wedding in Illinois' Cook County. Prosecutors argued Rudd staged the highway murder to look like a car accident before collecting $120,000 from life insurance policies and returning to live with another woman whom he later married. One of Rudd's stepdaughters from that marriage, who described his deception in a book called Living With the Devil, testified Rudd had left her mother just a day before his wedding.  I'm not asking you to like a guy who cheats on his girlfriend, but that doesn't mean he committed murder,  his lawyer, Tim Grace, tells the Chicago Tribune. Vowing that an appeal will be successful (if Rudd survives his cancer treatment), Grace adds,  It's outrageous to convict anyone on the testimony of someone trying to make a buck on a book.  But jurors also heard from three pathologists—one who autopsied Kumeta in 2013, finding she died of injuries inconsistent with being thrown from a car, as her husband claimed she was, and two who concurred. The autopsy came about through an investigation into the 1991 shooting death of one of Rudd's legal clients. Loretta Tabak-Bodtke, who'd threatened to report Rudd to the state's attorney disciplinary board after a squabble over money, was reportedly killed on the same day Rudd's car was seen at her home. He remains a suspect in that killing but hasn't been charged, per WLS.

"(Aug 19, 2016  12:05 PM CDT) In what authorities describe as a  chilling  case, New York police say a 23-year-old put his mother in a headlock and drowned her in the family's pool on Long Island on Wednesday. Assistant DA Robert Biancavilla says 63-year-old Elizabeth Cullen initially argued with her son, Denis Cullen, in the shallow end of the pool over whether Denis had taken his psychiatric medication. But when she poked him, per the AP, Denis dragged her into the deep end,  waited until she stopped moving, and then carried the body out of the pool,  Biancavilla tells CBS New York. Biancavilla says Denis tried to hide the body before stealing his mom's car, cash, and credit card. He then traveled to his sister's house where he reportedly confessed. Police were called to the scene and found Elizabeth Cullen dead in the backyard. Biancavilla adds that Denis—previously diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, per WABC—later confessed.  He said she struggled violently and he was surprised a woman of her stature could struggle as much as she did,  says Biancavilla, calling the description  chilling.  Denis, who is the nephew of former US Army Chief of Staff George Casey, is charged with second-degree murder.","Cops: Son, 23, Drowns Own Mom in Backyard Pool","Cops: Son, ____, Drowns Own Mom in Backyard Pool",23,Copy( 23 ),0
"(May 24, 2012  12:35 PM CDT) NASA wants to put humans into Mars' orbit by 2033, with the goal of having astronauts return to Earth with a canister of Mars rocks that would have been collected earlier and put into orbit. The goal was unveiled this week by an internal NASA study group working on the agency's Mars program with the goal of finding ways for NASA's human and robotic sides to integrate their work. Some at NASA are concerned, considering it's more difficult and more expensive to get humans to Mars than robots. On Nature's news blog, Eric Hand writes that  this is the first articulation I’ve seen of a specific, shared date for the key goal of both the human and robotic sides,  though the Obama administration has mentioned getting humans near Mars by around that same timeframe.",NASA's Goal: Man Near Mars in 21 Years,NASA's Goal: Man Near Mars in ____ Years,21,"Subtract( 2033 , 2012 )",1
"(Apr 26, 2017  6:50 PM CDT) Brennan Agranoff is the founder and CEO of a custom sock business that receives about 100 new orders per day—and he's just 17. Agranoff first came up with the idea for HoopSwagg when he was at a high school basketball game at age 13 and noticed all the boring athletic socks players were wearing; the company makes socks and other products, including shoelaces and arm sleeves, for basketball and other sports. Designs range from fairly standard (digital camo) to pretty out-there (unicorns farting rainbows).  My ideas, they're either really random or based on what is happening right now,  the Oregon high school junior, who has come up with more than 500 designs so far, tells KATU. The company's annual sales are more than $1 million, CNN Money reports. Agranoff has a number of part-time employees, and his mom works for the business full-time. One of his most popular designs involves pictures of the goats his family owns; Agranoff still has normal family chores, including feeding those goats, as well as his schoolwork. None of that stops him from working around 5 to 6 hours a day, he says. He taught himself how to code and do graphic design, and his parents were the first investors in his business, which he now runs from a 1,500-square-foot building on his family's property. Last week, HoopSwagg announced that it had purchased another custom athletic apparel company, its first acquisition. Agranoff plans to go to college eventually, but first he will work for his company full-time after graduating from high school six months early; he'd like to sell his products in brick-and-mortar stores. A pair of socks will run you $14.99. Agranoff hopes to someday allow customers to come up with their own designs.

A serial killer who first struck in 1988 and is believed to have raped and killed 11 women and mutilated a number of them has been apprehended and confessed, state-run media report by way of the AFP. Gao Chengyong, 52, was arrested thanks to a relative's transgression: His uncle had his DNA collected following an arrest and officials realized a relation of the man was the  Jack the Ripper  they have been seeking, the BBC reports. The 52-year-old Gao was found at the grocery store he operates in Gansu, a northwest province. The murders occurred in that region and in Inner Mongolia through the year 2002; it's unclear why they ceased. While Gao reportedly confessed, a motive wasn't given by police. There was reportedly a pattern to the murders though, in that women who were wearing red were often the victims, and many were young (the youngest just 8) and lived alone. China.org.cn reports by way of Beijing News that one victim was found stabbed in her apartment, but her dismembered hands were never located. The first alleged killing happened in the year Gao's wife gave birth to a son. The married man has two sons, and Sky News reports one told local media has father suffered  bitter[ly]  when he was young; the son referenced his father's failure to become a pilot.

Rescuers tracked the elephant for nearly two miles, then shot it with a tranquilizer and rescued the Russian woman and her 9-year-old daughter from the animal's back.  It took almost three hours for the elephant to calm down completely,  police officer Narong Laksanawimol said today.  We had to tie it to a tree.  The attack occurred about 15 minutes into a tour in the city of Phang Nga, about 310 miles south of Bangkok. The cause, Narong says, was  musth,  or aggressive horniness. The elephant had apparently never attacked anyone during its two-year stint with the tour company, but a Thai wildlife expert says elephants in  musth  are a known risk:  Bull elephants in musth are very dangerous and they shouldn't be part of these attractions,  he tells Australia's News Network.

"(Nov 9, 2014  9:53 AM) As Germany celebrated the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel honored the memory of the 138 people who died there and paid tribute to those who helped bring down the Wall, calling its collapse an example of the human yearning for freedom. On the night of Nov. 9, 1989, thousands of East Berliners streamed through the once-closed border crossings after communist authorities caved to mounting pressure.  It was about reclaiming freedom, about being citizens, not subjects,  Merkel said at the main memorial site for the Wall on Bernauer Strasse.  The fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true,  said Merkel, who grew up in East Germany.  Nothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are.  Activists staged a small demonstration during the memorial event, holding up a banner with the words  No wall around Europe  to protest the treatment of refugees trying to reach the continent. A million people were expected to attend today's festivities in Berlin, which included an open-air party at the city's Brandenburg Gate and the release of hundreds of helium-filled balloon strung along a 9-mile stretch of the former border. Merkel noted that Nov. 9 is also the day when, in 1938, Nazi paramilitaries launched a pogrom against the country's Jewish population in what became known as Reichskristallnacht—the  Night of Broken Glass.   That was the opening note for the murder of millions,  said Merkel, adding that on Nov. 9 each year  I feel not just joy, but the responsibility that German history burdens us with.","25 Years Ago Today, the Wall Came Down","____ Years Ago Today, the Wall Came Down",25,Copy( 25 ),0

"(Oct 24, 2015  4:48 PM CDT) When Larry Smith's father gave him a .38 revolver in late spring of 1989, he took it apart and stored it in his closet. A few weeks later, when he thought he saw someone trying to enter his fenced yard, he grabbed the gun before he went outside. He didn't return it to the closet, but stashed it in the bottom of his top dresser drawer. The next morning, his 10-year-old son Sean went looking for the Nintendo games his mother had hidden and found the revolver instead. He picked it up, waved it around, pointed it at a window, and just as his frightened 8-year-old sister Erin ran out of the room, pulled the trigger. The bullet entered her heart. He held her, trying to staunch the blood, and watched her eyes roll back. ''Please don't die. Please, God. Please, don't be dead,  Sean said in a 911 call, recounts the New York Times. By the time paramedics arrived, she was. Thirty years later, the Trace reports, Sean is finally pulling his life together. But from the moment he held his dead sister, through his desperate 911 call being played over and over as a public service announcement, through drug use and then abuse, the birth of a son, relapse, and a failed marriage, Sean says he has struggled with guilt. The shooting, by the way, was the first in a bloody week in Florida history that saw four more children accidentally shot across the state, with all but one of them dying. The state legislature, already adjourned for the year, went into special session just to pass a law making it illegal to leave a gun unsecured. (No charges were brought against Larry or Sean.) Now 28 states have similar laws on the books, and Florida, whose law came first and is among the most restrictive, has seen a 51% drop in unintentional shooting deaths of children.

She faces 62 counts of identity theft, 24 counts of criminal mistreatment, and 10 other charges; the charges date from September 2013 until July of this year.

Bassman, born in Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx, studied fabric design and fashion illustration, and became a protégé of Alexey Brodovitch, the Bazaar art director. She studied graphic design under him and soon became his first paid assistant; by 1945, she was sharing the art director title with him at Junior Bazaar. On her own, she experimented with darkroom methods and soon began taking her own photographs. She landed a lingerie company account, and became known for glamorizing the medium; her dreamy photographs received much acclaim in the 1940s and 1950s. But by the 1960s, she once told the New York Times, she  got sick of  the models.  They were becoming superstars. They were not my kind of models. They were dictating rather than taking direction.  She set aside more than 100 of her editorial negatives in trash bags and forgot about them, and moved on to photographing different subjects. In the early 1990s, her career experienced a revival when a fashion curator and historian discovered the negatives and Bassman reprinted them, experimenting with different methods.

"(Sep 25, 2017  12:00 PM CDT) Last Rampage, starring Robert Patrick and Heather Graham, had its limited release on Friday, and as the trailer promises,  blood will spill.  It's based on the true story of Gary Tison (played by Patrick), who in 1978 broke out of the Arizona State Prison with the help of his three sons and went on a murderous rampage during his quest to allegedly reach Mexico. As Richard Ruelas writes in a lengthy piece on the escape for the Arizona Republic, the movie  will undoubtedly take some dramatic license, as all films based on true events do. But with the Tison Gang, it becomes necessary.  That's because questions persist even now, though Ruelas tries to fill in the holes, outlining Tison's crimes for which he was serving life, his seemingly model prison behavior, and his two prior prison escape attempts. His third and final attempt took place on July 31, 1978, when sons Donald, Ricky, and Raymond—20, 19, and 18, respectively—arrived at the prison with a sawed-off shotgun concealed in a Salem cigarettes box. The four Tisons fled, along with inmate Randy Greenawalt. Authorities began a hunt for the green Ford LTD they took off in—except the group had quickly switched that one for a black Lincoln Continental. While on a remote stretch of Arizona 95, the car suffered its second flat, stranding the men. That is, until a US Marine, his wife, 22-month-old son, and niece stopped to offer a hand. The men took their car—and their lives. They'd kill again, this time a pair of newlyweds in Colorado, before being caught  purely by happenstance  on Aug. 11.

In the northern city of Kirkuk, a bomber killed 22 and wounded 150 at a demonstration against elections law. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but al-Qaeda is suspected. Women have carried out more than 20 suicide attacks this year, and al-Qaeda is thought to be relying more on women because they have more easily evaded security checks.

After the Los Angeles Times published its original exposé, more than 200 additional women got in touch with the paper to report their own stories of alleged harassment at Toback's hands, the Times reports in a follow-up article. That number includes Today anchor Natalie Morales. Most of their stories involve Toback approaching them to offer to make them a star, and then, at what was supposed to be an interview or audition, asking sexually inappropriate questions before, in many cases, dry-humping the women or masturbating in front of them. The Times hasn't verified the new accounts. Many people have also called the LAPD to report disturbing encounters with Toback, the department confirms; it's looking into the calls to determine whether an investigation is warranted. In New York, where Toback lives and where many of the encounters allegedly took place, those who say they're victims are being told to get in touch with the Manhattan DA's office, and several of the women accusing Toback say they've done so. Toback's longtime agent has dropped him as a client, and others in the showbiz industry have come out against him, with some saying they've disliked the 72-year-old director for years.

AL.com reports that how he paid for all of this is now being called into question due to some ethics disclosure paperwork he recently filed with the state, in which he noted he has received more than $750,000 in  compensation  over the past three years from a  Food Provisions  account—namely, funds offered by federal, state, and municipal governments to feed prisoners in the Etowah County Jail. And Entrekin says it's completely legal, based on an antiquated state law passed before World War II that apparently allows sheriffs to keep  excess  funds meant to feed prisoners. AL.com says the state law is  likely  being exploited by other Alabama sheriffs as well. However, other counties that end up with a surplus give the money to the county government so it can be put to use elsewhere instead of lining the sheriffs' pockets.  I believe the funds belong to the taxpayers and any excess funds should go toward things that benefit the taxpayer,  the police chief of Rainbow City, who used to work under the former Etowah County sheriff, says.

Since the 1980s, outstanding home-equity loans—once called second mortgages—have exploded a thousandfold to more than $1 trillion. The New York Times looks at how banks waged a concerted advertising campaign to transform Americans' attitude toward debt, enriching themselves while leading homeowners to financial ruin. Banks across America made billions assuring customers that money was  hidden in your house.

"(Jan 21, 2019  3:05 AM) The Newark to Hong Kong route is one of the world's longest flights. And for United Airlines passengers on Saturday, it was much longer than usual—and they ended back in Newark at the end of it. The passengers were stuck on the ground in frigid weather at a Canadian military base for more than 14 hours after the flight had to divert to Goose Bay, Newfoundland, due to a medical emergency, CNN reports.  After medical professionals helped the passenger off, we were told we were just refueling and then we’d head back to Newark,  passenger Steven Lau tells NBC.  But there was an issue with getting one of the emergency exit doors securely closed.  At midnight—nine hours after the aircraft had taken off from Newark and three hours after landing at Goose Bay—passengers were told that the door had frozen shut and another plane would be sent to bring them back to Newark. As temperatures dropped to -20 outside, passengers were not allowed to leave the plane because customs officers were not on duty overnight. Wrestler Sonjay Dutt tells the CBC that the crew handed out blankets as the cold became  uncomfortable  inside the plane. As food ran low, passengers called for help on Twitter, saying people  were not doing well.  Canadian officials brought coffee and food from Tim Horton's Sunday morning and passengers were allowed to stretch their legs in the terminal building. United sent a plane—with food—to bring the passengers back to Newark, where they arrived Sunday evening. The airline says it is doing all it can to assist the passengers, though Lau says some of them have decided to just scrap their trips to Hong Kong.

"(Aug 10, 2016  3:33 AM CDT) Hillary Clinton's campaign has stepped up its efforts to win two states that haven't voted Democratic in a presidential election since another Clinton was on the ballot: Arizona and Georgia. Perhaps more surprising, they have hopes in Utah, too. Democratic sources tell the Washington Post that Clinton's campaign has started sending funds to hire more organizers in Arizona and Georgia, where the latest polls show Donald Trump either losing or only narrowly ahead. Democrats in the two states tell NBC that they are hoping for a breakthrough this year because Trump has alienated so many key groups of voters that he has been a  unique and wonderful  addition to voter mobilization efforts. In Utah, meanwhile, Democrats now believe they have a chance of breaking a losing streak that goes back to 1968, the New York Times reports. Some 72.6% of the state's voters chose Mitt Romney in 2012, the highest proportion in the nation, but Mormons are deeply uneasy with Trump, not least because his rhetoric on Muslims reminds them of when their own religion was persecuted. Libertarian Gary Johnson and new entrant Evan McMullin, a Mormon, could draw more votes away from Trump.  This is the first time since the mid-1960s that a Democratic presidential candidate could win in Utah,  says state Democratic Party chairman Peter Corroon.

"(Mar 27, 2019  12:19 PM CDT) Can regular farting equal bullying? An appeals court in Australia will have to decide based on a nearly $1.3 million lawsuit filed in 2017 by the former employee of a construction company, who refers to his ex-boss as  Mr. Stinky.  David Hingst, a 56-year-old former engineer of Melbourne's Construction Engineering, says supervisor Greg Short would enter Hingst's small, windowless office to fart  five or six times a day  as part of a larger conspiracy to terminate his employment, the Washington Post reports. Before Hingst was eventually laid off,  I would be sitting with my face to the wall and he would come into the room … fart behind me and walk away,  the engineer says, per News.com.au, adding he eventually sprayed deodorant at his superior.  I may have done it once or twice, maybe … but I can't recall,  Short told the Supreme Court of Victoria last year. He said if he had farted on or near Hingst, it was not with bad intentions, per the New York Daily News. The court also heard of alleged phone calls in which Short called Hingst  an idiot,  per the BBC, but ultimately Justice Rita Zammit dismissed the suit last April, noting there was  some inappropriate behavior in the office, including passing wind,  but that it  would not necessarily amount to bullying.  Hingst appealed, and the Court of Appeal heard his claims of harassment, psychiatric trauma, and  severe stress  on Monday.

"(Dec 8, 2012  8:06 AM) During the war in Afghanistan, the US has detained some 200 teenage  enemy combatants,  each for about a year, American officials tell the UN. The youths have been held at a military prison near Bagram Airfield not as punishment, but in order to prevent them  from returning to the battlefield,  the US report says. Some are still being held in a facility that will soon be controlled by the Afghan government, the AP reports. Officials say the teens' ages aren't typically known until after they're captured. The US says the average age is about 16, which means many were likely younger than that, says an ACLU rep. The head of an advocacy group notes that she's  represented children as young as 11 or 12 who have been at Bagram,  noting that detainees aren't allowed  to contest their age  and that 200 seems like a low estimate. According to the report, detainees  would generally not be provided legal assistance  because they weren't charged with a crime. A yearlong detention means  greater risk of physical and mental abuse, especially if they are denied access to the protections guaranteed to them under international law,  adds the ACLU spokesman.

"(Mar 26, 2020  2:21 AM CDT) The Trump administration has been controversially referring to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as the  Chinese virus  or  Wuhan virus,  and three officials from G7 countries tell the Washington Post that Mike Pompeo's insistence on using the term  Wuhan virus  led to a rift at Wednesday's Group of Seven meeting, which was held via video conference. Per ABC News, foreign ministers were planning to issue a joint declaration on the virus, but Pompeo insisted the term  Wuhan virus,  which has been decried by world leaders and health organizations, be included. Because of that, the ministers failed to agree on a joint statement, and no statement specifically referencing the pandemic was issued. Meanwhile, the president himself has stopped calling it the  Chinese virus  because, he says,  Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it.   We tried, you’ll remember, from the opening days to get our scientists, our experts on the ground there so that we could begin to assist in the global response to what began there in China, but we weren’t able to do that. The Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t permit that to happen,  Pompeo said at the meeting.  The Chinese Communist Party poses a substantial threat to our health and way of life, as the Wuhan virus outbreak clearly has demonstrated.  After the meeting, Pompeo downplayed the role of the term in the group's discussions, saying there were simply  tactical differences  in how ministers wanted to approach the situation.  Make no mistake about it,  he said, per Fox News,  everyone in that meeting this morning was very focused on making sure that we not only solve the health crisis associated with the Wuhan virus but also the economic challenges that face the globe as we confront it as well.","At G7, Pompeo's Insistence on 'Wuhan Virus' Caused Rift","At G____, Pompeo's Insistence on 'Wuhan Virus' Caused Rift",7,Copy( 7 ),0

The Portuguese had to win their first major trophy the hard way on Sunday, stunning France 1-0 after extra time in the European Championship final, having played without Ronaldo from the 25th minute, the AP reports. Two hours after being carried off the field on a stretcher, the three-time world player of the year returned a champion for the first time with his country.  I had bad luck because I had a small injury in the beginning of the game, but my colleagues did their part—they run, they fight,  said Ronaldo.  Nobody believed in Portugal, but we won.  An unlikely scorer secured the pre-tournament outsiders a title at last. It could be an uncomfortable few months ahead for Ederzito Lopes, better known as Eder, the unheralded striker who will return shortly to French club Lille after breaking French hearts with his 109th-minute goal. A second-half substitute, Eder scored only his fourth goal in 29 appearances for Portugal with a low shot from 25 yards past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

The issue got attention in 2003, when untested kits from more than 500,000 criminal cases were found in labs around the country, but the evidence backlog remains at 180,000, Congress estimates.

So while victims wait—often years—for their samples to be tested and the DNA results matched, perpetrators are out there victimizing other women. But there are hopeful signs.

"(Nov 3, 2015  10:07 AM) More than a year after he took his own life, Robin Williams' widow is talking about his final days. In interviews with People and Good Morning America, Susan Williams says that it was Lewy Body Dementia or DLB, an incurable brain disease commonly associated with Parkinson's, that drove her husband to take his own life, though it was not diagnosed until after his death.  It was not depression that killed Robin,  she tells People.  Depression was one of let's call it 50 symptoms and it was a small one.  In the year before his death, Williams had dealt with other symptoms, including anxiety and impaired movement, as the couple struggled to figure out what was going on; in his final months, the symptoms became overwhelming.  I've spent this last year trying to find out what killed Robin,  Williams says.  One of the doctors said, 'Robin was very aware that he was losing his mind and there was nothing he could do about it.'   If Robin was lucky, he would've had maybe three years left,  Williams tells ABC News.  And they would've been hard years. And it's a good chance he would've been locked up.  During his final months, Williams was diagnosed with the early stages of Parkinson's, and things got worse:  My best friend was sinking,  she says,  just disintegrating before my eyes.   One minute, totally lucid ... and then five minutes later, he would say something that wasn't—it didn't match.  During the last month of his life,  he could not  keep it together, she says, but she notes that—though he did check into rehab during his final month—he had been sober for eight years when he died. On the night before he was found dead—during a week that he was supposed to check into a facility for neurocognitive testing—his last words to her were,  Goodnight, my love. Goodnight, goodnight.

"(Jun 16, 2016  6:58 AM CDT) It's been 40 years since a violent serial burglar, rapist, and killer started to terrorize Northern California, but the FBI this week announced there is a new, concerted push to find the so-called  East Area Rapist.  Described as a white male about 5-foot-10 with blond or light brown hair, an athletic build, and possible training in military or law enforcement, the suspect is likely between 60 and 75 years old and has been linked to at least 52 sexual assaults in the Bay Area and Sacramento County in the 1970s and '80s. The bureau is offering a $50,000 reward for information that helps identify him and is launching a national campaign that includes billboards. No crimes have been connected to the man since 18-year-old Janelle Cruz was raped and bludgeoned to death in her family's home in Irvine, Calif., in 1986, reports the Los Angeles Times. And yet,  We believe he's alive,  says Sgt. Paul Belli of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau.  There's no reason to believe he's not alive.  After serial killer Richard Ramirez became known as the  Night Stalker  in the mid-'80s when he terrorized the Los Angeles area, the East Area Rapist took on the moniker  Original Night Stalker  and has stumped investigators ever since. But DA Anne Marie Schubert, who was 12 and in East Sacramento during the first attacks, says memories haven't faded, reports the Sacramento Bee.  In essence, a community was taken hostage,  she says. The suspect is linked to more than 175 crimes since he attacked a woman in 1976, including 45 rapes and 12 homicides. He's known for targeting couples, tying them up, and taking jewelry or coins.

"(Jun 15, 2016  6:01 PM CDT) The state of Louisiana's refusal to install air conditioning on death row has already cost taxpayers at least $1,067,000 in expenses fighting a lawsuit filed on behalf of three inmates with medical problems, according to records obtained by the AP. Meanwhile the state could spend roughly the same money—and possibly much less—on an AC system that would satisfy a federal judge's order to protect death row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. This tally, based on state documents provided in response to the AP's public records requests, is the first public accounting of how much the case has cost taxpayers. Most of the money has gone to private attorneys on opposing sides of the case, which US District Judge Brian Jackson says could ultimately cost many more millions of dollars, and expert witnesses and state contractors also have received tens of thousands of dollars. More than two years have passed since Jackson ruled Louisiana imposes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment once the heat index exceeds 88 degrees. The index routinely crosses that threshold on death row, occasionally exceeding 100 degrees; plaintiff James Magee said it's like a  sauna  in the morning and an  oven  in the afternoon. A plaintiffs' expert estimated it would cost about $225,000—sans engineering fees or operating costs—to install AC on death row's six tiers. A state engineer in 2014 said nine AC units could cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that holds death row, with a state attorney saying each unit would cost  several thousand dollars.  State attorneys argue installing AC would spawn more suits from prisoners nationwide demanding cooler cells. Jackson is set to hear testimony Wednesday on whether the state's current heat remediation measures—one cold shower a day, ice chests in the cells, and fans outside—are adequately protecting the plaintiffs as Louisiana's sweltering summer approaches.",La.

Three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang, 28, was found guilty of breaking anti-doping rules when sample collectors paid a visit to his home following the 2018 Asian Games, where he won several gold medals, per the New York Times. During a trial in November, the Court of Arbitration for Sport heard how Sun's mother had instructed a security guard to take a hammer to vials of Sun's blood, per the AP.  The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control,  the CAS says. Before the World Anti-Doping Agency brought its complaint, swimming's governing body FINA had issued only a warning to Sun, who claimed collectors lacked proper paperwork. Rivals have long accused Sun—banned for three months by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a banned stimulant in 2014—of doping. WADA, which requested a ban of two to eight years, said it is satisfied with the ruling, which leaves Sun unable to defend his 200-meter freestyle title at the Tokyo Olympics later this year. But Chinese fans are outraged, per the Times, which describes Sun as  a national hero.   This is unfair.

"(Nov 21, 2018  1:04 PM) A Michigan judge acknowledged that female genital mutilation is  despicable —in a 28-page opinion that concluded the federal government's 22-year-old law against the practice is unconstitutional. As such, the mutilation charges against two Michigan doctors have been dismissed. Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, who allegedly performed the surgery, and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, who allegedly allowed his Livonia clinic to be used, were defendants in America's first female genital mutilation case, which involves 9 alleged victims. Lawyers for the doctors argued the constitutionality point, and US District Judge Bernard Friedman found  FGM is a 'local criminal activity' which, in keeping with long-standing tradition and our federal system of government, is for the states to regulate, not Congress.  The Detroit Free-Press explains the federal law was passed under the Commerce clause; Friedman determined there was  nothing commercial or economic  about the mutilation, while the prosecution argued interstate commerce can be at play, as when parents drive their girls across state lines to undergo the procedure. As for state regulation, 27 states ban it, and Michigan is included in that list. But its law was passed subsequent to Nagarwala's April 2017 arrest, reports the AP; as such, it can't be applied to the doctors, and so prosecutors were relying on the federal law, which carries a sentence of up to five years. Prosecutors say they will decide whether to appeal the ruling. Nagarwala isn't off the hook, however, and faces conspiracy and obstruction charges that carry a sentence of up to 20 years if she's convicted. The trial is set to begin in April.

He died Tuesday morning after suffering a heart attack, his wife Nancy tells the AP. Though Lange had a successful career in radio, he is best known for his television role on the ABC game show, which debuted in 1965 and on which he appeared for more than a decade, charming audiences with his mellifluous voice and wide, easygoing grin. He also played host to many celebrity guests. Michael Jackson, Steve Martin, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, appeared as contestants. Even a pre-Charlie's Angels Farrah Fawcett appeared on the program, introduced as  an accomplished artist and sculptress  with a dream to open her own gallery.

But he didn't want to confess to a crime he insists he didn't commit, and so  an innocent person is in prison right now.  That quote isn't from Malee—it's from one of the two boys whose accusations landed him there. For the Frederick News-Post, Cameron Dodd digs into Malee's case, which rested upon the testimony of two boys—8 and 12 when they testified, 3 and 7 when the abuse allegedly happened—who now say Malee was no abuser. Identified by their middle names, Kyle, now 30, and Eugene, 26, are the children of Hilda Smith, a woman Malee dated in his mid-30s; they all lived together for a time in Maryland. In July 1996, Malee was arrested after being accused of abusing a female relative (both his trials ended in hung juries), and during that time, Smith's kids were placed in foster care. The boys were split up in November 1997, and Kyle told his new foster mom about the alleged sexual abuse (he eventually accused five adults, with his claims including that his grandparents had videotaped Malee and Hilda Smith abusing them and then buried the tapes). Prosecutor Charlie Smith said Eugene made allegations of his own around the same time. Malee was shocked, having  never been alone with [the boys] for more than a few minutes,  writes Dodd.

The 37-year-old had wanted to remain anonymous, but such a feat isn't possible in Arizona, where lottery winners are a matter of public record. The AP learned his name after filing a public records request. Here's what it has since pieced together on him: Good is married, and moved from Pennsylvania to a $289,900 2,500-square-foot home in what the AP describes as  an affluent Phoenix suburb  last year. Lottery officials described him as a professional who has no immediate plans to quit his job, though he certainly could: Good took the one-time payout of $192 million, telling lottery officials the looming fiscal cliff was the reason he claimed the winnings now and not in 2013. Neighbors described Good pleasantly, telling scintillating tales about how he once helped carry a table to a neighbor's house.

"(Dec 11, 2020  12:09 AM) The pandemic appears to have done what years of increasingly dire warnings about climate change couldn't. Global carbon dioxide emissions fell by an estimated 7% in 2020, the largest drop on record, according to the Global Carbon Project. The emissions reduction was mainly the result of lockdowns keeping people at home and massively reducing international travel, Axios reports. According to a report in the journal Earth System Science Data, carbon emissions dived 12% in the US and 11% in Europe but just 1.7% in China. Study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia, says the drop was less pronounced in China because the country had much less of a second wave and more of its emissions come from industry, not transportation, reports the AP.  The restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19 led to dramatic and unprecedented changes in society, and this caused large changes in CO2 emissions,  the report states.  All countries had significant deviations from their previous emission trends.   Of course, lockdown is absolutely not the way to tackle climate change,  LeQuere says, but emissions growth had already slowed noticeably in 2019 and scientists hope that year could mark the peak year for carbon emissions. Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says that to limit warming, the economic recovery shouldn't  go down the old path,  the Guardian reports.

"(Sep 19, 2018  2:59 AM CDT) Four young men who were repeatedly raped by their catechism teacher have received one of the Catholic Church's biggest-ever settlements with abuse victims. The New York Diocese of Brooklyn says the men, who were abused between the ages of 8 and 12 and are now ages 19 to 21, will receive $6.875 million each under the terms of the settlement, NBC News reports. Angelo Serrano, former director of religious education at St. Lucy's-St. Patrick's Church, was arrested in 2009 after one of the boys told his mother about the abuse. The 67-year-old is currently serving a 15-year sentence. Lawyers for the victims say other boys were severely abused, but  the statute of limitations prevents their claims from being brought.  After the victims sued, the diocese argued that it shouldn't be held responsible for the abuse because Serrano was officially a volunteer, not an employee, even though he received a stipend from the church, the New York Times reports. A judge, however, found that priests and parish workers ignored signs of abuse, including the fact that Serrano regularly had young boys sleep over at his apartment. In a deposition, Father Stephen Lynch admitted that he had seen Serrano inappropriately embrace an 8- or 9-year-old boy and kiss him on the lips.  These were egregious incidences of sexual abuse,  attorney Ben Rabinowitz tells the New York Post.

It slammed into her twice, first pushing her 2007 Chrysler Sebring into the bridge's barrier and then catapulting it atop the 3.5-foot-high wall, where it briefly teetered—before falling some 40 feet into what the Baltimore Sun reports was no more than 8 feet of water. Lake tells the Washington Post that she  started to drown.  Then she resolved to live.  I went from panic to calm,  she explains, and methodically unbuckled herself, pulled herself through the car's shattered window, and swam toward the surface. From there, she reportedly swam to one of the bridge's supports, and a boater assisted her until officials could come to her aid. Amazing fact No. 1: Her injuries amounted to only bumps and bruises. Amazing fact No. 2: It could have been much worse. The bridge, which reaches a height of 186 feet, is so renowned for being a fearful span to cross that police have been known to get behind the wheel for motorists who are too afraid to cross it.

"(Jul 9, 2019  9:39 AM CDT) H. Ross Perot, the colorful, self-made Texas billionaire who rose from a childhood of Depression-era poverty and twice ran for president as a third-party candidate, has died at age 89. Perot, whose 19% of the vote in 1992 stands among the best showings by an independent candidate in the past century, died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family, family spokesman James Fuller said, per the AP. Perot's wealth, fame, and confident prescription for the nation's economic ills propelled his 1992 campaign against President George HW Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Some Republicans blamed him for Bush's loss to Clinton as Perot garnered the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 bid. During the campaign, Perot spent $63.5 million of his own money and bought up 30-minute television spots. He used charts and graphs to make his points, summarizing them with a line that became a national catchphrase:  It's just that simple.  As a boy in Texarkana, Texas, Perot delivered newspapers from the back of a pony. He earned his billions in a more modern way, however—by building Electronic Data Systems Corp., which helped other companies manage their computer networks. Yet the most famous event in his career didn't involve sales and earnings: He financed a private commando raid in 1979 to free two EDS employees who were being held in a prison in Iran.

"(Aug 24, 2017  5:29 PM CDT) What Michelle Carter texted to Conrad Roy III is well known: The Massachusetts teens' communications, obtained by police after Roy's suicide, filled 317 pages. Many of them, particularly the ones in which Carter seemingly encouraged Roy to take his life, were read in court during Carter's involuntary manslaughter trial. It ended just weeks ago, with a judge finding her guilty and sentencing her to 15 months. In a piece for Esquire, Jesse Barron tries to get inside Carter's mind, turning up details that haven't previously been reported. He explains that the prosecution suggested that Carter, desperate for attention from her mostly indifferent classmates, craved the spotlight her  boyfriend's  death would bring (Carter's friends told Barron she only started calling him that after his death). The prosecution argued texts sent to two friends over the two days before Roy died—in which Carter told the girls he was missing and she was freaking out, though she was texting with a very-alive Roy at the same time—amounted to a  dry run.  Barron doesn't buy that line, and  saw the shadow of another story  in the evidence. He digs into Carter's relationship with Alice Felzmann, a girl with whom Carter was inseparable until Felzmann ghosted on her.  The week before Conrad's suicide, Michelle's mind was somewhere else,  he writes, uncovering texts Carter sent about Felzmann and her grief over their lack of a relationship to a number of girls.

Travis Hittson, 45—convicted in the April 1992 killing of Conway Utterbeck—was declared dead at 8:14pm after receiving an injection of barbiturate pentobarbital at the state prison in Jackson. When asked if he wanted to make a final statement, Hittson said,  No, sir. I'm alright.  Hittson blinked repeatedly for several minutes and then appeared to take several deep breaths before becoming still about four minutes after the warden left the execution chamber. The AP recounts the crime: Hittson's lawyers had said he was mistreated as a child and constantly craved the approval of others. That, they said, combined with alcoholism and relatively low intelligence, made it easy for his direct supervisor in the Navy, Edward Vollmer, to manipulate him into killing Utterbeck while the three were visiting Vollmer's parents' home in central Georgia. Hittson told investigators he and Vollmer went out drinking one night and Vollmer said Utterbeck planned to kill them both and that they needed to  get him  first. Upon returning to the house, Hittson shot Utterbeck in the head, according to court filings. They buried Utterbeck's torso in Georgia and the rest of the remains in Pensacola, Florida, where they were stationed.

And her former staff wants them to wait a little longer.

"(Apr 16, 2013  8:40 AM CDT) For anyone looking for a miracle amidst the gloomy news, the Vatican provides: The Denver Post reports that Pope Francis has set a 19th-century German nun on a journey toward sainthood after verifying she was responsible for healing a Colorado Springs boy in 1999. In the first days of his papacy, Francis upheld the miracle, which will allow for Mother Theresia Bonzel's November beatification. One more miracle is needed for sainthood. As the Post explains, the now-18-year-old Luke Burgie was struck with a mystery illness on his first day of preschool, a severe gastrointestinal condition that stumped his doctors, who were unable to ease his suffering. After six months of violent diarrhea, which struck as many as 10 times a day, the illness mysteriously vanished—on the final day of a novena two members of Bonzel's order had prayed, in which they asked Bonzel for help. A rigorous investigation carried out by the Vatican and independent medical experts ensued over the next 14 years: to verify the Burgie family hadn't intentionally caused the disorder via, say, laxatives, and to review all available medical records. Now Bonzel is on her way, though Luke Burgie, for his part, isn't talking about it.

A judge this week awarded the legal team $4.6 million after last year's successful copyright lawsuit, reports Courthouse News Service. The money will come out of a $14 million class-action settlement being paid by music publisher Warner/Chappell. In the case, documentary filmmaker Jennifer Nelson sued the company after it charged her a $1,500 licensing fee for including the song in her film about its origins. A federal judge ultimately concluded that Warner/Chappell's claim on the copyright of the famous tune was dubious. US District Judge George King ruled this week that her lawyers deserved $3.85 million for their work, plus a bonus of sorts.  Given the unusually positive results achieved by the settlement, the highly complex nature of the action, the risk class counsel faced by taking this case on a contingency-fee basis, and the impressive skill and effort of counsel, we conclude that a 1.2 multiplier is warranted,  wrote King, per Ars Technica.

Ben Hill County Sheriff Bobby McLemore tells WFXL-TV the seven suspects, who range in age from 17 to 28 years old, all face charges of malice murder, aggravated assault, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Authorities say three masked men broke into 20-year-old Craigory Burch Jr.'s Fitzgerald home in January and demanded money as he was holding his 2-year-old child. The men reportedly first shot Burch in the legs before leaving, but they then came back inside and shot him again. The attack came two months after Burch won $434,272 from hitting the Fantasy 5 jackpot.  When they came in, he said, 'Don't do it, bro. ...

Larry Ely Murillo-Moncada, 25, was reported missing Nov. 28, 2009, after he became upset and ran out of his parents' home.  It was a snowstorm at the time,  Sgt. Brandon Danielson tells the Des Moines Register.  He left with no shoes, no socks, no keys, no car.  Relatives said a day earlier, after Murillo-Moncada finished a shift at the No Frills supermarket, he seemed disoriented and said he was hearing voices. Police believe Murillo-Moncada went to the supermarket after leaving the home, climbed on top of the freezer units, and fell into an 18-inch gap between the back of the units and the wall. Police say Murillo-Moncada—who was 5-foot-5 and weighed 140 pounds—fell about 12 feet into the area where he was trapped. They say the noise of the units would have made it impossible for anyone to hear cries for help. No Frills closed the store in 2016, reports the Omaha World-Herald. Former employees say the top of the freezer units were used for storage and it was not unusual for workers to be up there. Authorities said Monday that the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation had used DNA from relatives to identify Murillo-Moncada.

Per the Presidential Records Act, such papers can be held for 12 years after a president leaves office, meaning they could have been available in January 2013.

His patient, a 38-year-old woman, had experienced sudden weight gain of about 10 pounds per week for two months and went to her OB/GYN, per Live Science. A CT scan then revealed a noncancerous tumor growing on her left ovary. Because the  mucinous  mass grew to sit on her digestive tract, the 350-pound patient was  extremely malnourished  ahead of surgery and  used a wheelchair because of the tumor's weight,  Andikyan says. The tumor itself was  gigantic,  pushing up against blood vessels and putting the woman at risk of potentially fatal blood clots, doctors tell CNN.

"(Jun 26, 2020  12:33 PM CDT) Ancient dogs specially adapted to the cold have been helping humans survive in the Arctic for a surprisingly long time—more than 10,000 years—a new study suggests.  Until now, we have thought that sledge dogs were only [2,000 to] 3,000 years old,  says Mikkel Sinding, a University of Copenhagen geneticist and co-author of the study in Science. But in comparing DNA from a dog that lived 9,500 years ago on Zhokhov Island, where evidence of early dog sleds has been found, to the genetics of modern sled dogs (including Alaskan and Siberian huskies, Alaskan malamutes, and dogs in Greenland), researchers found they share many of the same genes.  This means that modern sledge dogs and [the Zhokhov dog] had the same common origin in Siberia more than 9,500 years ago,  says Sinding. Dogs in Greenland, for example, don't seem to have changed much from their Zhokhov ancestor.  It’s largely the same dogs doing the same thing,  Sinding says. It's not clear when the first sled dog was domesticated, but the Zhokhov dog was already  a long way down the path to domestication,  Sinding tells New Scientist. Like modern sled dogs, it had long fur and thick pads on its feet. Modern sled dogs may have also received from their ancestors an adaptation allowing them to thrive on a fat-rich diet. Ice Age Siberians probably didn't mind sharing their hunted seals and polar bears. As co-author Shyam Gopalakrishnan tells NBC News, the ability  to move large amounts of material, kills and food across large spaces in such difficult terrain  was perhaps  instrumental in humans settling the Arctic.","Humans and Sled Dogs: a 10,000-Year History",Humans and Sled Dogs: a ____-Year History,"10,000","Copy( 10,000 )",0

Family, friends, and coworkers are mourning the loss of the NYPD officer and Bronx native who was fatally shot early Wednesday only a few miles from her home. A longtime friend says Familia grew up during the crack epidemic, and that made her want to help people. The New York Daily News reports Familia spent five years as a nurse at New York University Hospital and another two years at the American Red Cross before joining the NYPD 12 years ago.  Fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform every day and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the Bronx,  the head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association says. Familia didn't just take care of the citizens of New York, she also raised three children while caring for her elderly mother.  There is not one single negative thing that anyone can say about her,  the president of the Dominican Officers Association says.  That’s not because of her death—that’s just her nature.  Familia was shot and killed while sitting in a police vehicle. It's unclear why she was shot, and she didn't know the shooter, who was killed by police a short time later. Jeff Sessions says Familia's death is the  latest in a troubling series of attacks on police officers over the past two years,  the Washington Post reports.

The deal would raise the ceiling by $2.4 trillion in two phases, enough to last into 2013, in exchange for up to $2.4 trillion in cuts—$1 trillion over the next 10 years agreed to now, with up to $1.6 trillion in deficit reduction to be named later. The final amount in cuts would match the amount the debt ceiling is raised. Congress would have until Dec. 23 to agree to the additional deficit reductions—which could include further spending cuts or tax increases. Should no deal be reached, an across-the-board cut would hit everything, including defense and Medicare, by up to 4%.

The Sun-Times reports MASK volunteers often occupy the corner of 75th Street and Stewart Avenue in the Englewood neighborhood—ABC News describes it as a corner  they had been working to reclaim from gun violence.

David Stephen Young of Britain had been sober for 18 months when the 44-year-old alcoholic, troubled by a family death and failed marriage, consumed six drinks before his London-bound flight out of Calgary on Jan. 4, reports the CBC. Shortly after takeoff, he became belligerent, forcing his way into a locked washroom while the seatbelt signs were turned on.

"(Feb 10, 2015  8:58 AM) Lest we forget: The Equal Justice Initiative today released a report that documents 3,959  racial terror lynchings  throughout 12 Southern states over the 1877 to 1950 period. That's  at least 700 more lynchings of black people in these states than previously reported,  reports the EJI in what it calls  the most comprehensive work done on lynching to date,  the result of four years of research. The New York Times reports that in 1882, the Chicago Tribune started annually publishing a list of the prior year's lynchings; the Tuskegee Institute and NAACP published lists in the early 20th century, and researchers in 1995 used all the existing documentation to create a master list. As for the 700 names that hadn't previously been recorded, one of those 1995 researchers, EM Beck, says that the definition of a lynching varies from list to list (the EJI's includes some  one-time massacres of large numbers of African-Americans,  per the Times). But  if you're trying to make a point that the amount of racial violence is underestimated, well then, there's no doubt about it,  says Beck. The report asserts the lynchings were a form of terrorism, writing they  were not 'frontier justice' because they generally took place in communities where there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for African Americans.  Further,  racial terror lynching was ... a tactic for maintaining racial control, not merely punishment of an alleged perpetrator for an alleged crime.  The report illustrates some of the social grievances men were lynched for: knocking on a white woman's door (General Lee, 1904, Reevesville, SC) and bumping into a white woman while running to catch a train (Jeff Brown, 1916, Cedar Bluff, Miss.). The EJI hopes to erect memorials or markers at some of the lynching sites; the Guardian reports few currently exist and notes that EJI Director Bryan Stevenson expects challenges in terms of securing funding and approval.",South's History of 'Racial Terror': 700 Newly Found Lynchings,South's History of 'Racial Terror': ____ Newly Found Lynchings,700,Copy( 700 ),0
"(Mar 31, 2015  7:07 PM CDT) An 840-pound emerald is still without a clear owner after six years in police custody, but that could be settled soon in Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Michael Johnson says a case to determine the rightful owner of the 180,000-carat Bahia Emerald, found in Brazil in 2001, will move forward—despite Brazil's claims it was illegally mined, reports the Los Angeles Times. Brazil had asked the judge to dismiss the case so it could negotiate the emerald's return with the US government, but no luck. At one time, eight people claimed ownership, but several claims have been dismissed over the years. The last remaining one is led by Idaho businessman Kit Morrison, who had the gem in his possession when police traced it to a Las Vegas vault in 2009. But the history of the Bahia emerald is far more complicated than that, Bloomberg reports. The rock changed hands repeatedly before its confiscation, at one point ending up submerged in a New Orleans vault during Hurricane Katrina. It was also involved in plots with the Brazilian Mafia, along with a $197 million Bernie Madoff transaction, Fox News reports. It once went up on eBay for $75 million. Morrison finally ended up in possession, though another man—the guy who put it up on eBay, investor Larry Biegler—then called police to report it stolen, leading to its confiscation. And that's just a small sense of why it's taken six years to get this far. If Morrison is declared the owner, Brazil's hope of reclaiming the gem would be complicated, unless it's willing to pay up.

Before joining Fox, she had her own show at CNN. But with the Fox and MSNBC audiences usually diametrically opposed, it proved a poor fit. MSNBC has had its best ratings in network history in 2017, but Van Susteren hasn't shared in the riches. It was the least-watched show on MSNBC between 5pm and midnight both Monday and Tuesday of this week, according to the Nielsen company. On Monday, for example, MSNBC's Meet the Press Daily at 5pm had 970,000 viewers, and Van Susteren's show dipped to 797,000. When Chris Matthews' Hardball started at 7pm, the network's audience jumped to 1.45 million, Nielsen said. The show is ending despite the public backing of Van Susteren's friend and MSNBC's most popular host, Rachel Maddow. Van Susteren tweeted  I'm out at MSNBC  before MSNBC made its announcement Thursday afternoon. She had no immediate comment about the ouster. In a note to staff, MSNBC President Phil Griffin called Van Susteren  a well-regarded television veteran and one of only a few broadcasters who can say they've hosted shows at all three major cable news networks. We are grateful to her and wish her the best.  Melber will begin as permanent 6pm host sometime next month.",Greta Van Susteren Is Out at MSNBC After Less Than 6 Months,Greta Van Susteren Is Out at MSNBC After Less Than ____ Months,6,Copy( 6 ),0

She was railing against the  foolishness  of President Obama’s decision to get involved in Libya at the time, The Raw Story reports. Obama  said he wanted to go in for humanitarian purposes and overnight we are hearing that potentially 10 to 30,000 people could have been killed in the strike,  she said. Chris Wallace quickly questioned her numbers, but Bachmann stood her ground, citing  the Tripoli ambassador.   You mean the Libyans? You think Moammar Gadhafi is a reliable person?  he responded.  I don't think anyone thinks that,  she said.  The point of what I'm saying is that we are seeing many, many lives lost. Including innocent civilians' lives.  Wallace later corrected her, explaining that she was apparently referring to a statement by the US Ambassador to Libya that put the total number killed in Libya at 10,000 to 30,000, which includes those killed by fighting between the rebels and Gadhafi’s forces. Perhaps Bachmann’s confusion can be attributed to this little tidbit: Politico notes that she once again tried to explain her March gaffe (read about it here) today:  After that I promised I never again will use President Barack Obama's teleprompter, and I intend to keep it that way.",Bachmann: NATO Killed 30K Libyan Civilians,Bachmann: NATO Killed ____K Libyan Civilians,30,"Paraphrase( 30,000 , K )",1

Police say the girl, who went missing on Sunday, was tracked down after her mother showed Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson screenshots of the disturbing attack on Monday afternoon and he immediately assembled a team of investigators, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Facebook was told to take the video down and investigators located the girl Tuesday morning after working  around the clock,  police say. The girl was taken to a children's hospital, where police say she's in stable condition, NBC News reports. The superintendent  was visibly upset when he saw the pictures of the girl and was dismayed when he learned that people were watching the incident live and no one called police,  a police spokesman tells the Chicago Tribune. No arrests have been announced yet, but police say they've identified several persons of interest. Reginald King, the girl's uncle, tells the Tribune that he believes the attackers were part of a 50-strong gang of teen boys, known as the  beam team,  that has been terrorizing the girl's Lawndale neighborhood.

Laurel Zuckerman is the great-grandniece of German Jewish businessman Paul Leffmann, who sold the 1904-5 work The Actor for $13,200, the Times of Israel reports. Leffmann and his wife had fled Nazi Germany for Fascist Italy the previous year. According to a lawsuit filed in New York on Friday, they sold the Picasso they had bought in 1912 at a discount to fund their escape to Switzerland. It was donated to the Met in 1952 by Chrysler heiress Thelma Foy. A lawyer for Zuckerman, who administers the Leffmann estate, says the painting  is tainted by the history of the Holocaust, and the Leffmanns, given the circumstances under which they sold it, never lost title,  Reuters reports. The New York Times reports that the museum says it has  indisputable title  to the painting and will fight the lawsuit. The museum says the price dealers in Paris paid for the Picasso was fair market value at the time and notes that the Leffmanns, who settled in Switzerland after the war, reclaimed some of the property they had been forced to sell but did not make a claim on the painting.

DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack said his six-month review firmed up an alibi and convinced him it was a  manifest impossibility  that Jack McCullough could have been anywhere near the area when Maria Ridulph disappeared in the small community of Sycamore. The girl vanished on Dec. 3, 1957, and was found dead several months later. The slaying remained a mystery for decades before McCullough, who was initially cleared in the case, was charged in 2011. McCullough, now 75, was a neighbor at the time of the killing. He was found guilty in 2012 after a renewed push to solve the case, and sentenced to life in prison. New evidence included recently subpoenaed phone records proving that McCullough made a collect call to his parents from a phone booth in the city of Rockford, about 35 miles from Sycamore, just minutes after the abduction took place. Testimony that the abduction had taken place earlier has been discredited, Schmack said, meaning there was no possibility McCullough could have committed the crime and driven to Rockford in time to place that call.  I know there are people who will never believe that he is not responsible for the crime,  Schmack said in a statement.  But I cannot allow that to sway me from my sworn duty.

Up to a third of restaurant and grocery-store seafood is labeled incorrectly, the Washington Post reports. Looking at specific varieties, the figures get even starker: Some 94% of so-called tuna in New York wasn't, the New York Times reports, while 87% of snapper is mislabeled.  Even a relatively educated consumer couldn’t look at a whole fish and say, ‘I’m sure that’s a red snapper and not lane snapper,’   says the study's lead author. The study follows up on a smaller one released in December by activist group Oceana. Overall, Southern California had the worst labeling record, with 52% of its fish marked wrong. And the worst venue for wrong labels: sushi restaurants, the study found, at a 95% rate. In many cases, sushi joints called escolar—or albacore canned tuna— white tuna.  Too much of it can cause diarrhea. Odds for consumers are best at grocery stores, where 27% of the products are mislabeled. In many cases, cheaper fish took the place of more expensive ones.

Foued Mohamed-Aggad left Strasbourg for Syria in late 2013, a French judicial official said, at a time when a group of about a dozen young men from the eastern city left for the war zone. Some returned of their own will—including his brother—telling investigators they were disgusted by what they had seen. All are charged with terror-related offenses and face trial. The Frenchman believed to have recruited them, Mourad Fares, is also under arrest. All the Nov. 13 attackers identified so far have been from France or Belgium, but there is still identification work for the police to do. One of the attackers, who was killed Nov. 18 in a police raid on a hideout, remains entirely unidentified. Two of the suicide bombers at the French national stadium carried Syrian passports that are believed to be fake.  What is important is that the investigation is progressing, that the accomplices are found out, that arrests happen,  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Wednesday.

"(Feb 4, 2011  8:46 AM) Last year saw the most military foreclosures since 2003, despite efforts from Veterans Affairs to counsel and assist floundering servicemen. More than 20,000 active-duty troops, reservists, and veterans who’d taken out special government-backed mortgages lost their homes last year, the USA Today reports, and foreclosure filings in the zip codes surrounding US military bases shot up 32% over 2008—compared to 23% for the rest of the country. Military families have been hit hard by the housing crisis, since they must relocate so often. Reservists have also found civilian jobs hard to come by when they return from service. VA mortgage counselors say they helped 66,000 more families stave off foreclosure last year.  The 20,000 could have been much higher without that help,  one official says.","20K Troops, Vets Lost Their Homes Last Year","____K Troops, Vets Lost Their Homes Last Year",20,"Paraphrase( 20,000 , K )",1
"(Oct 7, 2013  8:24 AM CDT) Japan Airlines is buying its first-ever jets from Airbus in a deal with a list value of $9.5 billion. The purchase of 31 A350 planes deals a blow to US rival Boeing, which had been JAL's star supplier for decades. Airbus Chief Executive and President Fabrice Bregier and Japan Airlines President Yoshiharu Ueki signed the deal today in Tokyo, which includes an option for JAL to buy 25 more Airbus planes. Ueki said the decision to turn to Airbus, based in France, for replacements for retiring Boeing 777 jets was unrelated to the problems that have plagued Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. Ueki repeatedly said the A350 was chosen because it was the  best match for our needs.  Lately the Airbus-Boeing battle has focused on sales of the next generation of long-range, wide-bodied jets. In that matchup, today's order represents a big blow landed by Airbus A350. JAL may also have its eyes on Airbus' even bigger jet, the A380, as a future buy for use on lucrative routes such as those to Asia.  JAL wants out of its commitment for the 787 with all its problems,  says an aviation analyst.  So JAL has been switching gears and moving to Airbus.

"(Mar 24, 2020  9:00 AM CDT) Colorado has become the 22nd state to abolish the death penalty, which it hasn't used since 1997. Forty-four years after capital punishment was reinstated in the Centennial State, Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill Monday banning its use— consistent with the recognition that the death penalty cannot be, and never has been, administered equitably in the State of Colorado —while at the same time commuting the sentences of three men on death row. Robert Ray, Sir Mario Owens, and Nathan Dunlap, all  despicable and guilty,  according to Polis, will now spend life in prison without the possibility of parole.  While I understand that some victims agree with my decision and others disagree, I hope this decision provides clarity and certainty for them moving forward,  Polis said, per NBC News. Apparently not for State Sen. Rhonda Fields. Ray was convicted of orchestrating the murders of Fields' 22-year-old son and his fiancee, who were witnesses to another murder.  In a stroke of a pen Gov. Polis hijacks justice and undermines our criminal justice system,  said Fields. George Brauchler, who heads the largest district attorney's office in the state, said Polis had opted to  bury this horrendous decision  amid a pandemic, reports the Colorado Sun. Yet a Gallup poll from October showed 56% of respondents favored the death penalty while 42% were opposed.

"(Nov 20, 2014  10:04 PM) Five prisoners have been released from Guantanamo Bay as part of a renewed effort to close the detention center, officials say. Three men were sent to Georgia and two to Slovakia for resettlement. They were among dozens of low-level prisoners at Guantanamo that an administration task force in 2009 deemed to no longer pose a threat. The release of the men, four Yemenis and a Tunisian, brings the prison population to 143, around 100 fewer than when President Obama took office vowing to close the center. Obama's vow to close Guantanamo was thwarted by Congress, which prohibited sending any prisoner to the US and imposed restrictions that brought releases to a halt. Congress eased the transfer restrictions last December, and releases have resumed. A number of resettlements are expected in the coming weeks. US State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners, and he praises Georgia and Slovakia.  We are very grateful to our partners for these generous humanitarian gestures,  he says.

Eighteen of the men were part of the Granite Mountain Hotshots crew from Prescott, reports the Arizona Republic. An additional crew member wasn't with his team and survived; the deaths wiped out 20% of the town's firefighting-force.  It's a dark day,  Arizona State Forestry spokesman Mike Reichling told the Republic.

The firefighters had deployed their emergency fire shelters, tent-like structures that the Republic describes  as a last resort to withstand the fire as it blows over.  Officials say some of the dead were found in their shelters, while others were outside of them. The Prescott fire chief says of the shelters,  there's usually only sometimes a 50% chance that they survive.  The Yarnell Hill Fire, which began Friday afternoon about 80 miles northwest of Phoenix after a lightning strike and has now spread to 8,000 acres, is expected to destroy about half of the town's 500 homes, authorities said.

The last imprisoned members of the  Cuban Five  spy ring were freed this week in a sweeping deal that included the liberation of American contractor Alan Gross and a Cuban spy for the US from their jail cells in Cuba, and pledges to restore full diplomatic relations between the two nations.

Those four companies: Moderna, AstraZeneca, Inovio, and Pfizer/BioNTech. Dr. Anthony Fauci says this volunteer surge has made him  optimistic  about conducting the trials sooner rather than later.  This is what we call medical heroes,  Sarah Hasan, a recruiter for a Houston clinic, tells KHOU.  The interest we're seeing right now is on a whole different level.  Volunteers go through a rigorous application procedure, including signing a consent form that can be up to 100 pages long. Half of the participants will receive the potential vaccine, while the other half will get a placebo—another reason plenty of volunteers are needed.  A lot of people drop out right there,  UC San Francisco epidemiology professor Robert Hiatt tells USA Today.  They say, 'No, I don't want it if I don't get the vaccine.  For those who fear a vaccine may be rushed, a Harvard public health professor tries to ease those concerns.  The guidelines for these trials are really clear,  says immunologist Barry Bloom.  They will be scientifically rigorous and there are no shortcuts.  For example, one of the requirements before a clinical trial can move on to phase 3 is that the testing has to go well in animal trials. While finding volunteers for such a large clinical trial is typically a monthslong endeavor, Hiatt sees a difference this time:  The altruistic aspect of this is appealing. People want to be part of the cure.

As she told Lucian Johnston that on the car ride over Sunday, explaining he could no longer live with them due to his behavior, a police report says the 20-year-old became enraged and started stabbing both her and her husband with a knife. That's when his 12-year-old half-brother stepped in, NBC News reports: The boy, whom Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez calls a  real hero,  managed to grab the knife from Johnston and throw it out the car window, per authorities. Gonzalez says the boy likely saved his great-grandparents' lives. The great-grandma, 92, and great-grandpa, 76, were treated for stabbing injuries to the neck and head, but both have been released. Meanwhile, Johnston allegedly fled the scene, but he was arrested Monday when he returned to the home of the friend where he was originally being dropped off. He's charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The great-grandfather told authorities he believes he and his wife would have been killed if not for the 12-year-old.  What I did was I grabbed him from behind. I pulled him backwards trying to get him away from Grandma,  the boy, who gives his name only as Sacha, tells ABC13.  But I did grab the knife. I held that to his neck also. He bent back my finger, which is still sore right now. He head-butted me, which I have a loose tooth from that, but I do not really care.","Boy, 12, Saves Day When Brother Starts Stabbing Great-Grandparents","Boy, ____, Saves Day When Brother Starts Stabbing Great-Grandparents",12,Copy( 12 ),0

Today is indeed believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday, but it's unclear whether he's 31, 32, or 33. Kim's birth year, per the South Korean government, was likely 1982, 1983, or 1984. And while Yonhap reports that China sent him birthday wishes, USA Today notes there is no elaborate public celebration to mark the day, as was the case with his father's and grandfather's birthdays.  There's a lot of speculation why that's the case,  a South Korean professor tells CNN.  Kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy,  or he could just be trying to downplay the fact that he's young.  When you start marking his birthday, then the whole North Korean people will start to wonder, then what's his age?  USA Today speculates that when his age is finally revealed, 1982 will be the year named, perhaps regardless of whether that's the truth: His grandfather was born in 1912, and his father 30 years later.

The PA Media news agency reports Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, 45, not only put in for that decree—which CNN notes can either be used to prevent a forced marriage or offer assistance to someone in a forced marriage—but also for a non-molestation order for herself, as well as a request for wardship of her two kids with 70-year-old Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, who's also the UAE's vice president and prime minister. Princess Haya reportedly first fled to Germany months ago from the UAE, then landed in the UK, where it's believed she'll want to stay. Princess Haya is said to have ditched her husband after learning  disturbing facts  about the return of Sheikha Latifa, an adult daughter of the sheikh by another wife, per the BBC. Latifa's sister Shama also tried to leave the UAE, in 2000; she was brought back, though it's not clear what her current status is. Even though a joint statement earlier this month from Princess Haya and the sheikh noted the hearing was on  the welfare of the two children of their marriage and [did] not concern divorce or finances,  it's widely believed she's seeking to leave him for good. After Princess Haya, the daughter of Jordan's late King Hussein, got out of the UAE, the sheikh is said to have uploaded an  angry poem accusing an unnamed woman of betrayal and treachery,  the BBC notes.

Now, the New Yorker is reporting that Guilfoyle—chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee and the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr.—was forced out before Fox paid upward of $4 million to her accuser, a female assistant. In a draft complaint sent to company executives in November 2018, the unidentified woman claimed she was forced to work from and sleep at Guilfoyle's New York apartment, where the host would expose her naked body, talk incessantly of her sex life, and showcase lewd photos of men with whom she'd been intimate. Guilfoyle also allegedly told her assistant to submit to a Fox employee's demands for sexual favors and asked for a massage of her bare thighs, according to people familiar with the complaint, which is subject to a nondisclosure agreement. Per the New Yorker, the assistant also claimed Guilfoyle offered up to $1 million in hush money and other favors around August 2017 if the woman agreed to lie to lawyers hired to investigate sexual misconduct at the network. Those lawyers had begun looking at claims the same assistant made against host Eric Bolling, whom the woman also served. Bolling, who's denied wrongdoing, left Fox in September 2017.

"(Sep 14, 2020  7:38 AM CDT) Three humpback whales made a wrong turn in Australia and ended up in a place where whales have never been seen before: a muddy, bendy river. That's bad. A little worse is that the river is named the East Alligator River, for good reason, reports the BBC. Two of the whales are believed to have made it back to open water—it's also possible they're just staying underwater—and scientists are now trying to figure out how to coax the last one to safety, reports the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The whale is about 18 miles inland now in Kakadu, and wildlife officials may use whale calls or loud, underwater noises to discourage it from going further inland.  It’s never occurred before, we’ve had no records of this in the past,  says marine scientist Carol Palmer.  We’ve collaborated with the traditional owners of East Alligator River, and they’ve also never seen humpback whales in any of the alligator rivers.  As its name suggests, the river is infested with crocs and alligators, though authorities think the whale is probably safe as long as it's able to keep swimming. If it becomes beached, however,  it's an easy feed  for the crocs, says Palmer.

Doug Symiczek had planned to take his two sons-in-law, Kyle Parton and Jacob Griffiths, on a quick morning flight to a cafe near California's Corona Airport and then head back to Lake Elsinore to go boating. But their plane, a 1967 Piper PA28 that Symiczek has owned for more than two decades, turned sharply, hit a tree, and crashed into the mountains above the lake, according to witnesses. All three men died in the July 6 crash, reports the Press-Enterprise.

If he hadn’t hit the tree, they would have landed safely. It’s such a freak accident.  Authorities say an initial report will be released soon, but that it could take a year to determine the cause of the crash. Symiczek and his wife Kim were about to celebrate their 30-year wedding anniversary, while Parton and his wife Breanna were expecting a baby girl that very day; Griffiths' wife Amanda is three months along with their first child. Griffiths' stepmother tells the OC Register that the couple had taken baby announcement photos the day before the crash.

"(Jan 1, 2011  10:03 AM) Today is more than just New Year’s Day for the oldest of the baby boomers: It’s also their 65th birthday.  The generation that once sang of teaching the world to sing in perfect harmony, and then buying it a Coke,  writes Dan Barry in the New York Times, is now retiring, eating early bird specials, and wearing Velcro shoes … or not. The truth is,  many of them, whether through exercise or Botox, have no intention of ceding to others what they consider rightfully theirs: youth.  Every year for the next 19 years, about 10,000 people per day will become senior citizens—and, as they’ve done with other milestones before this, baby boomers will be  redefining what it means to be older  as they live and work longer. One reason they’re so determined to hang on to youth? The generation known as the  pig in the python  is actually  pretty glum  about the way life turned out, says a Pew Center exec, noting a recent survey.  The pig has moved through the python, and is moving to the final stage,  says one author.  And we won’t describe what that stage is.

"(Jul 24, 2019  7:11 AM CDT) Neil Armstrong's family received $6 million to settle a wrongful death claim after experts said the astronaut's Aug. 25, 2012 death may have been preventable. The news is only now being reported by the New York Times, which received documents relating to the settlement from an anonymous sender, as Cincinnati's Mercy Health-Fairfield Hospital  insisted on keeping the complaints and the settlement secret.  Armstrong had experienced significant bleeding as temporary wires used to pace his heartbeat were removed following coronary bypass surgery. Experts would later question why he was taken to a catheterization lab, where blood was drained from his heart, rather than directly to an operating room. One surgeon who reviewed the case for the hospital described it as a risky decision. Afterward,  the patient became unsalvageable on the way to the OR.  Armstrong's sons, Mark and Rick, alleged incompetent care. In a July 2014 email to the hospital's lawyers, Mark's wife, lawyer Wendy Armstrong, noted the brothers had been  solicited by several book writers and filmmakers for 'information about Neil that no one already knows'  and were about to speak at a public ceremony in honor of the moon landing.  No institution wants to be remotely associated with the death of one of America's greatest heroes,  added a lawyer for Armstrong's grandchildren. She noted  the entire payment must be repaid in full  if the case is  ever revealed by the parties to the agreement.  Mark and Rick split nearly $5.2 million, per the Times. Armstrong's brother and sister each received $250,000, while six grandchildren each received $24,000. Armstrong's widow, Carol, told the Times she signed off on the settlement as executor but otherwise wasn't involved.  I want that for the record,  she said.","Neil Armstrong's Family Alleged Wrongful Death, Got $6M","Neil Armstrong's Family Alleged Wrongful Death, Got $____M",6,Copy( 6 ),0
"(Jul 3, 2014  10:29 AM CDT) You might think that giving a green light to Edward Snowden and Aaron Alexis and allegedly fraudulently submitting 660,000 other background checks without actually completing them would prevent you from getting future government contracts. But you'd be wrong, because the Department of Homeland Security has awarded a $190 million contract to US Investigations Services, the Wall Street Journal reports. Why? Because USIS hasn't actually been suspended, and, as one immigration official explained, unless there is such a suspension in place,  by law and policy, we have to go with the lowest bidder.  USIS isn't barred, the Office of Personnel Management says, because it has taken steps to deal with  actions by their employees and previous leadership.  Then again, in 2012 the OPM's inspector general warned that the OPM lacked a strong suspension and disbarment system for contractors—and particularly for contractors performing background checks. However, the inspector general did say yesterday that the agency has bolstered those efforts in the past year.

Soon he was pitching himself as a Senate candidate to all of Wisconsin’s conservative radio stations.

A new study suggests that air pollution in Asia results in more erratic, intense winter storms over North America, reports CNN. The culprit is the huge increase in aerosol emissions in Asia amid its industrial boom, say the scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The result is stronger storms in the northwest Pacific Ocean, with North America feeling the biggest effects, reports LiveScience.  The increasing pollution in Asian countries is not just a local problem, it can affect other parts of the world,  says a NASA atmospheric scientist who is the study's lead author. Another scientist on the team explains in broad terms how the chain effect works in the Guardian:  Mid-latitude storms develop off Asia and they track across the Pacific, coming in to the west coast of the US.  The aerosol  particles in this model are affecting how strong those storms are, how dense the clouds are, and how much rainfall comes out of those storms.

Not that DiGiulian's an amateur. She's been climbing since she was 6 and nabbed top honors in national and world rock-climbing championships, CBS notes.

"(Jul 17, 2020  4:05 PM CDT) Another 14,780 new coronavirus cases Friday put Texas among the hardest-hit states in the nation. Along with California, Florida, and New York, Texas now has more than 300,000 confirmed cases, NBC News reports. The Friday total was a one-day record for Texas. In anticipation of the death toll climbing, funeral homes are stocking up on body bags, and FEMA has dispatched 14 more refrigerated trucks—making 22 altogether. A report for the White House Coronavirus Task Force lists 123 Texas counties in the  red zone,  per KXAS, meaning they have more than 100 cases per 100,000 people. Stricter safety measures could follow as a result. The number of coronavirus cases and the number of positive tests for the most recent weekly period in Texas were twice the national average. Texas education officials told schools Friday they don't have to require students to attend classes in person for the first four weeks of the school year if they don't want to. Another four-week waiver would be available after that, per the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The state teachers union said that's not enough.  Irrelevant deadlines are not what educators and students need,  its president said.  Educators, students and their parents need assurance that school buildings will not be reopened until it is safe to do so.  Houston and Dallas schools already had decided to delay reopening for in-person classes. A  Return to Learn  survey of parents reported finding that 83% want their children to return in person; the difference was much closer to an even split in Arlington and Fort Worth.

Anyone visiting any of the three states from places that are considered coronavirus hot spots will have to quarantine for 14 days, the BBC reports.  We worked very hard to get the viral transmission down,  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. He made the announcement in a press conference with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, per WNBC.  The last thing we need to do right now is to subject our folks to another round,  Murphy said. The requirement takes effect Thursday. A total of more than 41,000 people in the three states have died in the pandemic, but New York's fatalities have dropped from nearly 800 a day to fewer than 30. The order will apply to anyone coming from a state in which 10 of every 100,000 people test positive on a rolling seven-day basis, or a state where 10% of the population has tested positive for the virus. As of now, Cuomo said, those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah, and Texas. The list will be updated, he said. Florida, Texas and Arizona are among the states posting their highest rates of the pandemic. Hotels will have to inform guests of the rule, and signs will be posted in airports and along roads. In New York, the penalty for a first violation of the rule is a $2,000 fine, per CNN.

Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts involving sex assaults on 102 girls and a boy. The new charges, including rape and continuous sexual abuse, involve 24 other girls. Some of his victims were just months old, according to authorities. One investigator called the assaults  the most brutal on a child I have ever seen.

But even now, questions remain about its toll: Almost 400 bodies, for instance, are in numbered coffins in Thailand, and 369 of them haven't even been identified, Reuters reports—even after what's considered a heroic effort by the Thai Tsunami Victim Identification unit. The coffins are now in the a village cemetery near the district of Takua Pa, in the country's south.

Most of the unclaimed bodies are thought to be the remains of Burmese people, and only 26 have been identified.

Reform itself, the CBO has said, would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over a decade. Moreover, the CBO finds, repeal would cut the number of Americans with health insurance in 2019 by some 32 million, Politico reports. Repeal would also drive up prices for people who bought insurance in the individual market, the analysis says. But the new House speaker, who was delivered a copy of the report yesterday, disagrees, notes the New York Times.

The group's Yemen branch, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has confirmed that its leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, was killed in a strike last week, reports the Washington Post. Wuhayshi, who was reportedly groomed by Osama bin Laden, became al-Qaeda's No. 2 leader when he took charge of the highly active—and dangerous—Yemen franchise in 2013. He was filmed calling for attacks on the US at a large gathering of militants last year.  We must eliminate the cross,  he said, and  the bearer of the cross is America.  The SITE Intelligence Group describes the death as the biggest strike on al-Qaeda since the 2011 killing of bin Laden, the BBC reports. The possible death of the leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Libya in a US airstrike over the weekend makes this a very bad week for the group's leadership, former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel tells the Post.

Researchers studying the Greenland shark estimate the oldest of their 28 specimens is 392 years old, give or take 120 years, Science reports. They tell NPR they're 95% sure Greenland sharks live between 272 and 512 years. That would make the sharks the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, according to Time. The bowhead whale was the previous record holder, living up to 211 years, so even 272 years is a massively long lifespan. The shocked researchers published their findings Thursday. Researchers deduced the shark's age by carbon dating its eyes. National Geographic reports the Greenland shark hadn't been heavily studied in the past due to living in the remote North Atlantic and being hard to find. A geneticist believes the cold water in the sharks' home is responsible for their long lives, slowing their metabolic rates and turning on an anti-aging gene. Meanwhile a biologist specializing in aging is suddenly interested in studying the Greenland shark.  There's something going on in those muscles,  he tells NPR.

The Telegraph says two sources IDed the man as Walter Palmer, a Minnesota dentist, and the Independent says the chairman of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force has confirmed that. Palmer, who's believed to have paid up to $55,000 to kill Cecil with a bow and arrow, is a well-known hunter who's been featured in the New York Times (which noted he learned to shoot at age 5) and on at least one hunting blog that shows him holding up various big game he's killed, including a 175-pound leopard and a California bighorn sheep. The Independent notes that the bio on Palmer's dental practice's website, which is currently down, lists him as enjoying  outdoor activities  and that  anything allowing him to stay active and observe and photograph wildlife is where you will find Dr. Palmer when he [is] not in the office.  Palmer has also racked up legal troubles involving his hunting hobby, per the 2009 Times article: He pleaded guilty in 2008 to making a false statement to the feds about the site where he killed a black bear during a guided hunt. And while shooting and killing lions with a bow and arrow is legal in Zimbabwe (though not in a national park), the professional hunter who guided Palmer and the owner of the private land where Cecil was killed  had no permit or quota to justify the offtake of the lion and therefore are liable for the illegal hunt,  a statement from the Zimbabwe national parks authority reads, per the Telegraph. The ZCTF chairman tells the Independent that those convicted in the illegal hunt could face 10 years in prison and that the lion's  head—[Palmer's] trophy—has been impounded and confiscated as evidence for the court.

According to a study published in Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences, people turning an age that ends in 9 are more likely to take up positive habits, but they may also cheat on their mates and even be more apt to commit suicide, the Washington Post reports. That's because the approaching round-numbered ages (e.g., the big 3-0 or 4-0) are  psychologically consequential  and cause us to take a long, hard look at what we've been doing up to that point and recalibrate, Hal Hershfield, one of the study's co-authors, tells the Post. People want a do-over when they hit certain temporal landmarks like birthdays or New Year's Day—what a study published in Management Science calls the  fresh start effect.  In the new research, scientists analyzed six studies and found that people the Post refers to as  nine-enders  are more likely to question how meaningful their lives are, and are more likely to increase both constructive and destructive behaviors, the NYU Stern School of Business reports. Men who were 29, 39, 49, and 59, for example, were more likely to register on an extramarital affair-focused website, while suicide rates for nine-enders were 2.4% higher than for others. On the flip side, first-time marathon runners were more likely to have an age ending in 9 (25%), and runners who were 29 and 39 had a 2% faster running rate than they did two years before and after those ages.

The Army sergeant was released as part of a deal brokered by Qatar that also freed five detainees at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, reports the Washington Post. US officials say the 28-year-old seems to be in good health and was able to walk, but was under the care of military doctors. President Obama personally delivered the news to his parents and in a statement said his release  is a reminder of America’s unwavering commitment to leave no man or woman in uniform behind on the battlefield.  Bergdahl, believed to have been held by the Taliban offshoot Haqqani network, was turned over to US special-ops forces at an unspecified location. The five Gitmo detainees were being transferred to Qatar and will have a one-year travel ban among other security restrictions, reports the New York Times.",Taliban Frees US Hostage Held Since 2009,Taliban Frees US Hostage Held Since ____,2009,Copy( 2009 ),0

Henry Allingham, who became the world's oldest man after the death of a Japanese 113-year-old last month, passed away peacefully at a care home for veterans. Politicians and veterans' groups paid tribute to Allingham, who was highly active in keeping memories of the war alive and whose mind remained sharp until the end. Allingham, whose dynasty includes 14 great-great grandchildren and one great-great-great grandchild, once quipped that his longevity was due to  cigarettes, whisky, and wild, wild women.  Others put it down to sheer determination.  He was a very dignified, very gentle man,  one historian who knew Allingham says.

"(Jan 28, 2013  8:31 AM) Next month's college loan payment might be even more of a bitter pill to swallow: A new study out today finds that almost half of all working Americans with college degrees are overqualified for their jobs. In 2010, 5% of all janitors, 15% of cab drivers, and 25% of retail sales clerks held bachelor's degrees, USA Today reports. In all, 48% of working college grads had jobs in 2010 that did not require a bachelor's degree, and 37% had jobs that only required a high school diploma, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Being underemployed  is almost the new normal,  the lead author says, and the trend is likely to continue over the next 10 years. Why? The number of college graduates is much higher than the number of jobs requiring a college degree—and the disparity is getting worse since the number of grads is increasing. The number of Americans with bachelor's degrees jumped 25% between 2002 and 2012, to 41.7 million, according to Census Bureau stats ... but in 2010, only 28.6 million jobs required such a degree.",48% Chance You're Overqualified for Your Job,____% Chance You're Overqualified for Your Job,48,Copy( 48 ),0
"(Feb 23, 2016  5:33 AM) It's  extremely likely  that sea levels rose faster in the 20th century than at any other time in the previous 2,700 years  and the rise over the last two decades has been even faster,  scientists say. A new study—based on  reconstructions  of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges—finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, reports USA Today.  We can say with 95% probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,  the lead author tells the Washington Post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100—if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which  is hypothesized to be already underway.  There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say. If not for humans, sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal  nuisance  floods in the US would have been avoided, according to Climate Central.

"(Apr 14, 2015  3:55 AM CDT) A notebook that sheds light on how British mathematician Alan Turing helped invent modern computing—and win World War II—was sold for just over $1 million at an auction in New York yesterday. The 56-page handwritten notebook dates from 1942, when Turing was helping crack Nazi Germany's Enigma code and turn the tide of the war, reports Reuters. Bonhams auction house, which sold an Enigma machine for $269,000 at the same auction, says a portion of the proceeds will go to charity and adds that the sale is a  wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy,  the Telegraph reports. The auction house says Turing's notes show how he was  working on logic and the foundations of mathematics with the aim of creating a universal language for a universal computing machine.  Turing, who reportedly committed suicide in 1954, left the notebook to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy, who used the blank pages for a dream journal and some deeply personal messages, the Financial Times reports.  It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited,  wrote Gandy, who died in 1995.

I'm not sure she appreciated the gravity of what she did,  says the police chief in Wickliffe, Ohio, per the AP. The 11-year-old's mother, 39—a friend of the mom of 2-month-old Zuri Whitehead, who was watching the infant to give her mom a break—fell asleep on a basement couch with both girls around 3am Friday, reports the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. In the hour the mother was asleep, the girl allegedly took Zuri upstairs and beat her. She returned and woke her mother to tell her something was wrong with the baby, who was bleeding with her head badly swollen. The mother immediately called 911, but Zuri died of massive brain injuries and internal bleeding at a Cleveland trauma center. The 11-year-old, who is not being named, was charged with murder yesterday; a juvenile court judge entered a not guilty plea and ordered a competency hearing. The child is too young to be charged as an adult. The crime scene was so traumatic that the police chief is bringing in counselors for responding officers.

The incident began when security opened fire on three inmates trying to escape al-Kweifiya prison, the AP reports. Other prisoners began rioting and setting fires. When their relatives on the outside heard what was going on, they began firing rifles at the facility. Exactly how many escaped amidst the violence seems to be in question, but some say as high as 1,200 fled. Among those who escaped were a small number of Gadhafi supporters, the BBC reports. A government official says 18 escapees have already been arrested, while others returned voluntarily. The three inmates who originally tried to break out are in hospital with injuries.

But Price, the owner of a credit-card payment processing company, didn't just read about the study: He decided to put it into action. Yesterday, he told his 120 employees at Gravity Payments in Seattle that over the next three years, he'll gradually raise salaries until everyone in the company is making at least $70,000. It wasn't just the article that convinced him to make his move: He spoke to friends who  walk[ed] me through the math of making 40 grand a year,  he tells the New York Times, and what they said about rent increases and credit card debt  just eats at me inside.  He wanted to put his plan into action without an increase in price or a decrease in service for his customers, so he plans to pay for the salary increases by using up 75% to 80% of the company's profits this year—and by cutting his own salary from almost $1 million to, yes, $70,000. And there it will stay until the company gets back to the same level of profit it had before he made this change, he says. Currently, the average salary at Gravity Payments, which Price founded in 2004 as a 19-year-old Seattle Pacific University student, is $48,000; as part of Price's plan, about 70 employees will see their wages increase—30 will actually see their wages double. It's not the first time Price has made a similar move: In 2013, when a 2% payroll tax increase went into effect, he responded by giving all his employees making less than $100,000 a 2% raise, GeekWire reports.","Entrepreneur Reads Study, Will Pay All Workers $70K","Entrepreneur Reads Study, Will Pay All Workers $____K",70,"Paraphrase( 70,000 , K )",1

In an effort to gain insight into how Karen Kraushaar responded to workplace conflict, the AP takes a look into the past of the 55-year-old Kraushaar, who has now stepped into the spotlight by publicly calling for all Cain's accusers to step forward. Kraushaar's 2002 claim alleged unfair treatment after her supervisors at the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused to let her work from home after a car accident; it also cited a sexist email forward that a supervisor circulated at work that listed reasons men and women were like computers (in the case of men,  you have to turn them on  to get their attention). The complaint was handled internally, but Kraushaar initially sought thousands of dollars, a reinstated leave, a promotion worth $12,000 to $16,000 annually, and a Harvard fellowship, according to an anonymous INS supervisor. Kraushaar says she doesn't remember seeking payment, and later took a job at Treasury and dropped the complaint, which she calls  relatively minor.

The Vanzolini bald-faced saki, a distinctive  flying monkey  that sports shaggy hair with golden highlights around its arms and legs, hadn't been seen since 1936, when it was spotted in an isolated part of the Brazilian Amazon along the border of Peru. (Dead specimens were collected 20 years later in another expedition, notes Gizmodo.) Led by Global Conservation Institute Director Laura Marsh, a team set out to find the elusive primate on a four-month expedition of the Eiru River in a cramped, two-story houseboat. Just four days into the journey, Marsh says she saw three Vanzolini saki high in the trees and immediately burst into tears.  It was fantastic,  she tells National Geographic.  I was trembling and so excited I could barely take a picture.  A journalist accompanying the team documented the highs and lows of the research trip in a stunning bioGraphic photo essay. She noted that during the expedition, the team learned that a graduate student doing field research nearby obtained a skull and skins from a hunter and, scooping the very title the team had hoped to use, published a paper titled  Rediscovery of Vanzolini’s Bald-Faced Saki.  But the team continued its research and plans to publish its findings in the journal Oryx later this month. As for the fate of the living Vanzolini saki population, Marsh believes conservation is key in even the most remote reaches of the rain forest.  Fishing and hunting in every little corner.

His exploits in the SOE included parachuting into France more than once, blowing up railroad tracks, escaping from the Nazis via a stolen limousine, smuggling explosives via hollowed-out loaves of bread, and fleeing the Nazis once again while wearing a nun's habit. He also once escaped the Germans by faking a seizure, felling his guard with a table leg, and breaking his neck before shooting two other guards with the first guard's pistol.

Switzerland’s second-largest bank suspended the traders and said it would review 2007 earnings. Markets, already skeptical about the health of the financial industry, reacted negatively. Yesterday a Qatar sovereign wealth fund announced it had bought a stake in Credit Suisse, which earlier announced $1.8 billion in subprime writedowns for 2007.

CNN Money estimates that will amount to $2 million. The chain also made headlines earlier this month when it closed its stores on Election Day to encourage people to vote for a candidate who would help the environment, notes Adweek. The Black Friday idea was born in the wake of the election, with the VP of environmental activism noting that during these  divisive  times,  the environment is something we can all come together on.  Patagonia's money will be handled by One Percent for the Planet, a network of green organizations around the world.  These are small groups, often underfunded and under the radar, who work on the front lines,  says Marcario, adding the planet  badly needs a gift or two (and still gets coal every year).  Since 1985, Patagonia has donated 1% of its sales, or $74 million, to the environment, but Marcario says the need is now more urgent than ever. Meanwhile, fellow outdoors outfitter REI will stay closed on Black Friday for a second year in a row as it encourages employees to get outside, reports the Consumerist.

"(Aug 8, 2012  4:01 AM CDT) House prices had their biggest jump in years in the second quarter of 2012, mainly because of a big shortage of houses for sale, reports the Wall Street Journal. Officials from data firm CoreLogic say it was the biggest jump since 2005, while Freddie Mac, using different methodology, says the 4.8% quarter-on-quarter rise was the biggest since 2004. The number of homes for sale is down sharply from a year ago, largely because of investors snapping up cheap homes to turn into rentals, while the lowest mortgage rates in 60 years have fueled a surge in demand. The long slowdown in new home construction has added to the home shortage, as has the fact that more than 11 million homeowners are  underwater,  owing the bank more than their homes are worth. In these conditions,  only a little bit of the market is tradable because you have so much negative equity,  the chief economist at real-estate firm Zillow says.  You have very few people willing to sell homes, and a big uptick in demand can create some real price appreciation.

A commander of the elite police unit that made the arrests says the suspects, mostly students aged 20-30 years, had traveled from across the country and were picked up in a raid on a community center at Keraniganj, outside the nation's capital, early Friday.

According to KERO, Logan is recovering after traveling across the country to California to have a 130-pound growth removed from his abdomen. (The Californian says it was 140 pounds.)

The US is falling behind much of the world when it comes to improving and expanding its transportation network, and now lags behind Brazil, China, and India, a new study by the Urban Land Institute finds. One stark example: In the US, the FAA’s funding bill expired in 2007 and has been extended 18 times, while in China, $1 trillion will be spent on high-speed rail, highways, and more infrastructure projects in five years. The yawning chasm between highways and water treatment plants nearing obsolescence and Congress' desire to hack spending will push costs onto cash-strapped localities, the Washington Post reports. The report sees a future in which US cities abandon services and let rural roads return to nature. Eventually, it concludes, taxes, tolls, and water bills will increase and private companies will play a larger role in public projects. A panel of 80 experts looked into the same issues last fall, concluding that the US must spend as much as $262 billion a year on highways, rail networks, and air transport.",US Needs to Plow $2T Into Infrastructure,US Needs to Plow $____T Into Infrastructure,2,Copy( 2 ),0

Consumerist calls it a new record; Andrew calls it  delicious.  And that, he tells Consumerist via email, was the intention. He says he was aiming to beat the record set last year: a $47.30 frap with a mere 40 shots and a long list of additives (from mocha drizzle to caramel brulee topping to strawberries) that raised the price while seriously lowering the taste.

The multi-billion-dollar purchase could speed the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, but neighboring nations may worry about the presence of such powerful weaponry in a still-shaky country. Lockheed Martin’s F-16s would be the most advanced weapons Iraq has yet bought. The request for the planes  represents yet another reflection of Maliki's growing confidence in his government and the Iraqi security forces,  says an analyst.

Ex-wife Priscilla and their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, joined fans from around the world for a cake-cutting ceremony outside Elvis' longtime Memphis home. They also sang  Happy Birthday  in 15-degree weather. Elvis was born Jan. 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi. He moved to Memphis with his parents at age 13, and died Aug. 16, 1977, in Memphis at age 42. An auction of Elvis-related memorabilia is scheduled for this evening, and among the items will be Presley's first recording. It's an acetate he made in 1953 when he walked into Sun Records in Memphis and sang  My Happiness.  As the story goes, it was supposed to be a gift for his mom, but he left the $4 acetate at a friend's house, and it's been stored in a safe for decades now.

Per the New York Daily News, a ServiceMaster Global Holdings earnings report released Thursday first made mention of the payout  to settle all civil claims of the affected family related to the US Virgin Islands matter.  The company has already paid $3 million to cover the insurance deductible for the Esmonds, who were severely injured after Terminix workers sprayed methyl bromide—banned for indoor residential use since 1984—in the St. John condo unit below their own, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. A September CNN report documented the horrifying consequences of the neurotoxin suffered by the Esmonds. Dad Stephen Esmond could barely speak at the time, was unable to turn the pages of a book, and suffered from tremors, while his two teen sons, former athletes who were in medically induced comas for weeks after the incident, were barely able to move.  Neurologically, it's like being in a torture chamber,  a family attorney said. Mom Theresa Devine recovered more quickly and was looking after her family. (The Daily News and Inquirer note that no further word on their progress has been made available.) ServiceMaster has also agreed to pay up to $10 million in  fines, community service, and government costs  as part of the settlement, which is subject to court approval at an Aug. 25 hearing.

The storm covered the fields of the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers with white and forced the cancellation of thousands of flights across the US. The storm is slowing traffic on roads, leading to a number of accidents, including a fatal crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Morgantown that led to a series of fender-benders involving 50 cars. In that incident, a motorist involved in a minor accident stepped out of his car and was hit and killed, triggering the other crashes, NBC Philadelphia reports.

With only 227 pounds of the equipment-clogging stuff available for tests, NASA is pouring $19 million into faking it, the Wall Street Journal reports.  So many people need moon dirt, and there's just not enough to go around,  a project manager says. Scientists need moon dust for everything from basic medical tests to more outlandish experiments, but it’s more glass-like than its earthly counterpart, thanks to its unique heat-fusion formation. So every year, NASA collects 12 tons of moon-mimicking rock from a Montana mine, subjects it to 30,000-degree heat in a one-of-a-kind plasma furnace, and rips it apart with sonic booms.

NCAA President Mark Emmert said that though there was no action it could take to remove the victims' pain and suffering,  what we can do is impose sanctions that reflect the magnitude of these terrible acts.  Penn State will also have all its wins from 1998 to 2011 voided, and have its football scholarships slashed from 25 to 15 for four years, reports the Patriot-News. Current players will be able to transfer out and play immediately wherever they go, or keep their scholarships even if they leave the team.

"(Dec 24, 2020  6:24 AM) Britain has tightened lockdowns in response to a worrying new coronavirus variant—but unless it does more, 2021 may be an even deadlier year for the country than 2020, according to a new study. Researchers at the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate that the B117 variant, which carries a set of 23 mutations, is 56% more transmissible than other strains, Bloomberg reports. They say that while there is no sign B117 is deadlier than other strains of COVID-19, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are likely to surge unless the British government takes steps including closing schools and increasing the vaccination rate tenfold from the current 200,000 a week. Britain's Office for National Statistics said Friday that there has been a sharp rise in positive tests in London and the southeast of England, where the variant was first detected, the BBC reports. The ONS estimates two-thirds of people testing positive in the region could have the new variant. The variant has also been detected in countries including Denmark and Singapore, which reported its first B117 case Friday.  Unfortunately, this is another twist in the plot,  Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, tells the New York Times.  While we were all rejoicing for the vaccine, there is the possibility of a change of epidemiological context that makes our next few months much more complex and more perilous to navigate,  he says.

An unspecified engine or air duct problem forced a Los Angles-bound flight to return to Atlanta just over an hour after takeoff, where its tail scraped the ground as it dropped onto the runway. Earlier, a Moscow-bound Boeing 767 returned to JFK after losing thrust in one of its engines. A Boeing 757 also made an emergency landing at Ireland's Shannon airport on Saturday after problems developed in two of its engines en route from Philadelphia.

As an arch-atheist, Hitchens doesn’t much like the Cordoba Initiative, or any of the supposed  moderate  Muslims behind it, but he’s appalled that its opponents have resorted to a  part-pathetic and part-sinister appeal to demagogy.  From Sarah Palin to the Anti-Defamation League, opponents claim that they’re just parroting the families of 9/11 victims, and others who find the mosque offensive. This argument  borrows straight from the playbook of Muslim cultural blackmail,  Hitchens argues.

"(Jan 19, 2017  12:44 AM) A Pennsylvania mall that was foreclosed on after its owners failed to repay $143 million has been auctioned off for just $100. Wells Fargo Bank was owed the money from a 2006 loan and submitted the winning—and only bid—for the 1.1 million-square-foot Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills on Wednesday, the AP reports. The bank was acting as trustee for MSCI 2007 HQ11, the trust that bought the mall in suburban Frazer Township. Wells Fargo foreclosed last year on the mall, which opened in 2005. The mall once was worth $190 million but recently was appraised at just $11 million and is slightly more than half occupied. Analysts say that in this kind of  consensual foreclosure  situation, it's normal for there to be no other bidders. Steve Jellinek at Morningstar Credit Ratings tells the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that regional malls are struggling and lenders may find it difficult to minimize their losses.  The problem of regional malls is the loss severity tends to be higher than ones located in or near big cities,  Jellinek says, adding that it can be hard for malls to recover after they lose big tenants like Sears, which left Pittsburgh Mills in 2014.  Then you see a marked decrease in cash flow and it's harder to repurpose and refill.

In doing so, Trump might have broken anti- self-dealing  laws, which bar nonprofit leaders from using charity money toward personal expenditures or their own businesses. The settlements include a $100,000 donation Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club was supposed to make in order to get a lawsuit over $120,000 in unpaid fines dismissed; instead, the check came from the charitable Donald J. Trump Foundation, which is largely funded by donations from people other than Trump. Similarly, one of Trump's New York golf courses was supposed to make a donation to settle a lawsuit, but instead the Trump Foundation made the $158,000 donation. Smaller amounts have been used for other questionable expenses, like $10,000 from the foundation being used to buy a portrait of Trump from a charity fundraiser, or $5,000 from the foundation being used to buy ads for his hotels. If the IRS goes after Trump for self-dealing, he could be forced to reimburse the foundation and/or pay penalty taxes. He could also be in hot water with the New York attorney general, which is looking into whether any state charity laws were broken by the foundation.

"(Jul 1, 2019  1:15 PM CDT) Japanese whalers returned to port Monday with their first catch after resuming commercial whaling for the first time in 31 years, achieving the long-cherished goal of traditionalists despite slowing demand for the meat and changing views on conservation. A fleet of five boats left the northern Japanese port of Kushiro earlier Monday and brought back two minke whales, per the AP. A crane lifted them and placed them on the back of a truck to be taken to a portside factory for processing. Workers in blue plastic overalls poured sake from paper cups onto the first whale to express thanks and celebrate the first catch. It was the first commercial hunt since 1988, when Japan switched to what it called research whaling after commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission. Japan gave six months' notice that it was withdrawing from the IWC, a move that took effect Sunday. The Fisheries Agency said the hunts will stay within the country's exclusive economic zone, and the catch quota for the rest of this year will be 227 whales, fewer than the 637 that Japan hunted in the Antarctic and the northwestern Pacific in its research program in recent years. The announcement of the quota, originally planned for late June, was delayed until Monday in an apparent move to avoid criticism during this past weekend's Group of 20 summit in Osaka. Fisheries Agency officials said the whale meat will be auctioned at a local fish market Thursday and later hit stores, mainly in the region but possibly in Tokyo.

"(Sep 29, 2016  6:34 PM CDT) Deep in the Philippine jungle, a lone soldier continued to fight World War II for three decades, becoming a  figure of legend  while surviving on  bananas, coconut milk, and stolen cattle.  Mashable has the incredible true story of Japan's Hiroo Onoda. After the end of WWII on Aug. 15, 1945, planes dropped leaflets announcing the end of fighting on Lubang Island in the Philippines. A 22-year-old Onoda had been deployed to the island in 1944 with orders to never surrender or kill himself. He and three other Japanese soldiers who had survived Allied attacks believed the leaflets were a trap and continued to fight on as guerrillas, killing 30 people over the coming decades. By 1972, all three of Onoda's compatriots had either been killed or surrendered. But Onoda fought on. Norio Suzuki, a Japanese adventurer, made it his mission to find  Lieutenant Onoda, a panda, and the Abominable Snowman, in that order.  He wasn't being flippant. Suzuki would die in a Himalayan avalanche while searching for the latter. But before that, he found and befriended Onoda in the Lubang jungle. On March 9, 1974, Suzuki brought Onoda's commanding officer, by then an old man working in a bookstore, to Lubang. Onoda had required his order to stop fighting. He was pardoned by the Philippine president and returned to Japan a hero—29 years after the end of WWII. Onoda went on to teach children how to survive in the wilderness, something he was uniquely qualified for.

"(Jun 12, 2014  12:58 PM CDT) Ruby Dee, an acclaimed actor and civil rights activist whose versatile career spanned stage, radio television, and film, has died at age 91. Dee, who frequently acted alongside her husband of 56 years, Ossie Davis, was surrounded by family and friends at her home in New Rochelle, NY. Her long career brought her an Oscar nomination at age 83 for best supporting actress for her role in the 2007 film American Gangster. She also won an Emmy and was nominated for several others. Since meeting on Broadway in 1946, she and her late husband were frequent collaborators, but they were more than a performing couple. They were also activists who fought for civil rights, particularly for blacks.  We used the arts as part of our struggle,  she said in 2006. As young performers, they found themselves caught up in the debate over social and racial justice in the United States, and their push for social justice was lifelong: In 1999, the couple was arrested while protesting the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, by New York City police. They were friends with baseball star Jackie Robinson and his wife, Rachel—Dee played her, opposite Robinson himself, in the 1950 movie The Jackie Robinson Story—and with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Dee and Davis served as masters of ceremonies for the 1963 March on Washington, and she spoke at the funerals for both King and Malcolm X. Among her best-known films was A Raisin in the Sun in 1961, and she also had a role in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing in 1989. On television, she was a leading cast member on soap operas in the 1950s and '60s, a rarity for black actresses of the era.","Actress, Civil Rights Agitator Ruby Dee Dead at 91","Actress, Civil Rights Agitator Ruby Dee Dead at ____",91,Copy( 91 ),0

I can tell you that over a period of four years, by virtue of the policies that we'd put in place, we'd get the unemployment rate down to 6%, and perhaps a little lower,  he tells Time in an interview picked up by CNN and the Washington Post. The Congressional Budget Office expects the unemployment level, currently at 8.1%, to remain above 8% through next year. But based on the current rate of growth, it is predicted to hit 7% by the end of 2015 and 5.5% by the end of 2017, meaning Romney may actually see his dream come true—regardless of whether he's elected.

The 5-foot by 3-foot piece is not part of the landing gear, as previously reported; it's actually a portion of the underside of the wing known as a  trailing edge flap actuation support structure,  reports Reuters. As the AP explains, the part is located closer to the body of the plane and helps secure wing flaps that move in and out and help to regulate plane speed. Investigators initially thought it was part of the landing gear because both pieces have similar-looking hydraulics. And while some raised the possibility over the weekend that the debris was placed there on purpose, a rep for the NYPD said there's no evidence that was the case.

"(Nov 22, 2020  11:00 AM) A half-century after she was fired when IBM's chief executive learned she was transgender, Lynn Conway was called to an online meeting. Company employees—including transgender staff members—watched last month as executives apologized to Conway for the way she was treated in 1968, the New York Times reports. The company now supports transitioning employees, the head of human resources told her, but recognizes that none of that makes what happened to Conway any better. Transgender employees watching had a feeling they were  part of something phenomenal,  said Ella Slade, the company's LGBT+ and global leader. A friend of Conway's said,  Nothing beats an unequivocal apology for vindication and closure.  Then Conway, 82, who was hired in 1964 and was a rising star of a computer engineer when she was called in by her boss after telling him she was transitioning, was presented with a lifetime achievement award for her groundbreaking work.  It was so unexpected,  Conway said, adding that she became teary.  It was stunning.  She was part of an architecture team working on a project to create a high-speed computer when her IBM career ended, per the Times.  It was a golden era in computer research, a time when fundamental breakthroughs were being made across a wide front,  Conway wrote. Her supervisors wanted her to go on leave, then come back to IBM after surgery with a new identity. But their bosses feared a scandal. So Conway moved on, developing computer chip design methods later adopted worldwide and becoming a professor at the University of Michigan. She expressed no bitterness at her treatment.  To go back and slam and blame and defame people, there is a problem with that because it tends to divide people and create an angst that’s unresolvable,  Conway said.  However, you do need evidence that there has been serious learning and appreciation and horror over what happened from today’s gestalt.

NBC News reports 53-year-old Leyla Cox of Staten Island died earlier this week at Punta Cana's Excellence resort. The family of 78-year-old American Jerry Curran also recently revealed that he died at the Dreams hotel there in January. This follows the death of two tourists at the island's Hard Rock resort (one in July 2018, one this past April), the death of a Pennsylvania woman in May at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville, and the deaths of a Maryland couple and a Philly woman at the Grand Bahia Principe la Romana—two in May, one in June. Meanwhile, a Denver couple that vacationed on the island in June 2018 tell Contact7 they also became sick at the Grand Bahia Principe. Back in the US, doctors told them they likely had pesticide poisoning; they now have a $1 million suit against the resort. At least three of the deaths have been tied to pulmonary edemas.

"(Feb 4, 2016  8:13 AM) A US National Academy of Medicine committee said Wednesday the FDA should approve clinical trials for three-parent fertilization in human embryos—with some caveats, Nature reports. In its report, the committee recommended such trials be limited to women at risk of passing along  serious mitochondrial disease  to their kids, and it wants the mitochondrial replacement techniques, or MRT, limited to male embryos only initially. That's because mitochondria is inherited from the mother, and such a restriction would confine the modified mitochondria to one generation.  We concluded that the most germane issues could be avoided if the use of these techniques were restricted by certain conditions, rather than prohibiting them altogether,  committee chair Jeffrey Kahn says in a press release. How the process would work: We have two types of DNA—nuclear DNA, which passes on genetic traits, and mitochondrial DNA. During MRT, a woman with mitochondrial DNA disease would have her nuclear DNA transferred to the nuclear DNA-free eggs of a woman whose mitochondrial DNA is just fine. This would result in three parents, with nuclear DNA from one man and one woman and mitochondrial DNA from another woman. But despite the committee's recommendation, there's still one major hitch: The federal 2016 spending bill currently in effect prohibits the FDA from greenlighting the implantation of modified embryos into women.

One, dubbed Anna by CBC News, awoke in her Calgary apartment in April to find a dark figure moving around. Per court testimony Tuesday, John Joseph Macindoe had broken in with a  rape bag  including pliers, a buck knife, lubricant, condoms, bondage straps, duct tape, Benadryl, and a ball gag. Anna feverishly texted her boyfriend on her Apple Watch to call 911, then pretended to be asleep while Macindoe hovered so close she could feel his breath, per the Calgary Herald. Luckily the police showed up in 15 minutes and pounded on the door. Macindoe has pleaded guilty to several charges including intent to commit sexual assault.

James Prudenciano, 28, and his date Paige Paruso were hiking on a mountain trail in Hartshorne Woods Park when she slipped on vines and couldn't get back over an incline. Trying to rescue her, Prudenciano also got stuck, so they followed their training and slid down the mountain—but went farther than expected and landed hard on a ledge. That's when Prudenciano's Apple Watch detected the fall and automatically called 911.  I was screaming that I'm going to die because I really felt I was going to die,  he tells News 12 New Jersey.

We don't think it's much to break a glass ceiling for one woman and leave millions of women behind,  said the chair of the Feminist Majority, one of the groups that is supporting Obama. A recent poll showed that the Illinois senator holds a 5-point lead over McCain among women—although he has fallen 13 points behind among white women.

The snow hadn't melted at La Plagne ski resort, their true destination: They hadn't made it there, because their bus driver followed the wrong GPS directions and took them on a 750-mile detour to a different part of the country, the Guardian reports.  There are three entries [in the GPS] for La Plagne in France, and I selected the wrong one,  the driver revealed to Studio Brussel radio station, per the BBC. The journey started in Leuven, about 18 miles outside of Brussels.

When I woke up at first light, all I saw were vineyards,  passenger Sven Ceuppens tells the BBC.  Nice, but very uncommon if you want to ski.  He adds that the group tried to tell the driver his GPS was steering them wrong, but he wouldn't believe them until they pulled out a map of France and showed him they were near the Spanish border.

As the Guardian reports, the attack on one is believed to have frightened the 209 others, who sailed over a 650-foot cliff in an apparent bid to flee. That cliff sits on the border with Spain, and most of the recovered bodies—169—were found in the Spanish village Lladorre; the rest ended up on the French side of the border. Bear fur was found on one of the bodies, and the Local reports that an analysis of it does point to a bear prompting the scare, which came almost exactly a year after more than 130 sheep died similarly. The French government, which has been reintroducing brown bears to the Pyrenees for the last 20 years or so after hunters completely depleted the native population, will compensate the farmer. A local branch of the French farmers' federation is furious nonetheless. Sheep breeders have previously protested the presence of bears and wolves, which they say threaten their flocks and livelihood. The current estimate suggests there are 35 brown bears inhabiting the Pyrenees. Last year, one was found with a gunshot wound to the chest in northern Spain, though it enjoys protected status there.

The Plain Dealer reports 40-year-old Anthony Lemons said a burden was lifted from him as a judge acquitted him yesterday. Lemons was imprisoned for a 1994 shooting that authorities said was a dispute over drug money. He steadfastly denied involvement and was released on parole in December 2012. In granting a new trial last year, the judge had noted police reports were withheld from the defense that contained important information that could raise doubts about a key witness. One indicated the witness identified Lemons citing shoes that weren't manufactured at the time. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Blaise Thomas says the office doesn't concede Lemons is innocent. But Thomas says prosecutors couldn't go forward with the new trial because the eyewitness died, and the judge wouldn't allow transcript of her testimony to be used in the new case. Lemons' next legal step could be pursuing a court declaration that he was wrongfully convicted, a necessary step in seeking compensation from the state, which he says he is seeking. He says he would use any such payment to start a program to help released inmates transition back to life outside prison.

Biden said he thinks that if more people wear masks as the first round of vaccinations takes place, the combination will  drive down the numbers considerably,  per the BBC. And he and Vice President Kamala Harris will set an example by masking up, he said. Biden has asked Americans to get past the politics of masks and other pandemic restrictions.  It's time to end the politicization of basic, responsible public health steps like mask wearing and social distancing,  he said last month.

Their reports suggest the program has a been a huge waste of money that has fallen way short of its primary mission—diagnosing brain injuries among the troops.  We have failed soldiers,  says a retired colonel who used to run the program.  I can see firsthand the soldiers that we've missed, the soldiers that have not been treated, not been identified, misdiagnosed. And then they struggle.  Congress in 2007 called on the military to test troops’ brain function before and after deployment to help fight the rising number of traumatic brain injuries. One big problem: The test ultimately chosen isn’t the best one available for the job, insiders say. What's more, the people who invented the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric and stood to gain financially from its use were involved in the military's decision to employ it. The Army thinks it's essentially useless at this point, even though soldiers continue to be tested with it.

The remains of middle-aged adults, young adults, and juveniles were found in various states, with some charred and deformed, perhaps indicating that a fire in the small house caused roof beams to fall on them. But how did bodies get there in the first place? Perhaps it was a  prehistoric disaster  like an epidemic, say Jilin University anthropologists who analyzed the bodies.  Ancient humans put remains into the house successively and stacked [them] centrally,  according to a summary of their work at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. Plus the victims' ages are close to those of bodies from an ancient mass burial in the Miaozigou region, prompting speculation that an epidemic wiped out populations and left survivors little time to conduct proper burials.  On the floor, numerous human skeletons are disorderly scattered,  reads another report on the Hamin Mangha discovery, in Chinese Archaeology.  The skeletons in the northwest are relatively complete, while those in the east often [have] only skulls, with limb bones scarcely remaining. But in the south, limb bones were discovered in a mess, forming two or three layers.

Muskegon firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach told the Muskegon Chronicle that he reluctantly agreed to enter the two-story, smoke-filled house to retrieve the snake.

Now, an effort is underway to locate the child, who hasn't been heard from since he fell into a 360-foot-deep borehole while walking with his family in southern Spain on Sunday. The only sign of him so far: The cup and candies the child, named Yulen or Yulan, was holding were spotted at a depth of 255 feet by a camera lowered into the hole; the camera has reportedly made it to a depth of 262 feet thus far. The hole measures just shy of 10 inches wide, meaning it's too small for an adult to fit into, and there's plenty of concern about the potential for collapse. Indeed, the Local reports it's possible that as the boy fell, the walls were disturbed, meaning dirt may be covering him.

As the CBC points out, we're talking about trace amounts: The February water samples from Vancouver Island measured 1.4 Becquerels of Cesium-134 and 5.8 Becquerels of Cesium-137 per cubic meter of water. For comparison, Canada allows 10,000 Becquerels of the latter in drinking water; tests off Japan's coast in 2011 found 50 million Becquerels.

It contains no material likely to offend or harm  and  should be suitable for audiences aged 4 years and over.  The cost of that classification: more than $6,000. But hey, it was money  well spent,  says Lyne, who created the 10-hour movie—which indeed shows nothing but paint drying on a brick wall—with the sole intention of sticking it to the man, per Sky News. Basically any film aiming for a UK release has to be reviewed by the BBFC, which charges $145 per review, plus an additional $10 and change for each minute the film runs, per the International Business Times. Because Lyne knew examiners would have to watch an entire flick to review it, he started a Kickstarter campaign with the goal of creating the longest and most boring movie possible.  About a year ago, I went to a filmmaker open day held by the BBFC,  Lyne writes in a Reddit AMA.  I'd expected to see quite a lot of conflict between the BBFC examiners and the visiting filmmakers whose work was at the mercy of the board, but … most of the filmmakers—even those who'd had trouble with the BBFC in the past—seemed totally resigned to the censorship imposed by the board, even supportive of it,  he says.  I think that shocked me into action.  In the end, Lyne raised about $8,500 and submitted a 607-minute film for review. Two examiners had to watch the film over two days.

At age 16, Ivins Rosier confessed to breaking into the home of Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody in West Palm Beach and shooting the 5-year-old German Shepherd, the newspaper noted in May. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective  hustled  the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the  murder of a law enforcement officer  (which wasn't legally true).

He explains:  We recast American presidential elections as stability, the party holding the White House keeps the White House. And earthquake, the White House party is turned out of power.  The way his 13 keys work is that each one is answered true or false.  True  indicates the White House party will retain power. Six or more false answers equal a political earthquake. Some of the keys are pretty basic political factors: Key No. 2, for instance:  There is no primary contest for the White House party.  True. Others are economic, like Key No. 6:  Long-term economic growth during this presidential term has been as good as the past two terms.  False. Others are societal, like No. 8:  There is no social unrest during the term.  False. Others are geopolitical, as with No. 10:  The White House has no major foreign or military failures abroad.  True  so far,  per Lichtman. And then there's the nature of the candidates. No. 13:  The challenger is uncharismatic.  True, says Lichtman of Biden. His tally? Seven falses, meaning Biden has it—at least, according to the Keys.",'Nostradamus of Presidential Elections' Names 2020 Winner,'Nostradamus of Presidential Elections' Names ____ Winner,2020,Copy( 2020 ),0

The bodies of Mark Short, 40, Megan Short, 33, and children Willow, 2, Mark Jr., 5, and Lianna, 8, were found in their home in Sinking Spring, Pa., on Saturday afternoon when a relative called police after Megan didn't show up for a lunch date.

Police say the couple had  domestic issues,  and a friend in the neighborhood tells the Reading Eagle that Megan was planning to leave Mark and had been open about it, posting on Facebook that she needed people to help her move out on Friday. In 2014, the Eagle reported on Willow's struggle to survive her first week of life. In 2015, the Shorts and their struggle to obtain anti-rejection medicine for Willow were featured in a New York Times story.

"(Feb 13, 2018  12:08 PM) Though there's no indication it'll be any more successful than the many complaints it follows, a federal lawsuit is challenging the Trump administration's policy of banning marijuana at the federal level—and is led by a 12-year-old girl. The case brought against the Justice Department by five plaintiffs—including Alexis Bortell, who uses medical marijuana to treat her epilepsy, and former NFL player Marvin Washington, who sells marijuana-based pain relievers—heads to a New York court on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. The case before Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein has what Fresh Toast calls  immense promise  for pot advocates, as plaintiffs argue that current law classifying marijuana as among the most dangerous narcotics violates constitutional rights. Filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan in July, the suit gained increased attention after Jeff Sessions last month opened up the option for prosecutors to enforce federal law in states where marijuana has been decriminalized. The lawsuit claims the Schedule 1 drug has been used by everyone from Thomas Jefferson, who apparently found it eased his migraines, to ancient Egyptians, who used it to treat eye sores and hemorrhoids, and is only banned based on efforts to target hippies and black Americans after the 1960s. The Cannabis Cultural Association, another plaintiff in the suit, argues  the Controlled Substances Act has been enforced against people of color exponentially more than Caucasians,  a lawyer tells the Cannabis Business Times.

But nobody at all snapped up a jalopy listed five years ago and described thusly:  SERIAL # X53L on documented 1953 pre-production Corvette Frame. We believe this to be a 1953 Pontiac prototype that was to assume the name Longoria? Info received todate indicates that ZAGATO designed and PINNAFARINA constructed the body for GM in late 52.  As Fox News reports via Hagerty, that listing turned out to be a storied 1960 Corvette known as the Cunningham Corvette No. 1—one of three turned into racecars by Briggs Cunningham, who put the cars through their paces at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1960. All three eventually were converted back to be street-legal, and were sold. No. 1 was the final one to resurface, now in  gaudy purple paint, poorly applied.  We'll likely never know where No. 1 spent its missing half-century. It may have been drag-raced, and its engine is missing. It's currently sitting in Indiana, the property of car collector Gino Burelli after a lengthy legal battle, and will head to New York state for a restoration that's estimated to take up to a year and cost upward of half a million dollars.

Over 20 other schools in Jefferson County, Colo., also restricted access Tuesday as officials investigated what they called a  credible threat,  the Denver Post reports. The FBI is leading the probe with help from the county sheriff and area police forces.  We too are taking this threat seriously,  Aurora police tweeted.  ...we are increasing police presence at our schools.  Law enforcement requested the lockout after a  suspicious person  was seen in the area, says a rep for JeffCo Public schools. The move comes four days before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, which left 12 students and one teacher dead on April 20, 1999. A lockout—which restricts school access and forces students to stay inside—is less dire than a lockdown, which is designed to protect students from a threat inside the school. But Colorado schools are also seeing more lockdowns as students report more possible threats in the age of mass shootings:  It's become as routine as fire drills,  a Denver Public Schools offical tells the Post.  We don’t have many students that have started their academic career with us who aren't used to lockdowns.

The weather forecast was  partly cloudy,  Popolizio tells the Daily Gazette. Then fog rolled in so thick they could barely see their hands in front of their faces, and they ended up lost for 48 hours in blizzard conditions near the top of Algonquin Peak, the state's second-highest mountain. At one point, they even lost their footing and began sliding down the mountain, Popolizio tells CBS News.  I was freezing. The fall pushed all of the snow up my jacket, into my gloves, in my boots. I was covered in snow.  She says she owes her survival to Alois, who helped her keep her feet and legs warm with his bag when she started going numb and kept her going by talking to her about what their lives would be like once they got rescued. After two days of searching, rescue crews finally located the couple on Tuesday, 265 feet below Algonquin's 5,115-foot summit, the Albany Times Union reports. Both were hallucinating by that point, but they knew the choppers they were hearing were real, and they started screaming, drawing rescuers to them.

That tallied up to 180,000 obesity-related deaths linked to an over-consumption of sweetened beverages in 2010; the figure includes 25,000 dead Americans. The cause of death wasn't too much Pepsi: Rather, the drinks pack on the excess pounds, which up the risk of death from other diseases. Of the 180,000, more than 70% succumbed to diabetes, with 44,000 dying of cardiovascular disease and 6,000 of cancer, say researchers. Of the countries studied, Mexico was No. 1 in terms of number of deaths, with the US in third. Researchers say the data  suggests that limiting sugary-beverage intake is an important step in reducing diabetes deaths.  But the American Beverage Association says the report is  more about sensationalism than science. The researchers make a huge leap when they take beverage intake calculations from around the globe and allege that those beverages are the cause of deaths which the authors themselves acknowledge are due to chronic disease.

McGinniss authored other books and worked as a newspaper columnist, but cemented his legacy with 1983's Fatal Vision, his controversial account of the murders of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald's pregnant wife and two children. McGinniss, who was initially invited to chronicle the trial by MacDonald himself, eventually came to believe MacDonald was guilty and inserted himself blatantly into his own narrative; MacDonald was convicted, but eventually sued McGinniss successfully. In 2011, he authored The Rogue, his very unauthorized biography of Sarah Palin.

That's not to say their suit has gone far: The case against the maker and retailers of the AR-15—a Bushmaster, in Newtown's case; an  aesthetically similar,  equally lethal, yet  internally ... different beast  Sig Sauer MCX rifle was used in Orlando, notes the Washington Post—is 18 months old, and if it goes to trial, it won't be for another two years. But few expected it to get as far as it has. Connecticut Judge Barbara N. Bellis refused to dismiss the case, established a trial date (which  startled  some plaintiffs), and ordered that the discovery phase begin, though the case may still not go to trial. Bellis must make that determination by October; each side will plead its position a final time on Monday. Even if a trial does occur, the Guardian paints the suit as having a  remote chance of success.  The suits' defendants—manufacturer Remington, a distributor, and a local gun shop—reference the 2005 federal shield law that has stopped most would-be suits by victims of gun violence, as it provides the makers and sellers with immunity when their guns are used in a crime. And so the plaintiffs are going after them via a  creative legal move,  per the Guardian: The shield doesn't cover negligent entrustment, in which someone who shouldn't have a gun is sold one. While Nancy Lanza legally purchased the gun used by her son in the Sandy Hook massacre, the families are arguing that it's negligent for any American to be able to buy a  high-velocity ... weapon of war,  as the Times puts it.",Newtown Families' AR-15 Suit Is Chugging Along—Surprisingly,Newtown Families' AR-____ Suit Is Chugging Along—Surprisingly,15,Copy( 15 ),0

Ai's wife, Lu Qing, was brought to a secret location to meet with him for about 20 minutes, under the condition they did not talk about sensitive issues, only family and health.  He seemed conflicted, contained, his face was tense. I could see redness in his eyes. It was obvious that without freedom to express himself he was not behaving naturally even with me,  says Lu, who adds that Ai otherwise appeared to be in good health.

We were careful, we knew that the deal could be broken at any moment, so we were careful.  Lu says Ai was not handcuffed and was wearing his own clothes instead of a detention center uniform. His trademark beard had not been shaven.

As people talked and smoked in the stadium in Lufeng in southern Guangdong province, the Guardian reports that 10 people were sentenced to death and then whisked away to be immediately executed. Seven had committed drug-related crimes; the rest had convictions related to murder and robbery.

That was 17.8 million cubic yards in 2012—an amount so unfathomable that for more than 20 years IKEA, which was incorporated in 1943, has managed it all through its own wood sourcing and production company, Swedwood, reports Gizmodo.

Four members of the Wagner family were arrested Tuesday, and authorities say a custody dispute played a role in the murders, the AP reports. Edward  Jake  Wagner, now 26, was the ex-boyfriend of Hanna Rhoden, 19, who was killed while lying in bed with her 4-day-old baby girl. Wagner was not the newborn's father, but shared custody of another daughter, Sophia, now 5, with Rhoden. Sophia was not with her mother when she was murdered; the newborn as well as two of her young cousins who were present were not hurt. (This chart shows how all the victims were related.) Also arrested, per Cincinnati.com: Wagner's parents George  Billy  Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and his brother George Wagner IV, 27. All four have been charged with eight counts of aggravated murder and also face a slew of other charges. The mothers of both elder Wagners were also arrested and accused of forging custody documents in an alleged cover-up of the crimes. Citing a  fixation  and  obsession  the Wagner family allegedly had with the custody situation, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Tuesday the situation is  the most bizarre story I've ever seen. It's just amazing.  Authorities say the Wagners knew the Rhodens well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. But the Wagners have long denied involvement and insisted they were close friends with the Rhodens; they moved to Alaska after the killings due, they said, to intense speculation over their possible involvement in the case.  Sophia is getting older,  Jake Wagner (who also set up a GoFundMe for custody-related legal bills in the wake of the massacre) said at the time, so they moved  so she wouldn’t hear it.

Paresh Nath and Goutam Ghosh have been missing since Saturday, said Wangchu Sherpa of the Trekking Camp Nepal agency. They were last seen near the Everest summit. Two of their companions who fell sick were being helped down the mountain. About 30 climbers have developed frostbite or become sick near the summit in recent days. Most of the sick climbers suffered frostbite while attempting to reach the summit or on their descent, Mountaineering Department official Gyanendra Shrestha said. Favorable weather has allowed nearly 400 climbers to reach the summit since May 11, but the altitude, weather, and harsh terrain can cause problems at any time. Several Sherpas carried one sick climber from the highest camp, at nearly 26,240 feet, to Camp 2, at 21,000 feet, where attempts were being made to pick her up with a helicopter, said Pemba Sherpa of the Seven Summit Treks agency. Seema Goshwami of India had frostbite to her hands and feet at the South Col camp and was unable to move.  It took a big and risky effort, but we were able to save her,  Pemba Sherpa said, adding that an Iranian climber identified only as S. Hadi had been brought to Kathmandu and was recovering in a hospital. A Norwegian woman, 45-year-old Siv Harstad, suffered snow blindness and was helped down from the summit Saturday. The two climbers who died were on the same expedition team. It was undecided when and if their bodies will be brought down, Pasang Phurba of Seven Summits said. Carrying bodies down Everest takes at least eight Sherpas, since they become frozen and heavier. The two deaths were the first confirmed this year on Everest.

The exact mechanism between coffee and mortality still needs clarification,  a co-author told the Guardian, though the habit may be associated with a poor diet or sleeping late. But  dietary factors, marital status and other socioeconomic factors that were not adjusted for in this study may account for some or all of these observations,  a doctor said.

"(Nov 20, 2014  4:21 PM) A researcher who figured out how people were contracting a new ailment called Lyme disease in the early 1980s has died at age 89, reports NBC Montana. Swiss-born Willy Burgdorfer made the discovery while not even looking for it. He was dissecting deer ticks sent from Long Island that were suspected in an outbreak of spotted fever when he noticed something unusual—corkscrew-shaped bacteria called spirochetes, explains the New York Times.  He immediately recognized these things under the microscope, and thought, 'Aha, this is probably what's causing Lyme disease in the Eastern United States,'  says Tom Schwan, a colleague who worked with Burgdorfer at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana. Further research proved Burgdorfer right. No cure yet exists for Lyme, but Burgdorfer's discovery paved the way for antibody tests and better prevention.

On it: the cryptographic  private key  he needs to access 7,500 Bitcoins. And since the digital currency hit a major milestone yesterday, with a single coin now worth more than $1,000 on the most popular exchange, that tossed hard drive is worth more than $7.5 million. Unfortunately, Howells doesn't have a firm sense of when he sent it to its resting place in the Docksway landfill near Newport, Wales, though he's been racking his brain since Friday, when he realized his error:  between June 20 and Aug. 10. Probably mid-July  is the best he can come up with. It was a dumb move then, too: The Guardian estimates the Bitcoins were worth just north of $800,000 at the time. Howells amassed his Bitcoins in February 2009, reports Ars Technica, after just a week of running a program on his laptop; but he knocked lemonade on the laptop a year later and broke it down for parts. He eventually tossed the hard drive without remembering what was on it. And his chances of getting it back don't look good. He tells the Guardian that even for the police to find it, they'd need  a team of 15 guys, two diggers, and all the personal protection equipment.

A prime and much publicized example was that of Michael L. Johnson, now 25, a Lindenwood University wrestling star at the time of his 2013 arrest who is serving 30.5 years for  recklessly  infecting a male partner with HIV and exposing four others to it. Or, was: On Tuesday, a new trial was ordered for Johnson by a Missouri appeals court, which overturned his conviction after finding the trial court did indeed  abuse its discretion  in airing portions of jailhouse phone calls Johnson made that the defense didn't get access to until the morning of the trial's first day. In Missouri's case, not disclosing your HIV status to a partner, as Johnson's accusers alleged and he denied, can be a felony. The ACLU of Missouri is backing Johnson, and as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, flagged what it (and others) perceive to be problems with the conviction and sentence: that the  law under which he is charged is based on outdated science.  Critics of such laws cite significant medical advances and note that while the person with HIV faces legal repercussions, the partner who chose to have unprotected sex does not, reported BuzzFeed last year. BuzzFeed separately reports on what was in those taped calls: Johnson saying his level of confidence that he had alerted his partners to his status was  pretty sure.  The court pointed out it was  the only evidence in the record of Johnson stating to anyone that he was not certain,  making it  highly prejudicial evidence  that Johnson's defense should have had time to prepare to for.

Yahoo News reports senators Rand Paul and John McCain are having a bit of a tiff this week after McCain called Paul out on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. McCain was seeking a vote on a Senate bill—expected to be widely supported—in favor of Montenegro's efforts to join NATO. According to Politico, 23 of 28 NATO member nations have already voted in favor of Montenegro joining—but Russia is strenuously opposed to it. McCain claimed anyone who didn't support the bill would be  carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin.  After Paul blocked a vote on the bill and left the Senate, McCain went further, accusing Paul directly of  working for Vladimir Putin.  Paul responded to McCain's comments Thursday, and he didn't pull any punches.  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged,  Paul said, adding that McCain  makes a really, really strong case for term limits.  And he accused McCain of possibly being  past his prime.  Paul justified his opposition to the Montenegro bill by saying that the US military has enough on its plate without possibly having to support the small country, the Hill reports. He also claimed NATO membership isn't supported by a majority of Montenegro citizens. Paul said being called a traitor for opposing the bill might be  a little over the top.

Police and witnesses say Charles Murphy, 56, jumped from a balcony at Sofitel New York Hotel in his business suit shortly before 5pm and died at the scene. Murphy's hedge fund at Fairfield Greenwich lost $50 million of the $7.5 billion it invested with Madoff, per DNA Info, and was subsequently sued by investors.

"(Oct 17, 2014  1:50 PM CDT) Scientists have discovered evidence of an ancient mountain range that spread 1,550 miles from Africa to South America back when the two continents were one. And strange as it may sound, the massive mountain range on the supercontinent Gondwana, similar in size to the Himalayas, actually fed our oceans millions of years ago.  Just like the Himalayas, this range was eroded intensely because it was so huge,  the study's co-author tells the Australian National University.  As the sediments washed into the oceans they provided the perfect nutrients for life to flourish.  The study authors add that their 600-million-year-old find marks the earliest evidence of a large-scale mountain range, comparable to the Himalayas, on the planet. Researchers guessed that such a mountain range existed  because of the way life thrived and ocean chemistry changed at this time, and finally we have found it,  a researcher says. Though the mountains are long gone, the  rocks from their roots told the story of the ancient mountain range's grandeur,  another adds. Such rocks have been found in both Mali and Brazil, Eureka Alert reports. Scientists analyzed the samples and discovered they were not only of similar age, but also formed at similar depths. They say the samples indicate the mountains formed when two continents collided, sending rocks 62 miles into the Earth's mantle.

Two of them didn't receive a letter. Sheila Murphy, whose Army son died in Syria in May, says she never heard from Trump, even after she wrote to him to say  some days I don't want to live.  Other families did receive calls: Aldene Lee says 10 days after her son was killed in Iraq in April, Trump called and described the soldier as a  lovely young man.  Asked Tuesday to clarify his comments on his predecessors not calling families, Trump said reporters could  ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama  when his son died in 2010.

"(Feb 3, 2014  4:03 PM) Archaeologists have excavated a 4,600-year-old pyramid in southern Egypt that was hidden under a pile of sand, waste, and its own remains, and come to a simple conclusion: They don't know what it's for. They do know the Edfu pyramid once stood 43 feet high and was brilliantly made in three blocks, LiveScience reports. It's also one of seven so-called  provincial  pyramids that may have been symbolic monuments affirming the king's power in those parts.  The similarities from one pyramid to the other are really amazing, and there is definitely a common plan,  says study leader Gregory Marouard. Supporting the royal-power theory, the researchers discovered an installation on the pyramid's east side that was apparently used for food offerings. But it seems the royals skipped off: By time Pharaoh Khufu came to power (2590-2563 BC), just 50 years after the pyramid was built, offerings weren't being made anymore and the pyramid had been abandoned. Khufu was focusing his resources on building the Great Pyramid at Giza, and may have felt his influence was assured in southern Egypt. The  center of gravity of Egypt was then at Memphis for many centuries—this region draining resources and manpower from the provinces,  writes Marouard.","4,600-Year-Old 'Mystery' Pyramid Excavated",____-Year-Old 'Mystery' Pyramid Excavated,"4,600","Copy( 4,600 )",0

The national average is 79%. If the former stat sounds too good to be true, Patagonia's HR head understands:  I wish it was 97.5% because 100% just doesn’t sound accurate.  But, as Quartz reveals, the company's success is real, and it's part of a corporate culture that was built to value people, not just profits. While Patagonia checks all the right boxes in terms of corporate child care and ample maternity and paternity leave, one fringe benefit is the deeper sense of community its approach fosters. One employee tells Quartz he doesn't just pop into the childcare center to read his 4-year-old a pre-nap book; his co-workers all know his daughter, and that deepens all their relationships. When the New Yorker recently profiled Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, it called him a  philosopher king,  exploring how his passion for living a balanced life that doesn't sacrifice the time spent outdoors for that corner office helped build the company into the quixotic beast it is today: the type of company that'll design and manufacture a jacket then market it with a full-page ad telling you not to buy it. But before all that, when Chouinard started his company, he did so by hiring his friends. When those friends started families, Patagonia worked to support those new parents, and the approach has evolved to comfortable extremes: If a Patagonia employee has to go on a business trip, the company will pay to fly a partner or nanny along; if neither is available, one of the child-care center's teachers will go.",How Patagonia Gets 100% of Its Moms to Return to Work,How Patagonia Gets ____% of Its Moms to Return to Work,100,Copy( 100 ),0

About $2 million in gold and $1.8 million in silver ends up in Switzerland's sewers each year, according to an environmental study commissioned by the Swiss government. Strange as it sounds, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology say it's not much of a surprise that 95 pounds of gold and 6,600 pounds of silver from Switzerland's gold refineries and watchmaking industry find a way into wastewater systems, along with trace amounts of rare earth minerals used in electronic components and even some paints, per CNN Money.

The diplomats were among 49 individuals charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan, though no arrests were made and only 11 of the diplomats and their spouses remained in the United States.

"(Jul 3, 2010  8:50 AM CDT) The government is handing out nearly $2 billion for new solar plants that President Obama says will create thousands of jobs and increase renewable energy sources. Obama announced the initiative in his weekly address today, saying the money is part of his plan to bring new industries to the US.  We're going to keep competing aggressively to make sure the jobs and industries of the future are taking root right here in America,  Obama said. The two companies that will receive the money from the president's $862 billion economic stimulus are Abengoa Solar, which will build one of the world's largest solar plants in Arizona, creating 1,600 construction jobs; and Abound Solar Manufacturing, which is building plants in Colorado and Indiana. Obama said that while it may take years to bring back all the jobs lost during the recession, the economy is moving in a positive direction. He placed some blame for the slow recovery on Republicans, saying they're  playing the same old Washington games and using their power to hold this relief hostage.",Obama Unveils $2B for Solar Projects,Obama Unveils $____B for Solar Projects,2,Copy( 2 ),0
"(Feb 21, 2013  9:22 AM) Scientists at Cornell have put 3D printing to an incredible medical use: They've made an ear remarkably similar to a natural one. Using 3D images of a human ear, they printed a mold to be injected with gel containing collagen from rats' tails, HealthDay reports. Next, they added cartilage from cows' ears.  It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later,  says a researcher. Cartilage grows around the collagen, ultimately replacing it after three months, the Cornell Chronicle reports. Scientists aim to use the technology to help children born with microtia, a condition in which the external ear fails to fully grow, though the inner ear has developed, LiveScience notes. It could also serve people who have lost their ears due to illness or accident, a researcher notes.  This is such a win-win for both medicine and basic science,  says a lead author behind the project.

And  before it gets better, it may get worse,  said the top UN envoy to the country, who says insurgents will likely stage high-profile attacks in coming months. The UN report found that 4,378 civilian deaths were linked to insurgents during that period, a 25% increase; 742 were killed or wounded by Afghan or international troops, an 18% decrease. Of the the latter group, at least 162 were killed in US airstrikes, the leading cause of civilian deaths at the hands of NATO forces. The report also noted that assassinations hit an all-time high in August, and that suicide attacks were staged an average of three times a week. The number of NATO troops killed also hit a gloomy record: 705 this year, up from last year's record of 521, reports the Washington Post.

Fox News reports it will be the most expensive high-school stadium in the country.  We're visionaries,  the Dallas Morning News quotes school district superintendent Rick McDaniel as saying. The stadium, which was included in a $220 million school bond measure, will seat 12,000 people and include an events center, the New York Times reports. It will be shared by three high schools.  Down south, football is a really big deal,  the chairwoman of a pro-stadium group explains. The vote on Saturday ended months of intense debate. Proponents of the stadium argued it would boost the local economy and turn McKinney into a  destination city.

Officers led both men away, and one woman also was handcuffed. A judge cleared the way for Spencer's speech after hearing arguments in a lawsuit filed by a Georgia man who rented the room where he spoke.

George Kirby, 103, and Doreen Luckie, 91, are the world’s oldest married couple, according to AFP. The newlyweds have been together (and living together) for 27 years, and have a slew of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren between them. In regards to why they waited so long to marry, Luckie said they just  didn’t want to bother.  That changed when Kirby popped the question on Valentine's Day—albeit in a nontraditional way.  I didn't get down on one knee, because I don't think I would have been able to get back up,  he explained. The pair married at a hotel in Eastbourne, on the southern English coast, and a Guinness Book of World Records guest was in attendance, reports the Independent. The happy couple were a combined 194 years and 281 days old on their wedding day—three years older than the previous  world’s oldest couple,  Francois Fernandez and Madeleine Francineau of France. The Brits met in 1988 through a group that organizes senior friendships, and hit it off right away. Kirby was a recently divorced 76-year-old, and Luckie had been widowed three years prior.

Bain died Monday of natural causes in his hometown of Livermore, Calif., at age 89. The show that made him famous debuted on NBC in 1978 and ran eight seasons. Diff'rent Strokes touched on serious themes but was known better as a family comedy that drew most of its laughs from its standout child actor, Gary Coleman. Bain, with his long training as a theater actor, proved an ideal straight man. Bain played wealthy Manhattan widower Philip Drummond, who promised his dying housekeeper he would raise her sons, played by Coleman and Todd Bridges. Today, the show is remembered mostly for its child stars' adult troubles. Coleman, who died in 2010, had financial and legal problems in addition to continuing ill health from the kidney disease that stunted his growth and required transplants.

The report looked at the National Institutes of Health's Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, in which more than 11,000 9- and 10-year-olds will be followed for a decade  to see how childhood experiences impact the brain,  per Bloomberg. The study began in 2013. 60 Minutes reported on the  first wave of information  from the study, which involved brain scans of 4,500 children, per AFP. Some key findings: children who spend more than seven hours per day on screens may experience premature thinning of the cortex, the outermost layer of the brain that processes sensory information, and kids who spend more than two hours per day on screens score lower on thinking and language tests. But the Telegraph notes that the second finding came from an observational study, meaning it wasn't possible to prove a link between the extra screen hours and the lower cognitive skill scores, and as for the premature cortical thinning (a natural process that typically happens in later development),  we don't know if it's being caused by the screen time,  a researcher explains.  We don't know yet if it's a bad thing.  Axios notes that these are preliminary results that have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and at the New York Times, science reporter and author Benedict Carey notes that the early results from the NIH study are actually a  mixed bag.

The jury exonerated the behavior of the crowd, saying it did not contribute to the tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, and that the victims were  unlawfully killed.  Relatives who had waged a tireless campaign to protect the reputation of their loved ones leapt to their feet outside a specially built courtroom, cheering and weeping, when the verdicts were announced. They chanted,  Justice for the 96!  and sang the Liverpool soccer club's anthem,  You'll Never Walk Alone.

After the tragedy, a false narrative that blamed drunken, ticketless, and rowdy Liverpool fans was created by police and spread by a local lawmaker. David Duckenfield, the police chief superintendent in charge of policing the game, testified at the inquests that he told a  terrible lie  by saying fans had rushed through gates into the stadium, rather than admitting to authorizing the gates to be opened.

Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said the hostages had been held in eight separate addresses in Mosul, their whereabouts monitored by drones and other means. Turkey had been reluctant to join a coalition to defeat the Islamic State group, citing the safety of its 49 kidnapped citizens. The United States had been careful not to push Turkey too hard as it tried to free the hostages.  After intense efforts that lasted days and weeks, in the early hours, our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country,  said Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.",ISIS Frees 49 Hostages From Turkey,ISIS Frees ____ Hostages From Turkey,49,Copy( 49 ),0
"(Mar 5, 2013  7:26 AM) Last week, Arkansas' governor vetoed a ban on abortions after the 20-week mark; the state legislature overrode the veto. Now, Gov. Mike Beebe has vetoed a bill that would ban abortions after just 12 weeks—and once again, lawmakers will today try to override the Democrat's veto; success would make it the toughest abortion ban in the US. All that's needed is a simple majority in both chambers of the legislature, where Republicans hold 21 of 35 Senate seats and 51 of 100 House seats, the AP notes.  Because it would impose a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic abortion well before viability, Senate Bill 134 blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court,  Beebe said of the 12-week measure. Roe v. Wade says abortion is legal until a baby can survive outside its mother, which doctors say typically occurs 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The American Civil Liberties Union says the 12-week ban is  the most extreme abortion ban in the country,  and it plans to sue if the measure passes.","After Veto, Arkansas Tries to Save 12-Week Abortion Ban","After Veto, Arkansas Tries to Save ____-Week Abortion Ban",12,Copy( 12 ),0

A person with active tuberculosis visited neonatal intensive care wards in two hospitals in Sacramento and Sutter County in March and April of this year, ABC reports. The person, who did not know he or she had the disease at the time, was not a health worker, but did have a valid reason to visit the intensive care units, say hospital authorities.  This is an unfortunate situation that happened, but it was not the fault of the person or the hospitals,  a health official says. The infection is difficult to detect in babies, so public health officials plan to test hospital administrators and staff members who may have been exposed to see if the infection spread.

"(Aug 17, 2015  7:47 AM CDT) A Canadian company best known for building tiny objects suitable for outer space has just earned a US patent on something distinctly grander: a 12-mile-high inflatable space elevator held up not by cables but by pressurized segments, reports fastcoexist.com. That's more than 20 times taller than the world’s current tallest building, the nearly 3,000-foot-tall Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. So why a space elevator? Because rockets (and, presumably, the space tourists inside them) require less force to launch when starting that much closer to the destination.  Landing at 12 miles above sea level will make space flight more like taking a passenger jet,  says Thoth Technology CEO Caroline Roberts in a press release. The inventor says astronauts would reach the top via electrical elevator, from where rockets can launch in a single stage to orbit as well as return to refuel. If this seems far-fetched, it's actually less ambitious than Obayashi Corporation's hope to build a space elevator a quarter of the way to the moon by 2050, reports CNET. Even so, Thoth's ambition still requires building just beyond what is known as the  Armstrong Limit,  or  the point at which atmospheric pressure is so low that your bodily fluids would boil off without a protective suit,  reports Global Construction Review.

"(Nov 14, 2017  1:09 PM) Getting to the 3-foot bust of Adolf Hitler, taken from his mountaintop retreat known as the Eagle's Nest, was a monthslong effort. Even on the day that Andrew Beaujon would set his eyes upon it, he had to pass through a security gate, drive a mile to its host building at Virginia's Fort Belvoir, then get inside a vault. There, he found the bust looking  less than menacing  with 70-year-old dents from boot kicks and the word  FOOL  written on the side. But opinions can change. That's part of the reason this item—one of 586 Nazi-era art pieces in Fort Belvoir's collection—is cloaked in near secrecy, Beaujon writes in a 3,500-word feature at the Washingtonian. As the curator of the collection explains,  There's a very narrow line that we have to walk because we certainly don't want it to be a rallying point for Nazism.  Neither did Gordon Gilkey, a  real-life Indiana Jones  who was instructed by the Chief Military Historian's office to seize all Nazi militaristic art in Germany after World War II, Beaujon writes. In his travels from an Austrian bar to a Bavarian castle, Gilkey uncovered 8,722 art pieces, most of which were returned to Germany after 1982 based on a historian's assessment that they were  laughable to all but the lunatic fringe.  The bust and four paintings by Hitler were among the  most heinous  pieces kept in US possession, and Beaujon notes recent neo-Nazi rallies mean the  conviction that these pieces were laughable feels a little less persuasive today,  even as the National Museum of the United States Army prepares to open at Fort Belvoir in 2019. The full piece is here, and explains how much of the collection was nearly handed over to a guy from Texas.","In Vault, US Army Keeps 3-Foot Bust of Hitler","In Vault, US Army Keeps ____-Foot Bust of Hitler",3,Copy( 3 ),0

So Price decided to put it to the test, and spend 5 days eating nothing but foods prepared in her Vitamix, which, she points out, behaves better than a juicer: It churns  everything into drinkable form, including fiber.  She made soups (which actually get hot if you let the Vitamix run for six minutes), smoothies, hummus, and almond butter. Emboldened, she deviated from the 301-page recipe guide, going so far as to toss in things like  droopy chard. ...

Sounds harmless—and it can be, depending on which group of people you're using it with—but the word literally is a reference to female sexual organs, according to the Royal Spanish Academy. However, according to that same academy, it can also express  diverse states of emotion, especially surprise or anger.  Depending on which ethnic group is using the word, it can range in offensiveness from  damn  to  f***,  the AP reports. Carlos Garcia is suing the city over the fine and suspension he received, and claims he never used the word (one student testified that he used it up to three times a week or more). But even if he had, Garcia is from the Dominican Republic, where the word is widely accepted as harmless slang, and can express anything from joy to sympathy.

The commemoration at the former death camp in southern Poland, an area under Nazi occupation during the war, is part of the UN-designated International Holocaust Remembrance Day, marked by politicians, survivors, and others in ceremonies and events across the world. At Auschwitz some of the survivors wore sashes or scarves that recalled the striped pajama-style clothing that prisoners were forced to wear, reports the AP. They placed candles and wreaths at a wall where many prisoners were executed before gathering with the presidents of Poland and Croatia for official ceremonies. The Nazis killed more than 1 million people at Auschwitz, most of them Jews, but also Roma, non-Jewish Poles, and others. There were other official commemorations across Europe on Wednesday—from Estonia and Lithuania to Serbia and Albania.

Insiders say the fallen giant of social networks, which News Corp purchased for $580 million in 2005, was sold for just $35 million, most of that in Specific Media stock. Since the buy, News Corp has lost a total of $1.4 billion on the business segment that houses MySpace, and analysts say walking away was the right move, AP notes. The site, whose own founders no longer use it, will be revitalized with a focus on music, its new owners say.

Apparently, more than 20,000 supporters agree with this statement by a Skarp Laser Razor rep, because they donated more than $4 million to a Kickstarter campaign for a shaving implement that promised to eliminate the pain, irritation, and mediocrity of regular shaving, Business Insider reports. Alas, the idea may be ahead of its time. After all those donations poured in, Kickstarter suspended the campaign because the makers don't have a working model that's up to snuff, reports the Register.

Nordstrom is banking on just the opposite, however, by stocking Golden Goose's Superstar Taped Sneaker. The shoe is described as  a distressed leather sneaker in a retro low profile,  available for $530 a pair, though just as distressed as the leather are those who say the shoes are a distasteful mockery of the poor, per USA Today. That's because the sneakers are detailed with  crumply, hold-it-all-together tape  and feature a  grungy rubber cupsole  (translation: They look scuffed and dirty). CNN notes negative reaction toward the sneakers made it into Twitter's  Moments  section. One commenter who reached out to Nordstrom online, calling the sneakers  awful  and  insensitive,  actually received a response, albeit a generic one.  We appreciate your feedback,  Nordstrom tweeted.  We realize taste is subjective and not every customer will like every product we carry.  The commenter responded by noting she'd grown up  ridiculously poor  and that  this isn't about taste. It's about not recognizing that a store ... doesn't get that poverty isn't fashionable. ...

Sundar Pichai's stock package, $90 million of which is based on Alphabet's performance, sets a company record, Reuters reports. Still,  it's behind Tim Cook’s grant of $376 million when he took over Apple,  an analyst said. The salary is a jump from the $1 paid last year to Larry Page for doing the job. The company said in a filing with the SEC said the pay package is in line with Pichai's  expanded role as CEO of Alphabet and Google.  He'd been making $650,000 as Google's CEO, per MSN.

"(Feb 16, 2018  11:55 AM) Wanted gang leader Thomaz Viera Gomez has been dubbed Brazil's very own Robin Hood, thanks to his alleged involvement in what may be one of the most unconventional kidnappings ever, reports Newsweek. That's because the two men Gomez, or  2N,  is accused of kidnapping on Jan. 27 are nurses who were ordered to vaccinate residents of one of Rio de Janeiro's slums. According to TV station Telesur, Gomez and his cronies stole syringes and yellow fever vaccines from a vaccination center before forcing the two nurses to leave with them. They then took them to the Salgueiro favela, or slum, where they were instructed to administer vaccinations over two hours. The nurses were then returned to their place of work. Brazil faced an outbreak of yellow fever, spread by infected mosquitoes, last year. And though government officials said it was over by September, more than half of 53 deaths from yellow fever since July occurred last month, per Tech Times. The nurses told local media the kidnappers weren't aggressive and had only the poor residents of Salgueiro in mind because they didn't have access to vaccination centers. Former environment minister Carlos Minc went as far as to describe his latest act as a  public service,  per Telesur. In another incident lending to his Robin Hood persona, Gomez is said to have caused a riot last March after throwing bunches of cash to locals in Salgueiro.",He Allegedly Kidnapped 2 Men.

Eddie Herrera admitted to choking 17-year-old Jackie Gomez during rough—but consensual—sex in a hotel room after the prom. According to the Houston Chronicle, Herrera says Gomez was alive afterward and they talked before both passing out. They had both been drinking heavily and had taken the prescription painkiller hydrocodone, the Dallas Morning News reports. Because of the substances in her system, it's still unclear whether Gomez died from an overdose or from strangulation. Gomez was found with bruises on her neck, and, the prosecutor said,  with a combination of the alcohol and the hydrocodone,  it's possible  the body was already so depressed that it could not recover from those choking injuries.  Herrera was charged with first-degree felony domestic violence and faced a potential life sentence. He called his mom after finding Gomez dead and the two waited two hours before calling 911. In that time, his mom allegedly dressed Gomez. Herrera was found guilty of aggravated assault, but his attorney plans to appeal the 25-year sentence. Gomez's cousin told the court the sentence wasn't long enough. Herrera's mother, Melissa Martinez, is facing charges of her own.

The next three to four days are most critical, says a Fox News doctor. Doctors first open the skull, look for bleeding, and cauterize blood vessels.  Patients are kept under anesthesia for three to four days to monitor brain swelling, which is one of the complications of this surgery,  explains the expert. If the bullet grazes the tip of one of the brain lobes, the victim has the greatest chance for survival, and a bullet through one hemisphere still offers a reasonable chance.

That was because the gift from great-aunt Alison came with a special instruction:  On the plain white box was a card that read, 'Do not open until your 1st disagreement,'  Kathy Gunn wrote in a post on the Love What Matters Facebook page, spotted by UPI.  Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments, and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,  writes Gunn.  There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box.  Doing that, she says,  would have symbolized our failure.

The pileup in Etna, near Bangor, happened around 7:30am and involved several cars, a school bus, and a tractor-trailer, state police spokesman Steve McCausland says. No fatalities were immediately reported, but McCausland says some of the injuries were serious. Emergency personnel climbed on top of cars to reach motorists stuck in the middle of the chaotic tangle of vehicles. McCausland says one veteran trooper described the site as a  giant pile of metal.  Both northbound lanes on a 30-mile stretch of highway were closed, and drivers were told to take exits in Etna and Newport to avoid the area. Troopers hoped to get the road reopened by the afternoon. Eastern Maine Medical Center had received 11 patients at its emergency department by 10am, all of them in good to serious condition. Police say the main crash involved more than 25 vehicles, and there are a series of other wrecks leading up to the crash site. Some of the crashes involved two or three vehicles, and then other vehicles went off the road to avoid colliding with them.

George Thomas Thornton gained national attention over the exploding whale, and the act endured for decades thanks to a video that shows giant pieces of whale carcass splattering across the beach and spectators. Thornton got the call Nov. 12, 1970, to remove a 45-foot-long sperm whale estimated to weigh 8 tons that had washed up near Florence and had started to stink; at the time, the state Highway Division had jurisdiction over beaches. Thornton felt they couldn't haul the whale out to sea because it would wash back up. They couldn't bury it on the beach, because the waves would uncover it. And they couldn't burn it. So Thornton consulted the Navy and other munitions experts, and was advised to blow it up. His crew set the dynamite on the landward side of the whale, hoping to blow it into the water and into little pieces that could be consumed by gulls and crabs. About 75 spectators and news reporters drew back to a sand dune a quarter mile away. When the blast erupted, it was greeted with cries of wonder that were soon replaced by sounds of revulsion as bits of whale covered people in goo; one big chunk even flattened the roof of a car.

The agency said today that online criminals tapped into the information of 104,000 people though the IRS' popular  Get Transcript  service. As the AP explains, the service allows people to access their previous returns, and therefore it would allow cyber-thieves who gain entry to grab all kinds of personal information. CNN Money reports that the thieves used the data to claim at least 15,000 fraudulent refunds, but it adds that the greater danger is the prospect of identity theft—and the possibility of bogus bank accounts and credit lines, for example. The IRS has shut down the service for the time being as it ramps up security. (The site Krebs on Security had warned of vulnerabilities at IRS.gov in March.) Still, Forbes explains that this wasn't a hack in the traditional sense. In order to get to the taxpayer information, the thieves were able to answer a slew of security questions— out of wallet  information they likely gleaned elsewhere from sites such as Faceook.

By eliminating these corrupt (militia members), oppression has been weakened and decreased in the area,  the message said, citing police  atrocities and crimes.  Taliban members have managed to enter the police force thanks to local officials' meddling in the recruitment process, a Ghazni activist tells the New York Times. The killings follow other insider drug attacks in December and January, the Times notes—but this seems to be the deadliest.","Insiders Drug, Kill 17 Afghan Cops","Insiders Drug, Kill ____ Afghan Cops",17,Copy( 17 ),0
"(Jul 13, 2010  9:03 AM CDT) Go ahead and start with the  Have mercy!  jokes now: John Stamos, aka Full House’s Uncle Jesse, is accused of having a fling with a 17-year-old high school student. Stamos met Allison Coss, now 24, during a 2004 spring break trip in Florida shortly after his split from wife Rebecca Romijn. Stamos supposedly invited Coss to his hotel room, kissed her, and offered her oral sex knowing she was 17. It reportedly gets weirder: She said no to his offer, he got angry and broke a bedpost, then apologized and invited her to stay the night, which she did. They went on to continue a  flirty kind of relationship  over email, her lawyer said. The supposed fling is coming to light because Coss claims to have pictures of Stamos surrounded by strippers and cocaine from that night in the hotel; she and 31-year-old Scott Sippola are now on trial for allegedly attempting to extort Stamos to the tune of $680,000. A judge ruled testimony about Coss’ relationship with Stamos would not be allowed, but her lawyer brought it up in her opening statement, the AP reports.

So what is it about these mushrooms, the white truffle in particular, that make people willing to spend $2,000 a pound on them? They’re rare—only available a couple months of the year from a limited area in Italy, and they have to be foraged by pigs—but does that make up for their smell? One chef describes it as  disconcerting. It conjures up images of a locker room.  But, she continues,  the aroma deceptively conceals their complex yet delicate taste. They are sublime.  But there are fewer each year, and currently not enough to meet demand.  The market just has to live with that, because truffles can't be faked or formulated,  says one importer.

During the tense moment, Clinton responded,  You know what? Nobody's ever asked me before,  adding that  I'm happy to address it.  Williams was escorted out before that happened, however. Now Clinton is taking the opportunity to respond—and she has more than a few regrets for ever uttering those  superpredator  remarks.  Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,  she told Jonathan Capehart, writing for the Washington Post. In the 1996 speech at New Hampshire's Keene State College, where she spoke about the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, Clinton said,  They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'superpredators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.  Capehart writes that the comments referenced  a narrow band of young people,  and he thinks that critics now accusing Clinton of suggesting that most or all black youth fell into that category are being unfair. He also notes that Bernie Sanders voted to pass that crime bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton. Adds candidate Clinton:  I was talking about the impact violent crime and vicious drug cartels were having on communities across the country and the particular danger they posed to children and families.",Hillary Regrets 'Superpredator' Remark Made in 1996,Hillary Regrets 'Superpredator' Remark Made in ____,1996,Copy( 1996 ),0

Scientists from Cancer Research UK say that lung cancer can remain dormant for more than two decades, then suddenly morph into an aggressive form of the cancer that's difficult to treat. The study published in Science reveals that initial genetic  faults  take place—and many of them are from smoking—but then those anomalies remain unknown for years, until new faults form later on and combine with the foundational faults to trigger a fast-moving growth of the disease. Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer in the US of both men and women, and the survival rate is low compared to other cancers, according to the most recent numbers available from the American Lung Association: While the five-year survival rate for lung cancer that's detected early is 53.5%, that rate plummets to 3.9% if the tumor has spread to other organs. As the scientists in this study explain, lung cancer is notoriously difficult to treat because when the various genetic faults start cropping up down the line, they're genetically different and appear in various parts of the tumor; targeted treatments in one part of the tumor, therefore, aren't effective at wiping out cancer in other parts, notes Cancer Research UK. This study was admittedly small—researchers examined just seven patients who were smokers, ex-smokers, or non-smokers—but these sobering statistics and treatment challenges are lighting a fire under scientists to conduct more research like this that may eventually enable earlier intervention.  If we can nip the disease in the bud and treat it before it has started traveling down different evolutionary routes, we could make a real difference in helping more people survive the disease,  Cancer Research UK's chief scientist says.

Prince Harry is expected to join them early next week. When they went back to Britain after spending the holidays in Canada, the royal couple shocked Harry's homeland by announcing that they plan to  step back  as senior members of the royal family and divide their time between Britain and North America, while becoming  financially independent.

In all, about 170 restaurants have  gone rogue,  in the words of the Wall Street Journal. Back in August, McDonald's canceled its franchise agreement with Connaught Plaza Restaurants, which operates 40% of McDonald's outlets in India. But rather than close up shop, the restaurants are operating as usual. McDonald's has been pressuring suppliers to cut off deliveries with mixed success, and Connaught Plaza's managing director, who brought the chain to India in 1996, hopes to keep the food flowing for as long as possible.  I cannot allow a large organization, this [multinational] monster, whatever you want to call it, to truly belittle our contributions,  says Vikram Bakshi. McDonald's, meanwhile, accuses Connaught Plaza of various contractual issues, including a failure to pay royalties. Bakshi's legal battles with McDonald's actually stretch as far back as 2008, and this latest round is expected to drag out in the courts as well. India has a growing middle class, and that theoretically makes the country a great market for McDonald's, notes the Economist. But it adds that this recent trouble  illustrates multinationals’ worst fears about India, from the instability built into the joint-venture model to the ease of stymieing legal judgments.

Claire Hough, 14, was found strangled with sand pushed into her mouth at Torrey Pines State Beach on Aug. 24, 1984, the Los Angeles Times reports. One of her breasts had been cut off. Brown, who processed evidence for the force from 1982 to 2002 but was not  assigned to any part of the murder investigation,  knew he was a person of interest, FOX 5 reports. The 62-year-old was found dead in a state park on Tuesday, and his death has been ruled a suicide. Tatro was 67 when he died in a 2011 boating accident in Tennessee. Officers had been building a case against Brown over the last two years and were planning an arrest, NBC San Diego reports.  I can only surmise that was part of the reason  he killed himself, a police rep says.

The embattled LA Clippers owner has hired a prominent antitrust lawyer and informed the NBA that he has no intention of paying a $2.5 million fine imposed for making racist remarks, sources tell Sports Illustrated and USA Today.  We reject your demand for payment,  the lawyer's letter informs the league per the sources; it claims  no punishment is warranted  because Sterling has done nothing wrong and says his  due process rights  have been violated. (SI notes that latter claim is somewhat backed up by the NBA's quickie 4-day investigation, but that as a private association it has no obligation to provide due-process rights.) The deadline for paying the fine actually came and went earlier this week. The letter doesn't mention the potential forced sale of the Clippers, sources say, but such letters are generally considered a precursor to a lawsuit and Sterling is known for his litigious tactics, reports the New York Times. Any lawsuit, however, will be an uphill struggle for Sterling, since he is contractually bound to follow the NBA's system of justice and his claim he has done nothing wrong is at odds with his admission of a  terrible, terrible mistake  in a CNN interview.

Library of Congress archives, an eagle eye, and a husband who happens to be a Whitman expert all combined to help a University of Nebraska-Lincoln professor unearth a long-lost poem from the Leaves of Grass bard, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Wendy Katz spotted the 15-line  To Bryant, the Poet of Nature  in the June 23, 1842, edition of the New Era, with the initials  W.W.  at the bottom (a common practice back then instead of full bylines, the Star notes). And while those initials could have belonged to practically anyone, Katz's careful research convinced the peer-reviewed Walt Whitman Quarterly Review it was a genuine Whitman creation. First Katz showed the poem to husband Kenneth Price, co-director of the Walt Whitman Archive. Price said it was possible the poem was Whitman's, based on the time period and the initials, but Katz kept investigating: She connected the dots between Whitman, his friend and fellow poet William Cullen Bryant (whom the poem is about), and New Era editor Parke Godwin, who was Bryant's son-in-law.  It [seemed] clear to me that they all knew each other and were writing for each other's papers,  Katz tells the Star. The newly found poem also meshes with Whitman's known works, in both theme and in what the Star calls the  more conventional and predictable  (Price adds  boring ) style of his early newspaper verse, rather than the more experimental style he became known for later.

Per Fortune, IBM will donate its Watson supercomputer technology—the same technology that beat humans on Jeopardy!, CNET notes—to Veterans Affairs hospitals and doctors' offices, offering precision genomic treatment to the largest cancer demographic (3.5% of all US cancer patients) in any one health-care group. At the National Cancer Moonshot Summit on Wednesday, the VA Department and IBM Watson Health said they hope to use this tech to scale up doctors' access to such treatment programs and help 10,000 or so veterans over the next two years, per a press release—about 30 times more than the current number in VA facilities using these treatments.  By applying Watson … we see an opportunity to scale access to precision medicine for America's veterans, a group most deserving of the best care in the world,  the VA's undersecretary for health says. How this  Watson for Genomics  will work: After DNA sequencing on cancer patients, that info will be plugged into Watson, which will analyze and cross-reference existing medical data and then spit out what's probably causing the cancer mutations and what precision treatment is likely the best option—a task that was previously extremely time-consuming due to the volume of data and not very scalable. Plus, physicians in any part of the country—not just those near urban centers with top cancer facilities—will have access. Forbes notes the project won't do much to help patients outside the VA system and that no one knows yet exactly how effective Watson will be at pulling off this ambitious job.

"(May 28, 2013  7:25 AM CDT) For centuries, the Catholic Church has had two sets of books—one for routine matters, the other containing records of controversial matters ranging from clandestine weddings performed by priests to clergy alcohol abuse. That second set of records, the first mention of which appeared in the 1700s, has been kept secret from nearly everyone, with only bishops and their inner circle having access to the materials. (In 1954, a scholar called for safes to house the files that could handle  attacks by drills, sledge hammers, wedges, and mechanical tools. ) But the US probe into sex abuse is finally opening up the files, and many are due for release within months. A hearing today may set a release date, the Los Angeles Times reports. The very existence of the records—given a range of names including sub secreto files, confidential files, and C-files—largely remained a secret until the 1980s; that's when a priest mentioned them to a Minneapolis lawyer investigating molestation reports. The LAT runs down a smattering of cases in which the church has been forced to turn over the files, including a nun's 1980 cold-case murder that saw prosecutors subpoena records on an Ohio priest in 2004. At first, the church offered just three pages of material, but a search warrant for his C-file led to 148 more. So why does the church hang on to the documents? the LAT wonders.  The church expects to be here forever,  says a former general counsel for Pittsburgh's diocese.

The Hillsborough County Fire Rescue responded to a 911 call from the Calypso Pool about a chemical release around 7pm Monday, reports ABC News. They transported the children, who were complaining of stomach discomfort and nausea, to the hospital, where they were treated for respiratory burns, stomach irritation, and vomiting. The owner of the pool said a thunderstorm earlier in the day caused the pump that circulates water in the pool to shut off, reports Fox News. The pump that infuses the water with chemicals kept running, however, filling one of the pipes. When the circulating pump turned back on, it pushed 2.5 gallons of mixed chlorine and muriatic acid into the pool, causing the gas cloud.

"(Jan 8, 2012  6:13 AM) Nuclear reactors in Japan will be retired after 40 years of use, as part of the government's efforts to step up nuclear safety in the aftermath of the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant disaster last March, reports the AP. There are 54 reactors in Japan, 18 of which will be 40 years old by 2020, and 18 more that will hit that mark by 2030. Japan will introduce legislation to close them, though there could be exemptions for plants that pass safety inspections. Although it is unclear whether age was a factor in the Fukushima disaster, some critics have pointed to the 1967 reactors' age-related factors, such as cracks in pipes and walls, as contributing causes. Before the disaster, nuclear power accounted for about 30% of Japan's electricity, but today just six reactors are in operation.

Per a statement posted to Facebook by St. Louis County Police, the officer, doing a  routine business check,  approached two males who were standing outside a Mobil gas station at 11:15pm; the officer says one pointed a gun at him.  Fearing for his life, the Berkeley Officer fired several shots, striking the subject, fatally wounding him. The second subject fled the scene.

"(Oct 8, 2020  12:09 AM CDT) For the sixth time in the Atlantic hurricane season, people in Louisiana are once more fleeing the state's barrier islands and sailing boats to safe harbor while emergency officials ramp up command centers and consider ordering evacuations. The storm being watched Wednesday was Hurricane Delta, the 25th named storm of the Atlantic's unprecedented hurricane season. Forecasts placed most of Louisiana within Delta's path, with the National Hurricane Center estimating landfall in the state on Friday, the AP reports. The center's forecasters warned of winds that could gust well above 100mph and up to 11 feet of ocean water potentially rushing onshore when the storm's center hits land.  This season has been relentless,  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, dusting off his now common refrain of 2020:  Prepare for the worst. Pray for the best.  A hurricane warning has been issued for a stretch of the northern US Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta is expected to become a major hurricane again, like it was days earlier before crossing part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. But some weakening is forecast once Delta approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Friday. So far, Louisiana has seen both major strikes and near misses. The southwest area of the state around Lake Charles, which forecasts show is on Delta's current trajectory, is still recovering from an Aug. 27 landfall by Category 4 Hurricane Laura. New Orleans spent a few days last month bracing for Hurricane Sally before it skirted to the east, making landfall in Alabama on Sept. 16.

"(Dec 4, 2016  12:59 PM) It is well established that humans across languages and cultures have a tendency to use more positive words than negative ones. This is called linguistic positivity bias (LPB), but why the phenomenon exists remains unclear. Now researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that their big data analysis of 200 years of words in Google Books (1.3 million texts from 1800 to 2000) and New York Times archives (14.9 million articles since 1851) suggests that the ratio of positive to negative written words  correlates strongly  with the Misery Index (which measure economic health) and war casualties. They also found that LPB has been on the decline, with researcher Morteza Dehghani calling it,  very generally, an indicator that happiness may be on the decline in the US.  But outside scientists urge caution when interpreting the results. The New York Times says the study does offer up evidence that objective circumstances (like war deaths and the economy, as noted above) and subjective happiness can alter our language, there are confounding factors at play in terms of citing a centuries-long decline. UPenn linguistics prof Mark Liberman, for instance, takes issue with the database of 907 words run against the texts, and give the example of  awesome,  which has evolved from meaning  daunting  to  excellent.  The researchers acknowledge that  our results ... encourage the development of more precise tools for inferring psychological states from historical texts.

"(Mar 7, 2020  11:00 AM) McCoy Tyner is no more. The nimble and innovative jazz musician—called by one critic  the most influential pianist of his generation —died Friday at home in Bergenfield, NJ. He was 81. Tyner will always be associated with John Coltrane's  classic quartet,  which erupted in the 1960s with pieces like  My Favorite Things  and  A Love Supreme.  As the Washington Post explains, Tyner's  shifting chords  and  fleet-fingered solos  pushed Coltrane's saxophone to greater heights.  Even though John was, so to speak, the engineer of the train, each of us had to fashion his own concept,  Tyner once said.  The stimulation was mutual; while we always felt the strength of John’s presence, he told us that what he played was a reaction to what was happening around him.  Disturbed by Coltrane's increasing atonality, Tyner broke free in 1965 and carved out a solo career that included the landmark album The Real McCoy (1967). He went on to win five Grammys for records including Blues for Coltrane (1987), The Turning Point (1991) and Journey (1993), per the New York Times. He also stuck stubbornly with acoustic piano as jazz experimented with funky styles and electronic music. Born the son of a beautician and a factory worker in Philadelphia in 1938, he converted to Islam as a teenager, married once, and had three sons.

Per the AP, Pence released a statement Sunday disavowing a New York Times story that reports he’s among Republicans gearing up for a shot at the White House in 2020 should Trump decide not to run for reelection. Pence’s statement said the article  is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team.  It called the allegations  categorically false,   laughable and absurd,  and described them as an attempt by the media to divide the Trump administration. The Times piece looks at members of the GOP who are possibly laying the groundwork for  shadow campaigns,  citing political maneuvers and fundraising by senators Cotton and Sasse as well as Ohio Gov.

But the article considers Pence at length, calling him the  pacesetter,  with mentions of his fundraising committee recently racking up $1 million at a Washington fundraiser, and his robust political event schedule. It says unnamed advisers to the vice president have indicated to donors that Pence is interested in a presidential bid, but only if Trump doesn't seek another term.

As the Canadian school's press release puts it,  Study says we're over the hill at 24.  The statement spins from a new study on cognitive motor performance, which had the researchers use statistical modeling to analyze the game-play success of 3,305 StarCraft 2 players, ages 16 to 44. They reviewed thousands of hours of cognitive-based moves across all skill levels, essentially tracking the players' responses to their rivals and the amount of time it took them to make those responses. And it's not casual game play: StarCraft 2 is a  ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money  and a game that's of interest to psychologists for the same reasons chess and bridge are, notes their paper, in PLOS ONE. What the psychology and statistics doctoral students and an adviser found: Even at high levels of skill, after about age 24,  players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance.  But don't panic, reports the Washington Post. Older players may be slower, but they're smarter: The data showed they were more prone to use short cuts or intricate commands to give them an advantage.

Magdy Hegazy, a top health official in Alexandria, said that along with the 43 killed, the crash also injured 122 people, the AP reports. The Egyptian Railways Authority said earlier that a train coming from Cairo, Egypt's capital, crashed into the back of a train that was waiting at a small station in the district of Khorshid, just east of Alexandria. The stationary train had just arrived from Port Said, a Mediterranean city on the northern tip of the Suez Canal, when it was hit, according to the statement. The statement did not say what caused the accident, only that the authority's experts would investigate. AP footage from the scene showed mangled train coaches on the tracks and several others derailed as hundreds of onlookers and victims' relatives gathered around on both sides of the tracks. Ambulances were standing by and riot police and soldiers were deployed to keep the onlookers away from the scene of the disaster. Residents from nearby homes rushed to the scene to look for survivors inside crushed train carriages or offer first aid to the injured. By nightfall, cranes aided by floodlights began to remove the wreckage off the tracks to allow rail traffic to resume. Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.

Bangura says she's verified the pamphlet, which first surfaced online in November, since getting hold of a copy in Iraq in April, noting it reflects actual transactions.

Sometimes these fighters sell the girls back to their families for thousands of dollars of ransom.  Bangura says the group's leaders get the first pick of captives before outsiders bid into the thousands on those that remain. Afterward, children aged 1 to 9 are typically sold to Islamic State fighters for about $165, according to the pamphlet. The prices then fall as the captives' ages rise. Adolescent girls fetch $124, while women over 20 are sold for less. The organized price list is just another way ISIS differs from other militant groups, Bangura says.

"(Apr 18, 2016  11:28 AM CDT) The US will deploy more than 200 additional troops to Iraq—upping the number from 3,870 to 4,087—and send Apache helicopters for the first time into the fight against ISIS in Iraq, the first major increase in US forces in nearly a year. The uptick in US forces—and the decision to put them closer to the front lines—is designed to help Iraqi forces retake the key northern city of Mosul, and help retake Raqqa, the extremist's group self-proclaimed capital in Syria, the AP reports. Last June the Obama administration announced hundreds of troops would be deployed to help the Iraqis retake Ramadi—a goal accomplished at the end of the year. Of the extra troops, most will be Army special forces, who've been used throughout the anti-ISIS campaign to advise and assist the Iraqis. The remainder will include some trainers, security forces for advisers, and maintenance teams for the Apaches. The advise-and-assist teams—made up of some dozen troops, each accompanied by security forces—will embed with Iraqi brigades and battalion, likely putting them closer to the front lines. The proximity to the battlefront will allow the US teams to provide more tactical combat advice as Iraqis move toward Mosul, still under ISIS control. Until now, US advisers have worked with the Iraqis at the headquarters level, well back from the front lines. A senior defense official told reporters that while Iraqi leaders have been reluctant to have a large number of US troops in Iraq, they also need certain capabilities that only more American or coalition forces can provide. Iraqi leaders back the addition of more US troops if their work is coordinated with Iraqis and directed toward retaking Mosul. Anonymous US officials have said that the number of special operations forces in Syria would be increased at some point, but Defense Secretary Ash Carter, speaking to US troops in Baghdad, didn't mention that.","US Sending Choppers, 200 Troops to ISIS Fight","US Sending Choppers, ____ Troops to ISIS Fight",200,Copy( 200 ),0

The crash occurred late yesterday as the passenger train, traveling at a speed of up to about 20mph, struck the stationary Amtrak train at the station in Oakland. The city Fire Department battalion chief says the company told him that train went through a red light. There were injuries on both trains, most of which were minor, but several people were taken to local hospitals. An Amtrak spokesperson, who would not comment on whether one train ran a red light, said the wheels of each lead engine went off the track.

That's 5.8 million women, USA Today reports. And the New York Times reports that usage has taken quite the jump, from just 4% in 2002; the latest numbers are from 2006 to 2010 data. Of those who have used Plan B or similar emergency contraception, half were worried their regular birth control failed, and the other half had not used birth control. The numbers are even higher for women in their early 20s: Nearly one-quarter of those who've had sex at least once have used emergency contraception. When it comes to regular contraception, 99% of sexually active women between 15 and 44 have used it, and that number is not much different for sexually active Catholic women: 98.6% have used it at least once.

That's what  industry sources  told the Mirror, though Plant's rep quickly shot down the story. The Mirror's sources said Zep superfan Sir Richard Branson offered the band that much money to do 35 concert dates in three locations (London, Berlin, and New Jersey), but Plant refused despite Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and the son of late drummer John Bonham being on board.  It was a no-brainer for [the rest of the band], but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,  one source says.

Census figures for 2009, the recession-ravaged first year of the Democrat's presidency, are to be released in the coming week, and demographers expect grim findings. The anticipated poverty rate increase, from 13.2% to about 15%, would be another blow to Democrats struggling to persuade voters to keep them in power. Should those estimates hold true, some 45 million people in this country, or more than 1 in 7, were poor last year. It would be the highest single-year increase since the government began calculating poverty figures in 1959.

The 73-year-old folk-country artist was admired by such big-name colleagues as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and, as Rolling Stone reports, he helped shape the Americana genre, whose current stars Jason Isbell and Brandi Carlile, among others, were also fans of his. Born in a Chicago suburb to the president of the local steelworkers' union and raised on the stars of the Grand Ole Opry, Prine started writing songs at a young age. After high school, he became a postal worker, an era during which he wrote many of his  classics,  per Rolling Stone. He was drafted into the army during the Vietnam War, though he ended up in Germany instead. Upon his return home, Roger Ebert discovered him performing at a Chicago club's open mic night. After Ebert's glowing review of that 1970 performance (which you can read in full here), Prine started selling out shows, including one attended by Kris Kristofferson and Paul Anka. They, too, were impressed, which ultimately led to Prine's deal with Atlantic Records. His self-titled debut album was released in 1971. Rolling Stone says he spent much of his career  underground,  with his songs covered and sung by such luminaries as Bonnie Raitt, Johnny Cash, George Strait, the Everly Brothers, Joan Baez, Carly Simon, and Bette Midler—but his 2018 album, his first one in 13 years featuring original material, was the highest debut of his career and led to some of the biggest shows he'd ever done (and that was after he beat cancer twice). Of his music, the New York Times says he  chronicled the human condition in song,  telling stories including those of of a drug-addicted war veteran, a lonely elderly couple, and a middle-aged woman stuck in a bad marriage.

They had been supplied by journalist David Cay Johnston, who said he received them in the mail from an anonymous source. The form shows that Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes on more than $150 million in income in 2005, though more than 80% of that was under the  alternative minimum tax  introduced to stop the rich using loopholes to avoid tax, which Trump wants to scrap.

Trump is the first president since 1976 not to have released his tax returns, which he says is because of an IRS audit.

This petition was created at a time … when it was looking unlikely that 'leave' were going to win,  he wrote in a Facebook post. And now that Team Leave is the victor, Healey is steaming.  I am genuinely appalled by the behavior of some of the remain campaign. … The referendum was fairly funded; democratically endorsed, every vote was weighted equally and I believe this was a true reflection of the mood of the country.

"(Nov 29, 2019  9:27 AM) Two K-pop stars will spend the next several years behind bars—punishment for raping women who were too drunk to resist. Jung Joon-young, a singer-songwriter who rose to fame on a TV talent show, and Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of the boy band FT Island, burst into tears Friday as they were sentenced to six and five years in prison, respectively, reports the New York Times.  The accused perpetrated sexual crimes against multiple women, degrading women and treating them as mere tools of sexual pleasure,  judge Kang Seong-soo said from Seoul Central District Court. He also said Jung  filmed [the victims] nude and having sex, then spread it on a group chat,  per the BBC. Police came across the videos while investigating another participant, K-pop star Seungri, charged earlier this year with supplying prostitutes to business investors. The judge said 30-year-old Choi  did not feel remorse after mass-raping drunken victims  in 2016. The 30-year-old Jung, who withdrew from the music industry after admitting to his actions in March, described  great remorse  in a final statement.  I deeply regret my foolishness,  he said. Both Jung and Choi are additionally required to complete 80 hours of sexual violence education and are prohibited from working with children. Still, they apparently maintain a fan base. In describing a culture of shaming victims, the BBC points to a  chat-room reaction  reading,  This is rather too much for this type of crime. These women were not kidnapped on the street, but followed the handsome singers.  However, the Guardian reports  most online commentators said the penalties were too lenient.

"(Oct 19, 2015  5:00 PM CDT) Hunters in Norway bagged two moose, somehow without realizing they were shooting at the animals through a fence. And not just any fence, but the fence of the Polar Park zoo, The Local reports. As the hunters explained to the zoo, their hounds somehow got inside the animals' enclosure and gave chase, and the hunters simply didn't realize the hounds were inside a zoo at the time.  I reacted with disbelief, and the first few seconds afterwards were pretty unreal,  says the zoo's chief executive.  I think this is very sad, and it’s not OK. We had five elks, now we have only three.  (As the San Francisco Chronicle explains, the animals are what North Americans call moose, but in Norway they're called elk. The zoo exhibits animals in  their natural surroundings,  the Chronicle further explains. While the zoo isn't pressing charges, it does intend to seek compensation. Beyond that, a wildlife tribunal chairman says the hunters shouldn't be punished.  This is a regrettable mistake made in connection with lawful hunting on the outside of the park,  he says.  It was a fatal error, but everyone understands that it was not done at all on purpose.  Police, however, are still investigating the incident, which happened Oct. 7, and one official says the hunter who fired the shot could be prosecuted, in which case he'd face a fine or jail, CNN reports.","Hunters Kill 2 Moose ...

According to Larry Brooks at the New York Post, the hockey team was the only one of the 123 teams that make up the Big Four North American Men’s Sports Leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL) to get a loan from the aid program, which was supposed to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll.

Outside magazine outlines the challenges faced by James Sharman as he prepped for a gourmet meal at Mount Everest's Base Camp in December, an endeavor attempted at least once before but abandoned when the chef took ill with altitude sickness. Not only did Sharman and his team have to learn in general about Nepalese delicacies like goat spinal cord and yak yogurt, which they weren't terribly familiar with: They also had to figure out how to keep the victuals fresh during the nine-day trek to Base Camp and how to set up an entire kitchen and dining area on the icy landscape.

The 62-30 vote to advance the measure to a final vote Wednesday gives both President Obama and Capitol Hill Democrats a much-needed victory—even though the $15 billion bill is likely to have only a modest boost on hiring. The bill featured four provisions that enjoyed sweeping bipartisan support, including a measure exempting businesses hiring the unemployed from Social Security payroll taxes through December and giving them another $1,000 credit if new workers stay on the job a full year.

"(Jul 23, 2015  1:12 AM CDT) They fought for $15—and they won. In what advocates say is a huge victory for the  99%-ers,  New York state's wage board has recommended that the minimum wage for fast-food workers be gradually hiked to $15 from the current $8.75 over the next few years, reports the New York Times, which notes that the nationwide fight for higher wages in the industry kicked off in New York City and has already succeeded in cities such as Los Angeles and Seattle. The board's recommendation, which applies to chains with more than 30 restaurants nationwide, calls for an increase to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018 and the rest of the state by the middle of 2021, the New York Daily News reports. The proposal—which is believed to be the first time a state has raised the minimum wage for a single industry—is almost certain to be approved by the state labor board, and it's expected to lead to pay raises in other industries and other states, the Times reports.  When New York acts, the rest of the states follow,  says Gov. Andrew Cuomo.  We've always been different, always been first, always been the most progressive.  The wage board approved the proposal after hearings in which fast-food workers described how much they had to do without to make ends meet in New York on $8.75 an hour, reports the Nation.

Administrators and the school resource officer reprimanded Sam and discussed punishment, forced him to write a  statement of guilt,  and never contacted his mother  even though Sam cried for about six hours straight,  she writes in a Washingtonian essay about the horror that unfolded next. After another harrowing meeting with an administrator and Sam writing an apology letter to the female student who had reported him, the teen lost his friends and lapsed into depression; even switching schools failed to improve things. Then he found new friends: communities on Reddit and 4chan that slowly pulled him into a fascination with the alt-right.  Those online pals were happy to explain that all girls lie—especially about rape. And they had lots more knowledge to impart,  the anonymous mother writes. That  knowledge  included anti-Semitic, anti-Islam, and anti-women views, a far cry from the  edgy and liberal  crowd Sam used to run with, not to mention the  kindness  and  gentleness  he had always displayed. Sam  researched  what he learned online, and started peppering his parents with comments like,  Feminists keep divorced dads from seeing their kids.  He became a moderator on his favorite subreddit, his new online pals having no idea he was so young. Through it all, his dismayed parents tried to remain neutral even while countering his arguments.

His identity may finally have come to light after two mushroom pickers say they found the camp of a man with a  dirty face and large beard  in a heavily wooded, remote location in the Maremma region, the Local reports. The mysterious stranger, a man in his mid- to late 40s, told the men and a local forest ranger they alerted that his name was Carlos, he was from Spain, and he'd been shacked up in the wilderness since 1997. And sure enough, the ID papers he brought out to show them (the Local mentions a passport, the Telegraph a university library card) listed him as Carlos Sanchez Ortiz de Salazar, a young doctor who had reportedly gone missing from his home in Seville in 1996 during a bout with depression and eventually been pronounced dead in 2010.

No one's sure what he would have eaten all this time, though the Telegraph reports the area he was in is rife with lots of deer and wild boar; other ideas floated in the Local speculate he may have learned to grow food or raided garbage cans in nearby towns at night.

The paper spoke with 38 women, 31 on the record, who say the longtime writer/director sexually harassed them on movie sets, during interviews, and even on the street, using his Hollywood credentials as a way to get them into abusive situations. Several of the women say Toback, who directed indie movies like Black & White and Two Girls and a Guy, would approach them on the street, brag about his friendship with Robert Downey Jr. or his Oscar nomination for writing the 1991 Warren Beatty film Bugsy, and then invite them somewhere under the auspices of interviewing them or having them read for a part in an upcoming film. Once they were alone, the women say Toback would quickly become inappropriate. One woman recounts walking down the street with Toback in Manhattan as he questioned her about masturbation and pubic hair. Many of the women describe experiences of Toback demanding they get naked and of him rubbing up against them to the point of ejaculation. These incidents stretch back decades, and other publications had previously published victims' accounts of Toback's behavior, including Gawker. But several of the women interviewed by the Times say they were inspired to come forward after news broke of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

There are a few other stipulations beyond money: A third offense would also result in a court-ordered drug assessment, and offenders under 21 would have to show up in court. Noting his own changing views, the Verge reports O'Malley calls the bill  an acknowledgment of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health.

Now, per People, the Tennessee Supreme Court has ruled that Cyntoia Brown, 30, must serve at least 51 years before she can get parole; she'd be 69 when eligible. It was a unanimous decision Thursday, CNN notes, after the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals asked the state Supreme Court to weigh in, as state law was unclear. The ruling was in response to Brown's argument that the US Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to give juveniles mandatory life sentences without parole (a lower court noted her life sentence did include the possibility of parole), as well as that it's  cruel and unusual punishment.  The appeals court rejected her first argument but is still reviewing the second. Brown was 16 when she killed Johnny Mitchell Allen in 2004, a real estate agent she says solicited her for sex after she was forced to serve as a prostitute by her boyfriend,  Kut Throat,  HuffPost notes. She contends she shot Allen after she saw him reach for a gun; prosecutors, however, said she was trying to rob Allen, and she was tried and convicted as an adult. Many are noting that Brown, a woman of color who says she killed in self-defense, is receiving a more severe punishment than whites who commit crimes.

"(Jun 3, 2016  12:09 PM CDT) Gold miners hoping to strike it rich in Peru appear to have inflicted the miserable side effect of mercury poisoning on an estimated 48,000 people. Peru's government declared a 60-day health emergency last month after Duke researchers analyzed hair from a sample of 3,000 Madre de Dios residents and found that 40% showed mercury levels above the maximum recommended by the WHO, reports Nature. The area has been booming, with gold production in March up 28% from a year previously. But to extract the gold, miners use a method involving mercury that results in about 40 tons of the latter being dumped into waterways annually. The Duke study suggests those with mercury poisoning—which can cause brain or kidney damage in severe cases—likely ate contaminated fish.  We now know with certainty what the source of the exposure is,  says Peru's deputy health minister.  We are not going to solve this in two months, or even in a year, but the Health Ministry has to start.  Under the health emergency, 25 villages spread across 33,000 square miles will receive food and medical aid, including canned fish, multivitamins to help with anemia, and perhaps quinoa, which researchers say may help lower mercury levels.

"(Aug 28, 2017  9:19 AM CDT) Meteorologists seem to be running out of adjectives to describe the devastation of Harvey, with phrases such as  beyond anything experienced  and  1-in-1,000 year event  being thrown around. But why is Harvey so bad? The New York Times explains that it involves an unusual combination of factors, the main ones being unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico and weak winds in the upper atmosphere that have allowed the storm to essentially park in place. On top of that, Galveston Bay is elevated because of the storm surge, which means the copious amount of rain falling on Houston isn't draining.  A 2- or 3-foot storm surge alone would not have been catastrophic,  a storm surge expert tells the newspaper.  It was all these ingredients coming together.  So how about the boogeyman of climate change? As the Atlantic explains, trying to show any such link is a tricky affair. But in a general sense, climate change makes ocean temperatures higher, which might have played a role in a unique Harvey phenomenon. Most hurricanes weaken as they approach land and churn up deeper, colder water. But Harvey actually intensified, in part because even the deeper water it was churning up was unusually warm.  This is the main fuel for the storm,  says Kevin Trenberth of US National Center for Atmospheric Research.  Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].",2 Big Factors Made Harvey So Potent,____ Big Factors Made Harvey So Potent,2,Copy( 2 ),0

It was the country's longest-ranging launch since it fired a satellite into orbit in 2012, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The launch came within hours of talks between the US, South Korea, and Japan in the Netherlands, the BBC reports; today is also the fourth anniversary of a South Korean warship's sinking. The South says it plans  countermeasures  alongside the UN. Recently, Pyongyang has fired a number of short-range missiles, the BBC notes.

A 40-year-old woman due to be married next month was shot to death by police Saturday night after she called 911 to report a noise in the alley near her house. In a release, the department said that the responding officers' body cameras were not turned on and that the shooting is under investigation. The Minneapolis Star Tribune quotes three sources who say that Justine Damond came out of the house in her pajamas when a police car arrived about 11:30pm Saturday and approached the driver's side. She was speaking to the driver when the officer in the passenger seat opened fire and shot her through the door, per the story. It's unclear whether it was accidental. Damond, a native of Australia, was a yoga instructor and meditation teacher, per her website. Her name was actually Justine Ruszczyk, but she had already begun using the name Damond.

Instead, phones using iOS 6 will be treated to Apple's own mapping system, and that's a very mixed bag, analysts tell the New York Times of the software update released yesterday. Sure, it looks nice; it zooms and pans faster and offers 3D overhead views of major cities. Plus, users can ask Siri for directions and get detailed, spoken guidance. But Apple's brand new system needs some serious tweaking. Notes an entrepreneur blogger: Apple has  used their platform dominance to privilege their own app over a competitor’s offering, even though it’s a worse experience for users.  For example, the app couldn't find  Heine Brothers  coffee shop when a user searched for  Heine Bros.  Nor was it able to identify Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. There's no public transportation information, and sometimes the app comes up with the wrong city in searches.  It takes a long time and effort to figure out how to do this right,  says a Google rep.

Engles was found by her mother-in-law, who lives in the house, when she arrived home late yesterday afternoon.

Ditko was found June 29 in his Manhattan apartment and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said, per the AP. No further details were available. Ditko, along with writer Stan Lee, introduced the world to Peter Parker and his alter-ego Spider-Man in 1962 in an issue of  Amazing Fantasy.  A year later, Ditko introduced the world to surgeon-turned-metaphysical superhero Doctor Strange. Spider-Man would go on to become arguably the most indispensable and recognizable character in the Marvel universe, and Doctor Strange a member of its permanent pantheon.

He began working in comics in the 1950s in New York, eventually landing a drawing job with Marvel forerunner Atlas Comics. Jack Kirby, Lee's artist on the Fantastic Four and many other Marvel characters, took a stab at creating Spider-Man in 1961, but Lee was unsatisfied and gave the gig to Ditko.

The 15-year-old New York City girl started Nannies by Noa in August 2012, and the New York Post figures a  conservative estimate  of $375,000 in revenue (without specifying a timeframe). CNN Money notes that as an 8th-grader, Noa was devoting 40 hours a week to her company. And so in July she hired a CEO to ease her  excruciating hours  dealing with  hundreds of emails  per day, she explains to the Post. That CEO, 26-year-old Allison Johnson, says that while  it was a little bit of a challenge at first  taking directions from a then-14-year-old, she's impressed with Noa's work ethic.  She'll get back to me during study hall. She can't shut off.  Nannies by Noa, which matches up families with babysitters and full-time nannies, was hatched when Noa, then a 6th-grader, realized she was always unhappy with her own caregivers and figured there had to be a better way.  For what you’re paying, your kids should be more stimulated,  she says, explaining that her company works with  engaged nannies who don't sit on the side at the playgrounds on their phones.  Those nannies go through an intense interview process—one 37-year-old tells the Post she had no idea she was being interviewed by a teen, and  was intimidated.

It still feels unreal sometimes because it is such an astronomical figure to me,  says Howaste Wikaya, a protester who set up the fundraising page. But Wikaya adds the money is spent practically the moment it's received: A local tribal historian tells the AP that only about $100,000 from the fund remained as of Friday night for the camp, situated near Cannon Ball where the Missouri and Cannonball rivers meet—and North Dakota's unforgiving winter is coming. Where the money has gone: groceries that run about $2,000 every two days, 20 yurts ($160,000 in total), and bail money (about $7,000 so far) for those arrested for protesting the $3.8 billion pipeline, which protesters say will disturb drinking water and plow through cultural artifacts of the nearby Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

While on an expedition in the Azores some 950 miles west of Portugal, as many as four beaked whales surfaced and spent about 10 minutes near a small inflatable boat, giving the instructors time to capture underwater footage of the whales. But not just any whales: A study in PeerJ reports they turned out to be the rarely seen True’s beaked whales, which were first described in 1912 and had never been filmed underwater. Only seven live sightings had previously been recorded—and New Scientist points out not all were verified—in part because of the elusive whales' behavior: a brief surfacing followed by dives that can last up to two hours and take the creatures as deep as two miles down. True’s beaked whales are identifiable by a white patch on their head that looks like a beanie, but the video shows new markings, including one with a white mask, reports Seeker. That discovery could be a sort of wrench, explains senior author Emma Carroll, who says  it might be more difficult to tell the different beaked whale species apart in the wild than previously thought  as the Cuvier's beaked whale bears similar coloration. But there's a flip side to the coin: More data on their markings could also make it easier for scientists to identify the whales. New Scientist explains that most such data to date comes from stranded whales, whose coloration can be darkened by the sun. Getting better at identifying them could allow scientists to do something they've never done before: estimate just how many True’s beaked whales are out there.

Employers added a solid 178,000 jobs in November, nearly matching the average monthly gains this year. Those gains point to the steady economic growth that President-elect Donald Trump is poised to inherit. Average hourly pay slipped, however, after a solid gain the previous month. Pay has increased at only a modest pace in the past year. The report's mixed signals illustrate the challenges facing Trump: On the surface, steady job gains and a low unemployment rate suggest the economy is healthy. But weak pay increases and fewer Americans working or looking for work point to longer-term challenges. Fewer than 60% of adults have jobs—3 percentage points lower than when the Great Recession began in late 2007. In part, that trend reflects retirements by the nation's many baby boomers. But it also means hiring hasn't kept up with population growth.

In the wake of that backlash, the company announced this week it will install a third, single-person restroom to the few hundred US stores that don't already have one by March 2017. The single-occupancy restrooms can be used by anyone.  At the end of the day, Target is all about inclusion,  a Target spokesperson tells CNN.  We want everyone to feel comfortable in our stores.  However, Target will still maintain its restroom policy for transgender customers. And that's a problem for groups like the American Family Association, whose spokesperson tells the Wall Street Journal it will continue to be a  bathroom free-for-all  at Target. The AFA claims more than 1.3 million people have signed an online petition to boycott Target. While Target has seen a 7% drop in sales this year, CFO Cathy Smith says that's not due to the boycott. She also says the addition of third restrooms to all Target stores was not a response to the boycott but something Target CEO Brian Cornell had already planned. Regardless, Target's announcement Wednesday was hailed by the National Center for Transgender Equality.",Target Hopes $20M Will Solve Transgender Bathroom Problem,Target Hopes $____M Will Solve Transgender Bathroom Problem,20,Copy( 20 ),0

The gunman—a local white man in his 20s—pointed a semiautomatic handgun at arriving officers, who fired, WXIN reports, though WNDU notes  several  rounds were exchanged between the man and police. The two victims—a staff member in her late teens or early 20s and a customer in her 40s—were found 10 to 12 aisles apart, making this a  huge crime scene,  a police spokesman says. The relationship between the victims and shooter, who was also carrying a large knife, isn't known, but  we are pretty confident that Elkhart's quick response to the scene most definitely saved lives tonight,  the spokesman said, adding,  There is not a day that goes by it seems anymore that we aren't learning about a school shooting or at a business. We hope this would never come to our hometown, and here it is.  One man, whose mother works at the store, said it was evacuated after gunshots were heard.

"(Dec 15, 2016  12:32 PM) Yahoo announced Wednesday that hackers lifted info from more than 1 billion accounts—said to be the largest single data breach ever of an email provider—and more bad news emerged later that day about who some of the account owners were. Per Bloomberg, upward of 150,000 military and government workers had accounts infiltrated in the August 2013 hack, meaning everything from names, telephone numbers, and birthdates to passwords, alternate email accounts, and security questions are  now in the hands of cybercriminals  and a national-security risk. The workers had provided their official government accounts to Yahoo as a backup in case their email became inaccessible. Account owners include everyone from FBI agents, White House staff (past and present), and service members from every branch to NSA and CIA employees, among others. This new info was discovered when cybersecurity researcher Andrew Komarov stumbled across a database of pilfered Yahoo user info being covertly sold online; he intercepted the database and alerted government officials (who, in turn, told Yahoo, which hasn't confirmed this report to Bloomberg). What this could mean for overseas spies is an easier time at their jobs, as they now may have an  alphabetized hit list of targets.  It could also throw a wrench in Yahoo's sale to Verizon.  We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions,  a Verizon rep tells the New York Times. Komarov doesn't think the hack was done by a foreign state, but by pros with potential spammer customers.

"(Oct 8, 2012  2:20 PM CDT) Rick Perry's solution for soaring education costs: get public universities to offer 4-year degrees for $10,000 or less. The Texas governor challenged state schools a year ago to create budget programs, and ten have responded—including Angelo State with a $9,974 degree and Texas A&M University-Commerce with a $10,000 degree in  organizational leadership.  How can they afford it? By increasing class sizes, granting credits more easily, and sometimes relying on big scholarships, the Wall Street Journal reports. But the scholarship plan leaves out too many students, critics say, and professors fear that students in low-cost programs will get crappy educations with part-time teachers. An expert at a Texas think tank, however, applauds Perry for spurring universities  to address the college affordability problem.  That problem, notes the Journal, stems from states cutting back on funding for higher education.

But the brightly-colored paintings and inscriptions are just part of the fascination.

In plastics, it's used to make materials more flexible. For bakers, it bleaches flour, making dough easier to work, and bread fluffier. ADA was thrust into the public eye earlier this month when FoodBabe.com launched a petition demanding that Subway stop using it.

Bourla sold shares worth $5.6 million as the company's stock price soared on Monday, but the company says it was part of a predetermined 10b5-1 plan for Bourla to sell off some of his Pfizer shares. A Pfizer spokeswoman tells CNN that the shares were sold because they hit a price set as part of a plan Bourla authorized in August.  These are predetermined plans managed through a third-party stock administrator,  the spokeswoman said when asked whether the CEO had considered delaying the sale.

"(Aug 19, 2015  8:24 AM CDT) In 2012 the average medical-school grad owed about $162,000 in student loan debt. But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans—in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the Journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10% of their discretionary income (that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line. And while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: Once they've borrowed $138,500 in government Stafford loans (that figure includes undergrad debt), the roughly 10-year-old Grad PLUS loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad PLUS was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments (which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10%) on time—at the taxpayers' expense. The Journal notes that 73% of America's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify.",How Many Plan to Pay $200K in Grad-School Debt: They Don't,How Many Plan to Pay $____K in Grad-School Debt: They Don't,200,"Paraphrase( 200,000 , K )",1

The Saudi Interior Ministry accused those arrested over the past few weeks of involvement in several attacks, including a suicide bombing in May that killed 22 people in the eastern village of al-Qudeeh. It was the deadliest militant assault in the kingdom in more than a decade. The Saudi crackdown underscores the OPEC powerhouse's growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS, which in addition to its operations in Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for recent suicide bombings aimed at Shiites in the kingdom's oil-rich east and in next-door Kuwait. The announcement comes a day after a powerful blast in neighboring Iraq killed more than 100 people in one of the country's deadliest single attacks since US troops pulled out in 2011. The Interior Ministry said that in June it thwarted a suicide bomb attack on a large mosque in eastern Saudi Arabia that can hold 3,000 worshippers, along with multiple planned attacks on other mosques and diplomatic and security bodies.

"(Jun 13, 2018  7:04 PM CDT) Civil rights advocates see this as a tale of two voters. Crystal Mason, who is black, was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a ballot in Tarrant County, Texas, in 2016 while being a felon under supervision. Terri Lynn Rote, who is white, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $750 fine for trying to vote for President Trump twice in Iowa. On Monday, the judge who sentenced Mason turned down her request for a new trial.  Prison is a lot closer for her today,  Mason’s lawyer told the New York Times. Mason, 43, had been sentenced to 60 months for tax fraud. She served part of her sentence and was released in 2016. She says she didn’t know that being a felon meant she was ineligible to vote. Her name had been purged from the voter rolls, and she was given a provisional ballot, which should have alerted her to her ineligibility, the prosecutor said. The judge had the option of sentencing Mason to anything from probation to 20 years, reported the Dallas Morning News in March. Whether a felon can vote varies by state. For example, as the New York Times notes, in Vermont, a person convicted of murder retains the right to vote, even while in prison. But in Mississippi, a conviction for perjury is enough to void the right to vote. Mason told the Star-Telegram that she was originally sent to jail for inflating returns and took responsibility for her actions.  I would never do that again. I was happy enough to come home and see my daughter graduate. My son is about to graduate. Why would I jeopardize that? Not to vote. ... I didn't even want to go vote.

"(May 16, 2012  8:54 AM CDT) Eduardo Saverin's decision to abandon the United States like an old MySpace account will save the Facebook co-founder at least $67 million in federal income tax, according to a Bloomberg analysis—and those savings will only grow in the not-unlikely event that Facebook stock soars. That's because Saverin will only pay an  exit tax  on his stake's September valuation (about $2.44 billion), even though it's grown since. But a Saverin spokesman says Bloomberg's figures are  erroneous  and that Saverin's departure  had nothing to do with tax.  Most people, of course, assume it did have something to do with tax, and many are furious.  It's ungrateful and it's indecent,  fellow immigrant Farhad Manjoo fumed in Pando Daily, saying Saverin owed America  nearly everything —let's not forget, US courts saved his Facebook stake, and its government created the Internet itself. But the Economist disagrees.  Facebook created wealth,  it argues.

"(Jan 9, 2019  9:44 AM) A California man was recently hit with three surprises: one, that he'd won big bucks from a lottery ticket; two, that the prize was way more than he thought; and three, that his roommate swiped it and tried to claim it as his own. The San Francisco Chronicle reports the swirl of activity started on Dec. 20, when the Vacaville resident forked over $30 for a scratch-off ticket  with hopes of winning a little extra cash for the holidays,  the Vacaville Police Department says in a Facebook post. The man discovered he'd won, and he went home and told his two roommates about the $10,000 he soon thought would be his. When he went to the local lottery office the next day to cash in the ticket, however, he was told a) the ticket wasn't a winner, and b) it had been altered. The man suspected the ticket wasn't the one he'd purchased, and that one of his roommates had taken the real ticket while he slept. He filed a police report, and sure enough, the next day his roommate, 35-year-old Adul Saosongyang, strolled into the lottery office with the ticket. There, another surprise came into play: The ticket was actually worth $10 million. The lottery office started a standard probe into all winnings over $600, got wind of the police report, and on Monday invited Saosongyang back to collect his prize—except instead of Saosongyang getting a payout, he was arrested on charges of grand theft. The Washington Post notes grand theft can be deemed either a misdemeanor (leading to up to one year in county jail with a conviction) or a felony (up to three years in state prison); it's not clear yet which Saosongyang will be hit with. As for the man who originally purchased the ticket, that's also unclear, though a Vacaville PD rep says,  I'm sure everything will work out in the end.",He Thought He Won $10K on a Scratch-Off.

Connor Sullivan, 17, vanished after first period at the Monta Vista High School campus in Cupertino last Monday and returned to his family on Thursday night, telling them he had been hiding at the school and surviving on fruit from surrounding trees and water from fountains, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. As his family pleaded for him to return home last week, deputies and hundreds of volunteers searched the area for the teenager. His family says he walked in the front door soon after friends brought over his favorite pizza. While his motivation for running away hasn't been reported, a police spokesman tells the Los Angeles Times that Connor, who slept under bleachers and used portable toilets,  did not want to be found.  He says the sheriff's office has looked into whether Connor's family can be ordered to reimburse the office for the search but hasn't found any law that allows it. In a statement released to KRON, the family thanks officials and volunteer searchers and says the teenager has  expressed the deepest sorrow and regret for his actions.

Joseph Orbeso, 21, and Rachel Nguyen, 20, of Orange County, Calif., haven't been seen or heard from since setting out on a hike on Thursday, park rep George Land tells the Orange County Register. Their car was found in the northwest area of the park on Friday after the owner of a bed and breakfast in which the couple were staying found they'd failed to check out. Fresh tracks leading from the vehicle suggested they headed north into a canyon, per NPR. However, the tracks also  indicate these people could be walking in circles,  says Land. Of particular concern is the temperature inside the park, which hit 100 degrees on Thursday. There's been no relief for 100 people and K-9 units who've scoured thousands of miles since then. As California Highway Patrol and the US Border Patrol provided air support on Monday, some rescuers even had to be removed from the park because of the heat, reports the Los Angeles Times. The search was scaled back Tuesday due to thunderstorms but was expected to resume Wednesday morning. It will continue until the end of the week, says Land, though he doesn't appear optimistic.

Per the AP, South Korea's military says that on Saturday, the North fired from its east coast what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The projectiles flew about 250 miles, with an apogee of 30 miles, per South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seoul's Blue House says the new tests were likely meant to be another sign of Kim Jong Un's displeasure with joint military drills that the US and South Korea are holding, as well as a test of how reliable the weapons are. The New York Times notes this latest launch comes just a day after President Trump told reporters at the White House he'd received a  beautiful  three-page letter from Kim on Thursday that was  very positive.  On Twitter Saturday morning, Trump expanded on the letter reportedly sent by Kim.  He stated, very nicely, that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over,  Trump posted.  It was a long letter, much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises. It was also a small apology for testing the short range missiles, and that this testing would stop when the exercises end.

He then went to great lengths to avoid prosecution—claiming to be a quadriplegic and even pretending he was comatose.

The lab, known by its French acronym CERN, said the findings were made by a team of scientists working on one of the four experiments at its Large Hadron Collider. The existence of pentaquarks was first proposed in the 1960s by American physicists Georg Zweig and Murray Gell-Mann, who coined the term  quark.  CERN likened previous attempts to prove the existence of pentaquarks to looking for silhouettes in the dark,  whereas LHCb conducted the search with the lights on, and from all angles.  A very scientific statement from Guy Wilkinson, a rep for the LHCb experiment team per the BBC:  The pentaquark is not just any new particle ... It represents a way to aggregate quarks, namely the fundamental constituents of ordinary protons and neutrons, in a pattern that has never been observed before in over fifty years of experimental searches. Studying its properties may allow us to understand better how ordinary matter, the protons and neutrons from which we're all made, is constituted.  Previous claims to the detection of pentaquarks have been refuted. The discovery, if verified, would be the second major find at the Large Hadron Collider.

"(Jan 2, 2019  7:21 AM) With 13 months to go until the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden hasn't confirmed whether he is planning a White House bid—but in some ways, the former vice president has been preparing for one since leaving office two years ago. In that time, Biden has managed to strike a balance between earning money and maintaining his ability to run for president without being labeled a corporate stooge, the New York Times reports. Biden has been paying the bills through a book deal and speaking engagements, but unlike Hillary Clinton, he hasn't been accepting paid speaking gigs for corporations or advocacy groups, spokesman Bill Russo says. Biden also doesn't consult or sit on corporate boards, Russo says. Biden has assembled what the Times calls a  campaign-in-waiting : a network of groups, including three foundations and a political action committee, staffed by well-paid former Biden aides and advisers. The Salt Lake Tribune notes that according to a public records request from the Times, Biden accepted a $100,000 engagement to speak at the University of Utah last month, but rejected the money when he found out it would come from taxpayer funds. At the university, he spoke of his early days in politics and the 2015 death of his son, Beau, but said nothing about a potential 2020 run. Biden, who turned 76 in November, is expected to announce a decision in the coming weeks.

One year after the photo was taken, Hurt tells NBC News that despite being  so hurt and embarrassed  police would make the photo public,  it was kind of a really big eye opener to see myself like that.  Hurt celebrated a year of sobriety last Sunday, posting the photo of  the absolute worst moment of my life  on Facebook to show  exactly what heroin addiction is  and to never  forget where the road of addiction has taken me.  Hurt first saw the photo on the news while she was in jail. At the time, she thought  it was terrible  that police would expose her like that.  Now, I do think it was a good thing, because I’m able to look back and see that's who I was, and that was the place it led to.

State officials and  a lack of adequate internal controls  are to blame, according to the state comptroller's report.  Suffice it to say that when thousands of inmates are collecting unemployment checks from behind bars, there is a serious gap in program oversight,  the comptroller said, adding that some agency programs just didn't check to see if recipients were in state or county prison, while others relied on newspaper reports rather than available databases.

"(Jun 26, 2012  1:00 AM CDT) It might be time to escape from New York. Scientists have discovered that the sea level along America's East Coast is rising as much as four times faster than the global average, reports the National Geographic. The findings mean places like Manhattan, Boston, Philly, and Baltimore could be in for a very wet future. A hike in sea level is expected as global warming continues and ice melts, but various coasts will be affected differently, depending on things such as ocean currents, local sea temperatures, salt levels, topography, and the shape of the Earth. US Geological Survey scientists found that sea levels from the 600-mile stretch of coast from Cape Hatteras in North Carollina to the Boston area climbed about 2 to 3.8 millimeters a year between 1950 and 2009. That compares with an average 0.6 to 1 millimeter increase annually over the same period globally. Researchers believe that level could rise by 7.8 to 11.4 inches by 2100—on top of the roughly 3 feet rise expected globally.

Eventually, you'll see coastal flooding events three to four times a year instead of once every three or four years.  And the impact will be felt inland, said another scientist.

"(Mar 22, 2018  1:51 PM CDT) Zei Uwadia is making history at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. The 16-year-old has been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, for more than 120 days, a record—the average patient is on ECMO, a form of life support that pumps blood out of the heart, removes carbon dioxide, adds oxygen, and pumps it back in, for just 21 days. But Zei has also set another, better record: She's the first patient at the hospital ever to walk while on life support, the Kansas City Star reports. The teen's journey began with unexplained back pain; suspecting a kidney infection, doctors put her on the antibiotic Bactrim. What happened next is not clear: Whether it was a reaction to Bactrim, a genetic lung condition (her younger sister has one), or something else as yet unrevealed by testing, one day soon after Zei started having trouble breathing. Her lung function continued to worsen until the ECMO became necessary. One of Zei's doctors told her mother, Brie Kerschen,  My vision for her is for her to be sitting up on the side of the bed, texting her friends, getting on the computer,  because he knew her chances of recovery would be better if she were alert and mobile, rather than sedated. One of the first signs that Zei would go even further than doctors expected was the day she asked for and ate tacos—most patients on ECMO are fed through a feeding tube or eat only soft foods, but not Zei. Still, no one expected her to walk. Her doctors wanted her to try getting into a chair or even standing, but she insisted on walking and eventually they let her. Since then, she's even lifted weights. A GoFundMe campaign for the family details her progress, both with walking and with answers—and continued questions—about her health. Her lung function is improving, and Kerschen tells CNN,  I really am convinced that [walking] saved her life, and not to be dramatic, but I think the fact that she's able to walk is why she's still here.

Consider that Connecticut won by 88, along the way setting a tournament record for total points (140) as well as all-time NCAA records for points in a quarter (55) and in a half (94), per the AP. Impressive, yes. But Josh Peter at USA Today has another word for it:  embarrassment.  He takes coach Geno Auriemma to task for reveling in the blowout afteward, with the coach explaining that  once the pace was established, it just became, for us, 'How many layups can we get? And how many open shots can we get?’  A record-setting amount, as it turned out. But  Auriemma, in unleashing his superior players, exposed what dilutes his accomplishments—the disparity between the best and the rest in women’s basketball is so significant, they could use a mercy rule,  writes Peter.

The suspects—who security services say pose a threat, but who can't be prosecuted because evidence against them is too sensitive to disclose in court—have received funds for accommodations, phone bills, and other expenses on top of welfare payments, the Telegraph reports. Opposition lawmakers say the sums paid out for living expenses are one of many reasons why the program, which currently includes 13 suspects, should be scrapped.

A 72-year-old woman found her elderly mother's body floating in the flooded basement of the older woman's Warren condo when she went to check on her, reports the AP. Police say it looks like Julia Sarno, 100, drowned after she either suffered a heart attack or perhaps fell while monitoring water levels in her basement, notes CBS Detroit. Another woman died—apparently of cardiac arrest—after she was pulled earlier this week from her water-stranded car in suburban Detroit. Monday's 4.57-inch downpour, which resulted in what Warren's mayor tells the AP  is going to go down as the great flood of 2014,  was Detroit's second-largest rainfall ever recorded in a single day—the record that stands at 4.74 inches was set in 1925, according to the National Weather Service's Detroit office.

According to Gizmodo, 195 countries signed a climate pact on Saturday to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. In two decades of climate conferences, this is the first to end in a successful agreement.  Our text is the best possible balance, a balance which is powerful yet delicate, which will enable each delegation, each group of countries, with his head held high, having achieved something important,  French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says. After the pact—the first to legally commit all countries to reducing carbon emissions—was signed, delegates from the 195 countries rose for a standing ovation, the BBC reports. The final agreement represents a compromise between developed and developing countries. Gizmodo reports it calls for nations to keep global warming  well below  2 degrees Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as a target. Countries  already feeling the impacts of climate change  had pushed for the lower limit. Developed countries will commit $100 billion per year to help developing countries, though that commitment isn't legally binding. According to the BBC, nations will have to report on their progress every five years. Gizmodo notes the most optimistic portion of the final agreement is a section calling for net zero carbon emissions sometime in the second half of the 21st century.

That's because Dr. Richard Shepherd, who the Daily Beast notes has performed more than 23,000 post-mortems, lent his expertise to the British police for an inquiry into the princess' death and is now coming forward with an interesting claim: that the injury Diana suffered in the accident was actually a minor one, and that the only reason it killed her was that it happened  in the wrong place.  Shepherd's assessment in his book, Unnatural Causes, which has been excerpted by the Daily Mail, notes that Diana suffered a  few broken bones  in the Paris collision, but it was a  tiny tear  in one of her veins that proved fatal—a  specific injury ... so rare that in my entire career I don't believe I've seen another.  That's because veins bleed out much more slowly than arteries, which could explain why Diana was reportedly still conscious immediately after the accident. The problem was that the torn vein was buried deep in her chest, Shepherd says, meaning it simply wasn't discovered in time to save her.  If only she had hit the seat in front at a slightly different angle,  Shepherd writes.  If only she had been thrown forward 10mph more slowly.  And then, the one factor Shepherd says Diana actually could've controlled:  If only she had been wearing a seat belt.

The man from Long Beach, Calif., was keeping the secret stash to surprise his wife, Linda, with a dream trip to Italy after he retired in 2018, the Orange County Register reports. For six years, Hoffman, 65, had been padding the wad, which he had kept in a bank account. He withdrew the cash earlier this month with the intention of helping out a relative who had fallen on hard times. In the meantime, he tucked in an envelope in the pocket of an orange shirt deep in his closet. Then he forgot about it until he had another $100 to contribute. Hoffman remembered that two days earlier his wife was making a Goodwill run and he helpfully offered to donate a bunch of old shirts. In the pile was the cash-stuffed orange shirt. Hoffman confessed his botched romantic plan to his wife, and the pair raced to the charity shop. But there no trace of the shirt.  Bob is an extremely strong human being,  Linda Hoffman tells the Register.  I don’t want to hurt his male ego ... but he was crying.  They went home and prayed.

"(Dec 4, 2013  11:49 AM) A new poll has some worrying news for a president long popular with young people. Some 52% of 18- to 24-year-olds would vote to recall President Obama if that were an option, Mediaite reports. Just 41% of 18- to 29-year-olds, or millennials, approve of the job he's doing in office. And while 55% of that group voted for Obama last year, just 46% would today. The Harvard poll also paints a bleak picture for supporters of ObamaCare, Fox News notes. Just 22% of the 18-to-29 crowd intend to enroll in ObamaCare. Among uninsured millennials, just 29% plan to get signed up. That's a real problem for a program that  depends upon  healthy young people's premiums to help pay for less healthy individuals, notes a pollster.

Former professor Wyndham Lathem and Oxford University financial officer Andrew Warren face Chicago arrest warrants accusing them of murder in the July 27 fatal stabbing of 26-year-old Trenton Cornell-Duranleau. Cornell-Duranleau suffered  lacerations and mutilations to his body, his upper body, but not to the point of decapitation,  police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. He described the attack as  certainly very intense,  reports the AP. Authorities have said the attack on Cornell-Duranleau, a Michigan native who moved to Chicago last year, was so brutal that the blade of the knife that investigators believe was used in the stabbing was broken. When police found him, he had already been dead for at least 12 hours.  We've been looking a great deal, not only at the relationship between Dr. Lathem and the victim, but also the connection between all three,  he said.

Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Minnesota have all gone blue since at least 1988—and Minnesota has the longest blue streak of any state, going the way of the Democrats since 1972. Still, Republicans tell the Washington Post the states may be within reach for Romney, and his campaign has been advertising in both Pennsylvania and Minnesota; GOP super PACs have sunk dollars into all three.  Can we win all of them? Probably not,  says a top Romney adviser of the trio of states.  Can we win some of them? I think probably so.  The Obama campaign is countering with ads of its own in the three states, and staffers say they aren't worried, suggesting that Romney is pursuing the states because he can't win the real swing states.

"(Dec 5, 2014  9:00 AM) Authorities ordered an investigation today after at least 24 poor and elderly people went blind following cataract surgeries performed at a free medical camp run by a charity in northern India. The operations were performed in early November on 130 patients who were all older than 50 and living in either Amritsar or nearby Gurdaspur, in Punjab state, an official says. Some of the patients reported this week that they'd lost their eyesight or were suffering infections. Doctors in Amritsar are treating some of the patients, but they say it's unlikely any will regain their sight. Police have launched an investigation and detained at least one doctor in Gurdaspur. Every year, thousands of people, especially in rural areas without proper health facilities, undergo cataract operations in medical camps held by health authorities and welfare groups. The case once again highlights the perilous state of health care in India, where hundreds of millions of poor people without access to doctors or health insurance are forced to seek treatment at medical camps because of poor services and corruption at government hospitals. Last month, 13 women died after allegedly taking tainted drugs after undergoing simple sterilization surgeries.

The blistering editorial calls such firearms  weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection  and urges Americans to direct their anger at the leaders are supposed to keep them safe but  place more importance on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms.  The Times says that instead of just stopping the spread of firearms, it is time to talk about  eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition,  like the  slightly modified combat rifles  used in the San Bernardino shootings.  It is possible to define those guns in a clear and effective way,  the Times writes,  and, yes, it would require Americans who own those kinds of weapons to give them up for the good of their fellow citizens.

But now it's stopping work altogether, claiming the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority owes it upward of $83 million, ABC News and the AP report.  We stopped because … lack of payment with (Prepa) has gotten beyond its maximum threshold and what we can sustain as a business,  Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski tells CNN. But Prepa, whose director resigned Friday over the contract scandal, says it's not paying until it can resolve an issue between Whitefish and an unnamed Whitefish subcontractor. Prepa claims it received  a communication  from the subcontractor  requesting the stoppage of any payment  to Whitefish over non-payment to the subcontractor. Only about half of the island's power grid is back online two months after the hurricane, though CNN notes that doesn't mean half of the island's customers are with power.

It may have not been the best business decision coming to work for a bankrupt island,  Techmanski tells CNN, adding that he thought FEMA would help ensure his firm would get paid. He says he hopes the payment can be worked out so that Whitefish can wrap up its work there through the end of November.

A few years later, he was thrown into jail for protesting British colonialism, which is when he stepped up his workout regime—despite having no equipment, he would exercise up to 12 hours a day.  It was in the jail that I began weight training seriously. This helped me prepare myself for the world championship,  says Aich. At just 4-feet-11, Aich is one of the shortest Mr. Universe winners ever. He credits a simple diet of milk, fruits and vegetables, rice, lentils, and fish for his long life, along with keeping a positive attitude.  I never allow any sort of tension to grip me. I had to struggle to earn money since my young days, but whatever the situation, I remained happy,  Aich said.","Former Mr Universe Turns 100, Credits Positivity","Former Mr Universe Turns ____, Credits Positivity",100,Copy( 100 ),0
"(Dec 29, 2020  4:06 PM) A 500-year-old church bell will be returned to its former home in Poland some 77 years after it was stolen by the Nazis. Nazis made off with an estimated 80,000 bells, most of which were melted down for their metal and used to make weapons and ammunition during World War II, reports the BBC. By the end of war, about 1,300 bells remained intact. But they weren't returned to the churches. Instead, they landed in a  bell cemetery  in Hamburg, at least initially, per the BBC. More than a half-century later, Marian Bednarek, the pastor of St Catherine's church in Slawiecice, Poland, set out to find out what became of his church's old bell. From a mention in a book, he learned the bell, dated to 1555, had been sitting in plain sight in the courtyard of a Catholic Church in Munster, Germany, alongside two other bells. The German diocese claims the bells were loaned out to parishes across former West Germany after World War II as the British military blocked the return of the bells to eastern territories. Now the property of the German government, the bell of St Catherine's church will be returned on a permanent loan once the coronavirus pandemic settles down.  After 77 years, waiting another month or so doesn't really matter,  a former Slawiecice resident says, per the BBC.",Pastor Finds 500-Year-Old Church Bell Taken by Nazis,Pastor Finds ____-Year-Old Church Bell Taken by Nazis,500,Copy( 500 ),0
"(Jul 18, 2017  8:58 AM CDT) A second Australian senator in less than a week has announced she's quitting Parliament after discovering she's a dual national and had therefore never really been elected. Larissa Waters, co-deputy leader of the minor Greens party, said Tuesday that she's quitting after six years as a senator after the Canadian High Commission in Canberra told her that she's Canadian, the AP reports. The Guardian notes that Waters, who said she was filled with  shock and sadness  over the news, was  visibly emotional  when she offered her apologies for not carrying out extensive-enough checks on her own background before running for office.  I had not renounced since I was unaware that I was a dual citizen,  she said.  I take full responsibility for this grave mistake and oversight.  On Friday, the Greens' other co-deputy, Scott Ludlam, revealed that he was a citizen of New Zealand as well as Australia—he moved to Australia when he was 3—which made him ineligible for the Senate job he's held since July 2008.  It wasn't the way I was hoping to go out,  he told reporters, per the Guardian.  There is an enormous amount of work left undone.  Australia's constitution states a  citizen of a foreign power  is not eligible to be elected to Parliament.

"(Aug 16, 2016  6:52 AM CDT) In an attempt to bury a relic of its past, Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than $1 million to remove the word  Confederate  from one of its dorms, the Tennessean reports. Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos called the inscription on Confederate Memorial Hall  a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.  The Nashville university's efforts to change the name in 2002 were halted when the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued. The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good.  It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,  Zeppos told the Tennessean.  And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.  Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports. Efforts by Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from a building could face a tougher climb under the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, which now requires a vote of two-thirds of the state’s Historical Commission rather than a simple majority.",Vanderbilt to Pay $1.2M to Zap 'Confederate' Name,Vanderbilt to Pay $____M to Zap 'Confederate' Name,1.2,Copy( 1.2 ),0

Police say five of the inmates who escaped from the Cocke County Jail Annex in Newport were recaptured, but one, 54-year-old David Wayne Frazier, is still on the run and is considered to be dangerous, ABC News reports. He was being held on charges of aggravated robbery and being a felon in unlawful possession of a weapon. Police say one escaped inmate was caught at a home, another was captured after a foot chase, another was arrested after a patrolman spotted him in a vehicle, a fourth was arrested by an undercover narcotics officer, and the father of a fifth persuaded him to turn himself in Monday night, reports CBS News. Several people found with the escapees were also arrested. The sheriff's department says that to make their escape at around 1:30am Christmas morning, the men simply pulled the toilet out of the wall and  gained access to a hole which led outside of the facility,  the Knoxville News Sentinel reports. A water leak had rusted the bolts connecting the unit to the wall and damaged the concrete behind it. Another 17 men stayed behind in the dormitory-style cell. Sheriff Armando Fontes says that after getting through the hole, the men only had to kick down a tin door and climb a fence to escape.

"(Jul 16, 2016  5:47 AM CDT) Forces loyal to Turkey's president say they quashed a coup attempt in a night of explosions, air battles, and gunfire that left dozens dead as Saturday dawned. Authorities arrested thousands of people as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed those responsible  will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey,  the AP reports. Gen. Umit Dundar, the newly appointed acting chief of the general staff, said officers from the Air Force, the military police and the armored units, were mainly involved in the attempt. The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the military, and Turkey's main opposition parties quickly condemned the attempted overthrow of the government. Turkish Prime Minister Benali Yildirim said 161 people had been killed and 1,440 wounded in the overnight violence. He said 2,839 plotters had been detained. Yildirim described the night as  dark stain for Turkish democracy  and said the perpetrators  will receive every punishment they deserve.  Fighting continued into the early morning, with the sounds of huge blasts echoing across Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, including at least one bomb that hit the parliament complex. Television footage showed images of broken glass and other debris strewn across a lobby leading to the assembly hall. The chaos capped a period of political turmoil in Turkey—a NATO member and key Western ally in the fight against ISIS—which critics blamed on Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule. He has shaken up the government, cracked down on dissidents and opposition media, and renewed conflict in the mainly Kurdish areas of the southeast.","Turkey: 161 Dead, Thousands Arrested as Coup Quashed","Turkey: ____ Dead, Thousands Arrested as Coup Quashed",161,Copy( 161 ),0
"(Jan 27, 2015  4:04 PM) Japan is grappling with a mysterious problem among young people. Some 500,000 to 2 million are affected by a condition that leaves them unable to leave the house—or even their rooms—for years at a time. It's called hikikomori, a word that has been commonplace in Japan since the 1990s, though a few cases have also been seen in the US and other countries.  If you ask people in Japan about hikikomori, almost everyone will say, 'I know somebody like that,'  a psychologist said in the Japan Times last year. It's considered by many to be one of the country's top health issues, but what is going on, and whether those considered to be hikikomori are living with a mental illness, remains unclear, the Wall Street Journal reports. Treatment of the condition, which often affects young men, has been elusive. Every prefecture is legally required to have a treatment center, but few hikikomori actually visit them, and even when they do, few receive successful care. Now, international researchers are trying to understand the condition in the city of Fukuoka. As it stands, just half of hikikomori would likely receive a psychiatric diagnosis in the US, but a US researcher working with the Fukuoka team developed new criteria for the condition in 2010, the Journal notes. Experts are using that criteria to help develop a better understanding of the situation in a country where, the Times noted, mental illness remains highly stigmatized.

David Rogers tells the Sun Sentinel that he can still recall hearing his grandmother scream as she read the telegram informing the family that Gavrin had gone missing during the battle of Saipan, sometime between June 15 and July 9. There were no further details, only speculation on the family's part: that he drowned while being pushed into the ocean, or was a victim of a Japanese suicide attack. And there hadn't been any details since, until a former enemy offered some unlikely help. Japan's Kuentai Group is attempting to find some 1 million missing Japanese soldiers, and they found mass graves in Saipan's caves. One contained US remains—and Gavrin's dog tags. The information imprinted on them led the group to a Virginia library, and public records then led to his surviving relatives; Rogers says he's the  only living relative to have known my Uncle Bernie.  The unearthing of the dog tags resulted in Gavrin being awarded seven new awards in addition to his Purple Heart. Genetic testing is under way on the remains; it may take a year to determine whether Gavrin's are among them.

But Sanders writes for NPR that while the past 12 months may indeed deserve a spot in the midst of a white-hot dumpster fire, 2016 may not have actually been as bad as all that—and  it surely can't be the worst year of all time,  he notes. He runs through things that many Americans can be thankful for, including a recovering economy, our relatively safe existence, and, yes, for Trump supporters, a satisfying conclusion to Election 2016. Plus, much of the  '2016 is awful' rhetoric  was helped along by what Nikki Usher, a George Washington University media professor, calls  ambient journalism,  a nonstop engagement with online news and headlines via social media that basically,  over time … becomes an assault.   Every five minutes, another sad headline, another Twitter mention or fight, another shared link on Facebook, another push notification. Another hit,  Sanders writes. Combine that with this year's seemingly prevailing narrative—that of  a nation, and even a world, completely and disastrously divided, perhaps beyond repair —and it's easy to see why 2016 has earned its black-sheep status on the calendar.  Lots of crappy, bad things happen every year, but you aren't told over and over again that this just shows us how bad everything is,  Usher notes.

The Telegraph reports that middle school and high school teachers there have been issued a manual to use while teaching a new subject for 2015:  Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities.  The manual contains details of Kim Jong Un's childhood—specifically, the amazing story of how he was driving by age 3, per YTN TV.

At the age of 9, Kim Jong Un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company who was visiting North Korea at the time,  one of the passages reportedly reads (he won that race  despite the odds,  per Metro).

After the G7 offered $22 million to help Brazil fight the fires, a spokesman for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro rejected the offer and mocked the French leader, the BBC reports.

Among all registered voters, which includes those who might sit this one out, the president leads 52% to 43%.  Likely voters have traditionally been a more Republican group in past elections because they tend to turn out in higher numbers than Democrats, and 2012 looks like it is no exception,  says CNN's polling chief.

"(Aug 28, 2017  8:56 AM CDT) He has been convicted of killing two and attempting to murder two more—and he could actually be  Germany's worst post-war killer,  reports the BBC. Niels Hoegel, 40, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for those crimes, but prosecutors voiced their belief that the nurse had killed many more while working at clinics in Oldenburg (from 1999 to 2002) and Delmenhorst (from 2003 to 2005), reports the AP. Now police are giving a sense of just how many more: at least 84. Hoegel said at trial that he wanted to play the hero and drugged his patients so that he could then resuscitate them and win praise. Except a commission established three years ago to determine the breadth of his crimes has found that many patients ended up receiving lethal doses of drugs that brought on heart failure or destroyed the circulatory system. The BBC reports that 134 bodies have been exhumed and tested for traces of the drug, but  it is simply not possible to say how many people were killed,  per Oldenburg police chief Johann Kuhme. That's in part because many of his patients were cremated. The AFP quotes chief police investigator Arne Schmidt as describing the death toll as  unique in the history of the German republic.  There is  evidence for at least 90 murders,  he said at a press conference,  and at least as many [suspected] cases again that can no longer be proven.  Kuhme faulted the clinics for having  hesitated to alert authorities,  saying the death toll could have been much lower if they had. New charges against Hoegel will likely be filed next year.

On top of that, families of kids who survived the classroom attacks would receive $20,000 each, and the two wounded teachers would split $150,000, the Hartford Courant reports. The plan should be settled by Monday, says a lawyer involved. The decisions follow a private meeting with families run by a former federal judge, then a public hearing last night on the matter.

An Illinois woman is suing Starbucks for $5 million, claiming the company misrepresents the size of its cold drinks by including a hefty amount of ice, the Huffington Post reports. Take the company's 24-ounce Venti cold drink:  A Starbucks customer who orders a Venti cold drink receives only 14 fluid ounces of that drink—just over half the advertised amount, and just over half the amount for which they are paying,  says the 29-page complaint filed by Stacy Pincus, per Courthouse News. In other words, the suit says,  Starbucks is advertising the size of its cold drink cups on its menu, rather than the amount of fluid a customer will receive ... and deceiving its customers in the process.  What's more, the complaint notes that Starbucks charges less for comparable hot drinks even though they contain more coffee—apparent evidence of Starbucks making too much from cold drinks. The class-action suit aims to represent customers who bought a Starbucks cold drink over the past 10 years and levels a handful of accusations, including negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and unjust enrichment.

The Detroit Free Press reports that nearly 80% of those have voluntarily left the country. The Homeland Security Investigations Detroit office told the newspaper Tuesday that about half of those remaining have received final orders of removal; others are appealing their removal, and one has been granted lawful permanent resident status.

"(Dec 22, 2014  6:21 AM) The winter solstice officially occurred at 6:04pm EST yesterday, marking the first day of winter and the longest night of the year. But all  longest nights  aren't created equal, and the longest night in Earth's history likely happened in 1912. Here's why: The Earth's rotation has been slowing a little bit every year since the planet formed some 4.5 billion years ago, and we have a phenomenon known as tidal acceleration to thank. The moon's gravity pulls on our oceans, tugging the oceans that face it into a  bulge  (LiveScience digs into why there's a bulge on the other side, too). But as the Earth rotates, that tidal bulge is pushed to a position just ahead of the point of our planet that's directly below the moon. That causes the Earth to experience  just a bit of friction from this bulge of water as it rotates, slowing it down slightly,  explains Vox. And as a NASA article explains, as Earth slows, the moon is able to inch away from us. The effects of these things are so tiny it takes atomic clocks to spot them, but they're very gradually making our nights longer—mostly. In the long view, we're slowing, but geological factors (like ice melting at our poles, for instance) can impact the rotational speed, and as this University of California Observatories graph shows, the length of our day has gone infinitesimally up and down over the last century, but the peak—and therefore the longest night in our history—occurred in 1912. As far as the length of last night goes, it depends on where you spent it, notes the Washington Post. Washington, DC, saw about 9.5 hours of daylight yesterday, while Miami got almost 10.5, and Fairbanks, Alaska, saw less than four.

That price puts Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, reports the AP, double that of rival Walmart and more than 15 times the size of Target. And its four-digit stock price places it in rare company: Only four other US-listed companies have shares that trade above $1,000, and the only other S&P 500 company valued at more than $1,000 a share is Priceline, which traded at about $1,863 on Tuesday.

"(Mar 19, 2012  7:56 AM CDT) Apple shareholders ought to be even happier with the company than usual this morning, as the gadgets giant announced plans to spend $45 billion of its $97 billion in cash reserves on a buyback and a dividend program. Of that, $10 billion will go to a buyback authorization—though Business Insider cautions that Apple has merely given itself the option to buy back shares, not actually committed to doing so. The rest of the money will go to a $2.65-per-share quarterly dividend, which will start in its fiscal fourth quarter, which begins July 1. It's the first dividend Apple has offered since 1995, notes CNN. CEO Tim Cook promised that the plan wouldn't hurt Apple's investments in research and development, retail stores, and other companies.  Even with these investments, we can maintain a war chest for strategic opportunities and have plenty of cash to run our business,  he said in a statement. On a conference call, Cook added that the moves would bring in new investors who only buy dividend-yielding stocks, according to Bloomberg.",Apple to Pay First Dividend Since 1995,Apple to Pay First Dividend Since ____,1995,Copy( 1995 ),0

I actually adopted two sons last year,  she said, though it was soon made clear that she hadn't needed to stock up on diapers and baby bottles.  They were 18—they're both 19 years old now,  she elaborated. Sia explained that they were  aging out of the foster care system,  then sweetly added,  Yeah, and I love them.  This isn't the first time Sia has mentioned being a parent, per USA Today, which notes she brought it up in January during an interview with GQ. She mentioned to the magazine then that she'd recently texted the DJ Diplo and said,  Hey, listen, you're like one of five people that I'm sexually attracted to, and now that I've decided to be single for the rest of my life and I just adopted a son, I don't have time for a relationship. ...

Spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement that a single airstrike on Feb. 3 killed 10 operatives in a building used as an al-Qaeda meeting site. A second strike the next day killed Abu Hani al-Masri, identified by the Pentagon as a  legacy  al-Qaeda terrorist who oversaw the creation and operation of al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s. Davis said al-Masri had ties to bin Laden and to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who became the top leader of al-Qaeda when bin Laden was killed by US forces in 2011. He  was also one of the founders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the first Sunni group to use suicide bombers in their terror attacks,  the Pentagon statement said.

"(Aug 16, 2018  8:12 AM CDT) Three letters over the last three days. That's how many messages House and Senate Democrats have penned this week demanding the US be forthcoming with information on its involvement in Yemen after an airstrike there last week killed at least 40 kids. Critics say there could be thousands of civilian deaths that the US could be tied to, spurring the Dems' notes to officials at the DOD and State Department and in US intelligence, the Washington Post reports. The letters, including one written Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, request details on US involvement in the conflict that has pitted Shiite Houthi rebels against a Saudi-led coalition that's in support of the Yemeni government. In her letter, Warren pressed Gen. Joseph Votel, the chief of US Central Command, on whether the US has been lending a hand in any airstrikes that have resulted in civilian deaths. A second letter by 30 House Democrats has also demanded a briefing of the war from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and DNI chief Dan Coats, while a third letter by Rep. Ted Lieu wonders whether the US has violated any US or international laws. New data cited by the Guardian says there have been more than 50 strikes against civilian vehicles in Yemen so far in 2018. The New York Times calls the latest airstrike that resulted in  44 small graves   particularly shocking,  and frames US military leaders as  exasperated  by the civilian toll and insistent that  the United States is not a party to the war ; critics counter that the US has sold the coalition weapons and given it intel. The Times notes that both Mattis and Pompeo took action to press Saudi officials on the attack, including a call from Mattis to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.","After Child Deaths in Yemen, Democrats Write 3 Letters","After Child Deaths in Yemen, Democrats Write ____ Letters",3,Trans( Three ),1

June Rountree was beginning to lose hope that she'd ever see her dog, Abby, again after the 4-year-old lab-pitbull mix slipped out of her collar in the backyard of Rountree's Dothan home on Nov. 8, per the Dothan Eagle. The 60-year-old Rountree had searched the neighborhood for Abby, who was a stray when she was adopted three years ago, and checked the local animal shelter without success. Heartbroken, she carried on with her life, never expecting Abby would be the one to find her. That's exactly what happened Saturday as Rountree was working a shift as a cashier at a Walmart almost two miles from her home, per the Eagle and Washington Post. Suddenly, a black and white dog raced into the store. Danielle Robinette, another employee, spotted the collarless dog running around, tailed by a security guard. The pooch  would just stop and look up at people,  she tells the Eagle.  It looked like she was looking for someone.  Then she found Rountree.  I completely lost it,  the owner tells the Post.

Over the decade Rountree has worked at the Walmart, she had brought Abby to the parking lot and to the nearby woods, but never into the store itself. One theory is that Abby was roaming when she came across the familiar location, separated from Rountree's home by two busy roads.

"(Dec 18, 2012  11:31 AM) The US government has slapped Toyota with a record $17.4 million fine for failing once again to quickly report problems to federal regulators and for delaying a safety recall. The fine from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the maximum allowed by law. It's the fourth fine levied against Toyota in the past two years for similar infractions, and it's the largest single fine ever assessed against a car company over safety defects. In 2010, Toyota paid a total of $48.8 million in fines for three violations. The latest fine stems from a June recall of SUVs from Toyota's Lexus luxury brand. About 154,000 of the 2010 Lexus Rx 350s and RX 450h models were recalled because the driver's-side floor mats can trap the gas pedal and cause the vehicles to speed up without warning. The problem was similar to troubles from 2010 that prompted a series of embarrassing safety recalls by the company. The fine is a tiny fraction of Toyota's earnings. The company, which this year regained its position as the world's biggest automaker, posted a $3.2 billion profit in the third quarter alone.",Feds Fine Toyota $17.4M for Pokey Safety Response,Feds Fine Toyota $____M for Pokey Safety Response,17.4,Copy( 17.4 ),0

Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work,  he wrote.  Premiums & deductibles are far too high.  He said the GOP is working on a better, cheaper solution, adding,  Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.  The tweets come after a week in which Trump's White House got newly aggressive against ObamaCare, first by arguing in court that the entire law should be declared unconstitutional. Then Trump himself promised that the GOP  will soon be known as the party of health care.  However, Politico reports that GOP leaders made clear to the White House they did not want to make ObamaCare a focal part of the 2020 election, because they were hurt on the issue in the midterms. As Bloomberg points out, the law has gradually become more popular with voters. Democrats already have seized on the administration's aggressive court strategy and are planning a resolution to condemn an  unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people,  per USA Today. That would force House Republicans, assuming they back the president, to go on the record as agreeing with the strategy to kill the entire law.

Peter Kema Sr., wearing a jail jumpsuit and shackles, agreed to the move as part of a plea deal reached earlier this month, Hawaii County Prosecuting Attorney Mitch Roth tells the AP. Kema pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a 20-year sentence, on the condition that he reveal where the remains are.

The seventh Star Wars movie is the highest ever grossing film in the North American market, where it was released three weeks ago. But internationally, it still has a long way to go to beat James Cameron's science-fiction movie with blue aliens. The international box office of Force Awakens stands at $1.6 billion, compared to the $2.8 billion Avatar made in 2009.

The Syrian soldiers (Reuters reports the group also included government employees) had sought refuge in Iraq after the Syrian side of the border crossing was seized by the opposition; the group was being escorted back into Syria when they were attacked with bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, and guns. The identities of the gunmen aren't known, but officials have accused al-Qaeda in Iraq of planning the ambush, since Syrian rebels were unlikely to have been able to cross the border and carry out the attack. Sporadic clashes between the Syrian army and the opposition have been reported near the Rabiya border crossing, where the Syrian soldiers initially sought refuge, and a number of Syrians have sought refuge in Iraq. Officials have been concerned about the violence spilling over into Iraq for some time; on Friday a rocket reportedly hit Iraq from Syria, but no injuries were reported.",49 Syrian and Iraqi Troops Killed in Border Ambush,____ Syrian and Iraqi Troops Killed in Border Ambush,49,"Add( 42 , Trans( seven ) )",1

"(Mar 13, 2019  6:33 AM CDT) President Trump's first veto is on the horizon. The Senate will vote Wednesday on a resolution demanding that the US end its military support of the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen. The bipartisan resolution invoking the War Powers Act, seen as a rebuke of Trump, passed 56-41 in December following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but the Republican-controlled House did not take it up. It did pass the Democrat-controlled House last month, but will be voted on again. Citing  senators' rising anger  over a lack of accountability in the killing, the New York Times reports the resolution is expected to pass, though perhaps with fewer Republican votes than in December, when the White House warned of a presidential veto. It said the resolution  would harm bilateral relationships in the region and negatively impact the ability of the United States to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations,  per Politico. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a co-sponsor along with Republican Sen. Mike Lee, instead called it  enormously important and historic  in a Tuesday statement.  The humanitarian catastrophe has only gotten worse in Yemen, and our intervention there is every bit as unconstitutional as it was then,  he said. If the resolution gets Trump's first veto, the second shouldn't be far off. Trump has said he will veto a resolution overturning the national emergency declaration to secure funding for his border wall, which the Senate votes on Thursday. More on that here.

(On Sept. 11 of that year, as a matter of fact.) So how goes the case? ABC News reports that both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar are now potential suspects, based on unspecified  forensic hits  cited by its anonymous sources. Cell phones records also suggest the brothers were in the vicinity the day of the murder. Definitive DNA testing is apparently still under way, however, and the rest of the case amounts to a mishmash of admittedly thin circumstantial evidence: Friends thought Tamerlan was acting strange after the murder of his friend, for instance. One other tenuous link: The brothers may have worked as deliverymen for the pizzeria where the victims ordered their last meal (the employee who tried to deliver the order that night says no one answered the door). The store denies it, but acquaintances of the brothers remember differently.

"(Jul 30, 2013  3:24 PM CDT) Fast-food workers want to make a  living wage  of $15 an hour. Chains say they'd have to jack up prices if that ever happened. But just how high? Turns out, not as high as you might think, at least according to a University of Kansas researcher. He found that if McDonald's immediately doubled the wages of all its workers (including the $9 million CEO), it would have to raise the price of a Big Mac 68 cents, from $3.99 to $4.67, reports the Huffington Post. Items on the Dollar Menu technically wouldn't qualify anymore, but that hike is relatively modest as well, to $1.17.  Some folks online are complaining they will not pay $2 for their Dollar Menu, but the truth is that even if McDonald’s doubled salaries the price hike would not be 100%,  says research assistant Arnobio Morelix, who crunched numbers from the chain's annual reports and investor data, reports Forbes. He found that for every dollar McDonald's earns, about 17 cents goes to wages and salaries. Yes, a 68-cent Big Mac bump might be a lot for low-income diners, writes Aimee Picchi at MSN Money. But the nation as a whole might be better off, she writes, noting that minimum wage workers often need food stamps and other aid.

"(Jan 31, 2020  3:05 PM) Doctors were stumped when five babies struggled to breathe at a German hospital. Then came urine tests, a police probe, and a painful find: breast milk mixed with morphine in a syringe in a nurse's locker at the University Hospital of Ulm. Now the nurse has been arrested and accused of poisoning the five infants with morphine, the New York Times reports. The babies—all premature, up to a month old—were taken to intensive care in December when their breathing became troubled and eventually stopped. They were saved at ICU, but what caused the problem? Doctors guessed an infection, but urine tests found morphine in all five of them, though only three had been prescribed the drug. That's the twist: Morphine is prescribed to help newborns of drug-addicted moms, but leads to breathing problems. In this case, the fact that all five had respiratory issues at the same time in the same ward, and only three had morphine prescriptions, rang enough alarm bells to bring in the police on January 17. Now the nurse will likely face five charges of attempted manslaughter and grievous bodily harm, but she denies everything, per the Guardian. Authorities say she has no known motive and is being psychologically evaluated.  It is only thanks to the quick and immediate actions of the hospital staff the lives of the five infants could be saved,  said the health of Ulm police.

Or rather their parents can, because the backpack insert at the nondenominational Florida Christian School costs $120, reports the Miami Herald. That's because it's bulletproof, the newest security measure taken by the school after 2012's Sandy Hook massacre.  I'd rather be prepared for the worst than be stuck after saying, 'Wow, I wish we would've done that,'  says George Gulla, the school's security chief. Since Gulla came on board, the school, which has students from preschool age through high school seniors, has also put in place security cameras, easily identifiable security guards, and even shooter drills where students are taught to hold their backpacks in front of their bodies to  protect [their] center mass,  Gulla explains. Enter parent Alex Cejas, who is offering thin, soft-armor backpack inserts made by his company, Applied Fiber Concepts. No thicker than a binder, the insert is meant to stop bullets from smaller pistols and revolvers (though not more powerful weapons) and offer  peace of mind,  says Cejas. The Washington Post cites products geared toward schools that have emerged since Sandy Hook, with manufacturers producing everything from bulletproof backpacks and binder inserts to writing tablets that can double as shields. But a security expert tells the Herald in the schools he's studied, it's a breakdown in the school's procedures or human error that usually causes or worsens incidents, not a lack of high-tech security gear.

The dominant pattern of sleep, arguably since time immemorial, was biphasic,  a sleep historian tells Life’s Little Mysteries. What that means: Sleep came in two four-hour blocks, with a period of an hour or more in between during which people might pray, think about their dreams, or even visit with neighbors. But that was back when darkness could last as long as 14 hours a night with nothing but candles for extra light, meaning people were more prone to go to bed early—and thus have more flexibility with their nightly schedule. Thanks to the invention of the lightbulb, we now stay awake later, leaving us with less sleep time—meaning that in order to get the same amount of sleep, we have to do it all at once. But when subjected to natural light patterns, one study found everyone still sleeps biphasically, and concluded that such a sleep pattern is actually beneficial.",You Don't Need 8 Hours of Sleep ... in a Row,You Don't Need ____ Hours of Sleep ... in a Row,8,Trans( eight ),1

Kim Jong Nam was preparing to return to his home in Macau from a week in Malaysia when he encountered two attractive women in the airport's busy Terminal 2, the Washington Post reports, citing interviews with airport staff and police. One woman grabbed Kim while the other sprayed liquid on his face and held a cloth on it for around 10 seconds. The pair then made a leisurely getaway, strolling through the terminal and waiting in line for a taxi, while their victim staggered to a counter seeking help before dying in an ambulance. The fast-acting poison the women apparently used is typical of North Korean assassination attempts, according to the Post. Results from an autopsy, which North Korean diplomats reportedly tried to prevent, have not been made public. The BBC reports that two women have been arrested in connection with the case: A woman traveling on a Vietnamese passport who was arrested Wednesday, and a suspect with an Indonesian passport arrested Thursday.

"(Nov 14, 2017  4:21 PM) Is a 13-year-old girl old enough to agree to sex with an adult? That's a question France is asking itself as the government prepares to set a legal age for sexual consent for the first time, the AP reports. Twice in recent weeks, French courts refused to prosecute grown men for rape after they had sex with 11-year-olds because authorities couldn't prove coercion. Amid public horror, the government is drafting a bill to say sex with children under a certain age is by definition coercive. Feminist groups plan a protest Tuesday to argue the age should be set at 15. Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet says 13  is worth considering.  The age is just one piece of an upcoming bill on sexual violence and harassment. As France24 explains, it is illegal in France to have sex with someone younger than 15, but it's only considered sexual abuse. Prosecutors must be able to prove a lack of consent in order for it to be considered rape—because there is no minimum age under which, by law, a child is considered to be legally unable to give consent. One of the men referenced above, for example, was tried for sexual abuse instead of rape due to France's current legal definition of rape, PBS NewsHour reports.  The law will mean that 'below a certain age, there can be no debate, ever, on the sexual consent of a child, and that any child below a certain age would automatically be considered as raped or sexually assaulted,'  the country's equalities minister explains, per the Local.","After Shocking Cases Involving 11-Year-Olds, France to Set Age of Consent","After Shocking Cases Involving ____-Year-Olds, France to Set Age of Consent",11,Copy( 11 ),0

His attorney says Donovan scored in the top 1% of applicants, passed the physical exam, and flew to New York twice for the recruitment process; he is currently still serving on active duty, but wanted to move to New York when he's eligible to retire from the Navy next year, CNN reports.

"(Jul 7, 2017  3:12 AM CDT) Professional runner Moninda Marube came in second in a race Tuesday but came in first in a more important one Wednesday when he encountered two black bears. Marube says he met the bears early in the morning on a dirt road in woods near Auburn, Maine, the Guardian reports. He says he can't swim, and knows better than to try to climb a tree to escape a bear, so he decided running was his only option when they charged. Marube says he managed to make it to a vacant house he had passed earlier. He got to the porch and closed the screen door with the bears just 10 yards behind him. Over the next few minutes, the two bears sniffed around the porch and looked through the screening before wandering off. Marube tells the Lewiston Sun Journal that he encountered a leopard once while running in Kenya, where he grew up, but the close call with the bears was much worse.  I don't fear lion,  he says.  I don't fear anything else. But a bear is scary.  Marube says he plans to start his runs later in the morning and will carry pepper spray in the future. Authorities in Maine say people who encounter aggressive bears are not advised to run. Instead, they should try to make themselves look larger while slowly backing away—and  remain calm  if they charge. Marube says he was aware of advice to  stand your ground —but found it hard to follow it when the bears ran at him.

"(Nov 2, 2017  2:04 PM CDT) To say that it was an indulgent purchase would be an understatement: A Chinese millionaire paid a record $10,050 for a shot of 1878 Macallan single malt scotch in July—except it turns out the alcohol was all of 40 years old. Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman,  The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.  The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002.

Police initially said two officers were wounded Sunday as they tried to serve a search warrant following a kidnapping attempt in Chickasha, about 40 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, the AP reports. Chickasha Police Chief Goebel Music said Tuesday that seven officers were injured after the suspect allegedly opened fire from a home. Music says two officers were taken to a hospital. One was treated for shrapnel wounds and released. The other was repeatedly shot in the arm and remains hospitalized. Music says the five other officers were treated at the scene for lesser injuries.

We've had a lot of fake news where they're saying, ‘Oh there’s no unity, there’s no unity.’ There’s total unity,  Trump said Monday, speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He said there had been  a lot of progress made on Iran  and  the biggest part of the conclusion, they can’t have nuclear weapons,  the Washington Post reports.

The world's ninth-highest-paid actor, who has appeared in more than 100 Bollywood films, was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday in India after being found guilty of poaching, though his lawyers intend to appeal and a bail hearing is slated for tomorrow. Khan was initially convicted of killing two blackbucks, a protected species of antelope, in 2006, some eight years after prosecutors said he shot the animals from a car while in Jodhpur to film 1998's Hum Saath Saath Hain, reports the Guardian. The car's registration number was reportedly seen by a member of the Bishnoi tribe, which views the antelope as sacred. But Khan's conviction was later suspended, per the BBC. He was then acquitted before charges were laid again. Khan was taken to jail following Thursday's verdict; four other actors in the car were acquitted for lack of evidence. The prosecution  engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence and documents as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case,  Khan's lawyer, HM Saraswat, tells Gulf News.  It even failed to prove that the black bucks were killed by gunshots.  His lawyers said Khan had only an air gun that couldn't have taken down an antelope, per CNN; Khan has suggested the animals died from overeating. Khan has other legal troubles to worry about: His 2015 acquittal in the 2002 hit-and-run death of a homeless man is being challenged in the Supreme Court, per the Guardian.

French prosecutors said a terrorism investigation was opened, though authorities did not announce a motive for the bloodshed. The city is home to the European Parliament, which was locked down after the shooting. It was unclear if the market—which was the nucleus of an al-Qaeda-linked plot in 2000—was targeted. The prefect of the Strasbourg region said the suspect was previously flagged as a possible extremist. The gunman has been identified and has a criminal record, according to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner; one official says he was wounded by soldiers guarding the market. Gendarmes went to the suspect's home to arrest him earlier Tuesday, before the attack, but he wasn't there, Morisse said. They found explosive materials, he said. French military spokesman Col. Patrik Steiger said the shooter did not aim for the soldiers patrolling in and around the Christmas market, but targeted civilians instead. Several of the people wounded were in critical condition, the interior minister said.

Jake Strotman was coming from dollar-beer night at a local hockey game on Jan. 23 when he found himself in the middle of a brawl between Baptist street preachers and a man angry at their proselytizing. Strotman says he didn't mean to get into the fight, and he definitely didn't mean to strike one of the preachers in the face. Strotman was facing 90 days in jail when Judge William Mallory asked if anyone had any alternative ideas for a punishment. Strotman had an idea.  Your honor, if I may, I would be more than happy to serve a church of your choosing.  So instead of jail, Strotman will spend 90 minutes of his next 12 Sundays attending services at the victim's Baptist church.  Three months, that's not that bad,'' Strotman, a Catholic, says.

American Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan, a Swede, went missing March 12 while in the central Kasai province, where they were gathering information on a rebel uprising against the government that the New York Times describes as  relatively new  and  poorly understood.  The BBC received confirmation from a Congolese government rep that Catalan had been beheaded; Sharp had not. The body of their Congolese interpreter was also found, but three drivers who accompanied them remain missing. The rep cites a witness who says the group was ambushed and abducted. The UN is calling on the country to investigate. Human Rights Watch explains the Group of Experts play a role in the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Democratic Republic of Congo, and make recommendations as to which individuals and groups should be added to the list. In pursuit of that, they gather intel on everything from human rights violations to gunrunning. Per HRW,  Their reports are among the most comprehensive and reliable sources of information about conflict dynamics in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  The Times describes Sharp, 34, as incredibly well networked with the rebel leaders.  Rebels go to church. You build a relationship with them there,  he had reportedly said. HRW notes this marks the first such crime against international workers in the Kasai region, which has until lately enjoyed peace in contrast with the country's tumultuous east.",2 UN Experts Who Vanished in Congo Found in Grave,____ UN Experts Who Vanished in Congo Found in Grave,2,Trans( two ),1

Genesis Davila was named Miss Florida USA 2017 on July 16. Her reign lasted all of six days. Pageant executive director Grant Gravitt tells the Miami Herald he stripped Davila of her title after receiving  30 to 40 complaints  from other contestants. At issue is Davila possibly using her own professional hair and makeup team instead of the one provided by the pageant. Gravitt claims to have photographic proof of Davila breaking the rules. By losing her crown, Davila also loses the chance to compete in the Miss USA 2017 pageant and at least $100,000 in  endorsements and appearances.  Now she's suing Gravitt and the other organizers of Miss Florida 2017 for defamation. Her lawyer says that Gravitt's photographic evidence comes from a week before the pageant and that he  acted maliciously and intentionally to defame and hurt my client.  Davila, who is from Puerto Rico, also claims Gravitt accused her of not being a US citizen, the Sun-Sentinel reports.  I am innocent,  People quotes Davila as saying.

Which is why this Facebook post from his wife, spotted by an editor at National Journal, doesn't bode well:  Does anybody from my Husband's staff remember his FB page access?  Yes, it's authentic, reports Bloomberg. Stephanie Chafee is looking for anyone who recalls how to log in to the page Chafee used as governor, so it can be merged with his 2016 presidential page. It seems the former is getting more traffic. Once the campaign gets past that hurdle, Chafee will have to work on name recognition. NPR helps with a primer on his political career, observing that  it is not often that a person can be said to have personally ended an era, but Chafee may well be remembered as the last liberal Republican to serve in the U.S. Senate.  Chafee was originally a Republican before becoming an independent and, finally, a Democrat. Even while with the GOP, however, he consistently ranked less conservative than even some Democrats, thanks to his support of gay marriage, abortion rights, a higher minimum wage, and more taxes on the rich.

The report probably won’t have much impact on our lending capabilities, but it’s a sign of just how contentious the G20 meeting in Seoul promises to be, the New York Times reports. Many nations are irked over the Federal Reserve's decision to pump yet more money into the economy. Germany has protested especially loudly, accusing the US of Chinese-style currency manipulation. Obama has sent a letter to G20 leaders defending the move, and calling for unity. But there's little chance of that; a debate last night on currency imbalances got so heated  we had to physically open the door,  a South Korean spokesman told the Wall Street Journal.

Authorities near Chicago say 92-year-old Aloysius Mack lost much of his life savings to a woman who first approached him at a McDonald's and eventually tricked him into marrying her, reports CBS Chicago. When all was said and done, the woman had convinced Mack to buy her a $40,000 van and an $80,000 now-shuttered laundromat, and he changed his will so she'd inherit his $260,000 home.  I think she was stalking me,  says Mack, who has been diagnosed with dementia. In another case reported by the Cook County public guardian, a 79-year-old woman with severe dementia married her caretaker and  spent, wired, mailed or gifted  more than $65,000 to him. Financials cons that target the elderly are so common that Barron's calls it a  silent epidemic,  and it may only get worse as baby boomers age. In San Diego, officials have been on the hunt for three men scamming elderly Spanish speakers—a 73-year-old woman was lured into helping them collect lottery money and ultimately threatened before she withdrew $1,800 from her bank account, reports the San Diego Tribune.

The drink was outlawed in Iceland for 74 years, while all other booze was completely legal. The alcoholic anomaly finally ended on March 1, 1989. The beer ban was a leftover from the country's prohibition era, which started in 1915 when the population voted in a referendum to outlaw all alcoholic drinks, the AP reports.

So locals were baffled when the two French men were found dead over a backyard garden dinner at Perot's home last Thursday, 69-year-old Perot sitting at the table in front of a half-eaten plate of food and 38-year-old Boudin on his back on the ground. A neighbor initially thought they were sleeping off some booze, but when they were in the same positions later, she checked on them and found they were dead. Now, autopsies on the men have solved the mystery of what happened—and led locals to bemoan the  stupid  deaths, the Guardian reports. There were no signs of foul play or a break-in, and though officials initially suspected a sudden case of botulism from canned beans the men were eating, tests on the food came back normal. Officials even wondered whether the friends had a suicide pact, the BBC reported at the time. On Wednesday, officials announced that postmortem examinations found Perot, who had several missing teeth, didn't properly chew the last bite of food he took, a 1.5-ounce piece of beef rib. He choked to death on it, and Boudin, who had a genetic heart condition, apparently had a fatal heart attack upon watching the scene unfold.

"(Dec 21, 2017  1:30 PM) American taxpayers spend millions of dollars a year on bus tickets out of town for homeless people. New York City alone budgets about $500,000 annually for its homeless relocation program, which can also include expensive plane tickets to places like Nigeria, France, and New Zealand. But despite the money being spent on busing homeless people somewhere else, there's never been a large-scale study on the effectiveness—for cities or homeless people themselves—of such programs. In an eyeopening piece, the Guardian spent 18 months investigating relocation programs, identifying more than 34,000 trips taken by homeless people out of 16 cities and counties—in the western US, Florida, and New York—that have such programs. The results show the outcomes of busing homeless people out of town are all over the map. A 22-year-old woman was homeless and struggling with alcoholism when she was bused out of Fort Lauderdale and returned to her mother; she credits it with saving her life. But a 49-year-old woman also shipped out of Fort Lauderdale to New York faced nights in a McDonald's, abuse, and a return to the Florida city she left. Homeless people report feeling forced to accept bus tickets, and a man given a ticket out of Key West says he felt the program  stabbed me in the back.  Relocation programs say they can give homeless people a chance to return to old support networks in their hometowns and get a new start, but cities aren't necessarily acting purely out of good intentions. For example, bus tickets are cheap compared to the estimated $80,000 each chronically homeless person costs San Francisco on a yearly basis.

More than 650 pilot whales had beached themselves along Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island in two separate mass strandings over recent days. About 350 whales have died, including 20 that were euthanized. Another 100 have been refloated by volunteers and more than 200 have swum away unassisted. Hundreds of volunteers from farmers to tourists have spent days at the beach dousing the whales with buckets of water to keep them cool and trying to refloat them.  People seem to have an emotional attachment to marine mammals,  said Department of Conservation spokesman Herb Christophers.  They've been singing songs to them, giving them specific names, treating them as kindred spirits.  Christophers said everyone is hoping the strandings are finally over. The first group of more than 400 beached whales was found early Friday, with many already dead.  You could hear the sounds of splashing, of blowholes being cleared, of sighing,  said Cheree Morrison, who first stumbled upon the whales.  The young ones were the worst. Crying is the only way to describe it.  Volunteers managed to refloat the surviving whales on Saturday, only to hear of a second mass stranding hours later. In recent days, volunteers formed human chains in the water to stop the creatures from beaching again, despite being warned that one whale had marks that looked like a shark bite. Officials will soon need to turn to the grim task of disposing of hundreds of carcasses.

The corellas  were literally falling out of the trees in front of [one rescuer], falling out of the sky,  the founder of Casper's Bird Rescue tells the Guardian.  Only two or three were actually deceased. The rest were just screaming on the ground. They couldn’t fly any more, they were bleeding out of their mouths.

One species of corella, the little corella, is considered a pest in South Australia and is listed as unprotected by the state government; in March, one local council actually proposed culling the population via gassing. The Alexandrina council explained that the birds can damage infrastructure and vegetation and displace other native species. But the rescue founder says 57 of the birds killed were long-billed corellas, a protected species. She says some sort of slow-acting poison was likely used, calling it a  horrific  way to die:  It's not an instant death. It causes suffering. It takes a few weeks for it to work.

"(Aug 10, 2008  3:38 PM CDT) Author Susan Squire takes a long view of marriage—about 5,000 years, in fact. Her new book, I Don’t: A Contrarian History of Marriage, traces matrimony’s bizarre historical journey, from pure mating ritual to Christian  lust-containment facility  to modern romance. In an interview with Salon, she says that love had nothing to do with marriage until Martin Luther said it did. In early Christianity, loving one’s wife—or any woman—was  heresy to the church,  Squire says. But codes of conduct for adultery—aka courtly love—elevated commitment to a love object, and in the 16th century, Luther called marriage a holy state of being. Modern husbands and wives may rely overly on romance and sex, but can also be credited with a new marital notion: equality.  We have tried to invert roles that have been set in stone for 4,700 years,  says Squire.  It's going to take a while.","How 5,000 Years of Marriage Led Us to 'I Do'",How ____ Years of Marriage Led Us to 'I Do',"5,000","Copy( 5,000 )",0

"(May 17, 2012  7:44 AM CDT) Europe has hundreds of billions of reasons to try to keep Greece from unceremoniously ditching the eurozone. If Greece leaves, the rest of Europe would face catastrophic losses, Reuters reports. Greece would default on the roughly $250 billion in debt held by the ECB, IMF, and other eurozone nations, and that loss will likely be  high enough to eliminate the ECB's capital,  one investor said. And the losses wouldn't end there because Europe would still probably have to prevent a total collapse or risk economic contagion. How bad could it get? One Guardian estimate puts the total cost at $1 trillion. But it's looking increasingly unlikely Greece will abide by its bailout deal; new elections are looming, and polls favor Alexis Tsipras' far-left party. In a BBC interview, Tsipras urged Europe, and particularly Angela Merkel, to  stop playing poker with the lives of people  by demanding such harsh austerity measures. That defiance has some European decision-makers pushing to rip the Band-Aid off and boot Greece.  It's going to hurt, absolutely,  one diplomat tells Reuters.

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch held up an EpiPen as she told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that she wishes the company had  better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration  of the rising prices for some families.  We never intended this,  she said, but maintained that her company doesn't make much profit from each emergency allergy shot. The list price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500% since 2007. Republicans and Democrats have said families struggling to pay for the shots have every right to be angry at Mylan. Opening the hearing, House Oversight Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said high executive pay at Mylan  doesn't add up for a lot of people  as the EpiPen price has increased. Chaffetz said executives for the company made $300 million over five years while the list price for a pair of the emergency allergy shots rose.  Parents don't have a choice,  Chaffetz said.  If your loved one needs this, it better darn well be in your backpack.  Bresch said the company makes only $50 in profit on each EpiPen. But Chaffetz said he finds that  a little hard to believe.  Mylan says it has made strides to more widely distribute EpiPens to schools and others and raised awareness of deadly allergies. That requires investment, Bresch said.

The cops say the car that plowed into crowds and burst into flames, killing five, contained gasoline, knives, and a jihadist flag, reports Reuters. The man identified by police as the driver, Usmen Hasan, had a Uighur name, and was joined in the vehicle by his wife and mother, the AP reports. The five arrested in relation to the attacks also have names that suggest they are Uighurs.  The initial understanding of the police is that the Oct. 28 incident is a case of a violent terrorist attack that was carefully planned, organized, and plotted,  police said in a statement. The statement said the five detained had helped plan and execute the attack, and were caught 10 hours after it was carried out. It said they had been on the run and were tracked down with the help of police in Xinjiang and elsewhere. It didn't say where they were captured, but said police had found jihadi flags and long knives inside their temporary lodgings.

"(Dec 29, 2016  3:41 PM) What if detecting cancer was as easy as breathing in and out? According to a study published last week in American Chemical Society Nano, it pretty much is. Scientist Hossam Haick has been working on his  electronic nose  for years, the Outline reports, and this new study shows the impressive things it can do. According to Smithsonian Magazine, scientists used the device to sample the breaths of more than 1,400 people and found it could diagnose 17 different diseases—Parkinson's, lung cancer, kidney failure, MS, Crohn's disease, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer, just to name a few—with 86% accuracy. Haick's device works by using artificially intelligent nanoarrays to  smell  a person's breath and identify volatile organic compounds at a molecular level. Thirteen of these compounds, in various amounts and combinations, create a unique  breathprint  for diseases. The 86% success rate is still too low for what Haick calls the Na-Nose to be used in the real world, Engadget reports. But scientists believe in a number of years it could be cheap and easy enough for people to use at home. Because of that, people who aren't even showing symptoms could be screened, leading to very early detection and more successful treatment. For example, Haick says the Na-Nose could be used to increase lung cancer survival rates from 10% to 70% just through early diagnosis.

Only part of that total is in straight-up medical bills, reports the Los Angeles Times. The study in JAMA Pediatrics also factored in the costs of buying special food, placing the child in schools or camps willing to accommodate their needs, and even sacrificing or at least compromising careers for the sake of the child. Parents  often need to be at school, social events, or camp to educate and affirm the seriousness of their child’s condition,  the researchers explain. It all adds up:  Kids with food allergies don't tend to have long hospital stays, but your expenses come in other ways,  says the lead author from Northwestern, reports USA Today.

And since 2000, the comic's official website had remained exactly the same—until Friday. Not only did the site get an update, it got an update that appears to tease the comic's return, ComicBook.com reports.  Uncommon, unreal, and (soon-to-be) unfrozen,  reads the tagline under a picture of animals and people from the comic being freed from a block of ice with a blow torch.  A new online era of The Far Side is coming!  it adds. (Andy Baio has a screenshot of the old website here.) Larson's single-panel comic ran from 1980 to 1995, and spawned a multitude of merchandise and related media, from greeting cards and page-a-day calendars to TV specials, the last of which ran in 1997. The New York Times estimates it generated around $500 million in revenue. Nerdist notes the artwork on the website is signed by Larson, but the site offers no further explanation, so it's not clear whether Larson plans to produce new comics, to simply publish his old comics online (the AV Club notes Larson  has previously pushed back against any digital reproductions of his work ), or something else entirely. Nerdist guesses that whatever is happening will occur on January 1, 2020, exactly 25 years after the final comic was published and exactly 40 years after the first comic debuted on January 1, 1980.

He was also nominated for a Golden Globe as the harried police lieutenant in 1975's Dog Day Afternoon. The younger Durning barely survived World War II. He was among the first wave of US soldiers to land at Normandy during the D-Day invasion and the only member of his Army unit to survive. He killed several Germans and was wounded in the leg. Later he was bayoneted by a young German soldier whom he killed with a rock. He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and survived a massacre of prisoners. In later years, he refused to discuss the military service for which he was awarded the Silver Star and three Purple Hearts.  Too many bad memories,  he said in 1997.  I don't want you to see me crying.  Fellow actor Jack Klugman also died yesterday.",Character Actor Charles Durning Dead at 89,Character Actor Charles Durning Dead at ____,89,Copy( 89 ),0
"(Nov 22, 2015  7:00 PM) Belgian prosecutors announced early Monday that police had detained 16 people in 22 raids but that Paris fugitive Salah Abdeslam was not among them. Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said no firearms or explosives were discovered in the raids—19 in Brussels and three in Charleroi in the country's south. One of those detained was injured when a car he was in tried to ram police during an attempted getaway.  The investigation continues,  says Van Der Sypt. The raids capped a tense day with hundreds of troops patrolling and authorities hunting for one or more suspected militants. The Belgian government chose Sunday to keep the capital on the highest state of alert into the start of the workweek to prevent a Paris-style attack. Citing a  serious and imminent  threat, Prime Minister Charles Michel announced that schools and universities in Brussels will be closed Monday, along with the subway, preventing a return to normal in the city that is also home to the European Union's main institutions.  We fear an attack like in Paris, with several individuals, perhaps in several places,  Michel said after chairing a meeting of Belgium's National Security Council. While Brussels was kept on the highest of four alert levels, the rest of the country remains on a Level 3 alert, meaning an attack is  possible and likely.  Says Michel:  Nobody is pleased with such a situation. Neither are we. But we have to take our responsibility.","Belgium Police Arrest 16, But Not Paris Fugitive","Belgium Police Arrest ____, But Not Paris Fugitive",16,Copy( 16 ),0

We've got to have security,  Panetta tells ABC News.  Unfortunately, there are a few companies that provide that kind of security. The State Department relies on them, we rely on them.  The firm is now known as Xe Services instead of Blackwater, but its notorious reputation still sticks to it  like crude oil on a Gulf bird,  notes correspondent Jake Tapper. Blackwater guards have been linked to a number of troubling shootings, including the killing of 17 apparently unarmed civilians in a Baghdad intersection in 2007. The contract has infuriated members of Congress.  I’m mystified why any branch of the government would hire Blackwater,  said Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky.  We’re talking about murder. It's a company with a horrible reputation that jeopardizes our mission in so many different ways.  Xe's bid to provide security at US consulates in the cities of Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif was $26 million less than the next closest bid, Panetta emphasized.",CIA Boss Defends $100M Blackwater Contract,CIA Boss Defends $____M Blackwater Contract,100,Copy( 100 ),0
"(Oct 14, 2015  5:46 PM CDT) Three young sisters died Tuesday in a freak accident on a family farm in rural Canada, the Edmonton Journal reports. The girls—11-year-old twins Dara and Jana and 13-year-old Catie—were smothered by canola seed in the back of a truck, though the details of their deaths remain hazy. A deputy fire chief tells CBC News the girls somehow fell into the canola seed while the truck was being unloaded. But the Journal reports the girls were playing on the truck while it was being filled with seed and were buried. Regardless, family members and neighbors pulled the girls out and attempted CPR without success, according to the Calgary Sun.  Our kids died living life on the farm,  the Alberta family says in a statement.  We do not regret raising and involving our kids … on our farm. It was our life.  The family's pastor spoke on behalf of the family, telling the Journal:  They are obviously devastated. There is just a deep sense of loss and sadness.  Neighbors were planning to finish the grieving family's autumn harvest for them, and nine combines and several trucks were already on the job Wednesday. One man sent up a drone to take a photo of the group effort.  I want Roger to see this,  he said, referring to the girls' father.  I want him to know how everyone is here to help him.

"(Jul 29, 2020  2:24 PM CDT) It's a good time to be living alone on  one of the most beautiful islands in the entire Mediterranean.  But the quiet paradise Mauro Morandi has enjoyed for 30 years on the Isle of Budelli off the coast of Sardinia will soon be taken from him, reports CNN. Italian authorities plan to refashion the former World War II radio station Morandi occupies into an environmental observatory, meaning the 81-year-old caretaker must clear out. But Morandi is digging in his feet. He says Budelli has been his only home since he arrived by chance while trying to sail to Polynesia in 1989, as the Atlantic reported in 2016. The former teacher fell in love with the one-mile-long parcel of pink sand and took over for the previous caretaker.  I'm ready to do all I can to stay here,  he tells CNN.  I wouldn't know where else to go.  The island has changed ownership numerous times in recent years. Since 2015, it's been owned by the La Maddalena National Park, whose president considers Morandi to be an  illegal occupant  and points out the structure he lives in has been modified in ways that aren't exactly legal either.  Nobody wants to chase him away, but what title does he have to stay since the island is no longer private?  Fabrizio Fonnesu tells CNN. The eviction battle has been ongoing for years, but construction work is now just months away, and Morandi needs to go when it starts, says Fonnesu. Morandi, backed by thousands of supporters, has a request: that authorities agree he can return as caretaker. Otherwise,  they'll have to drag me away.  Fonnesu is making no such promises but says that if a caretaker position opens post-renovation, Morandi could be considered for it—though he points out it would be a highly desirable job.","After 30 Years Alone on an Island, He's Told to Clear Out","After ____ Years Alone on an Island, He's Told to Clear Out",30,Copy( 30 ),0
"(Jan 29, 2015  8:43 AM) Gunman Man Haron Monis killed one of the two Sydney siege victims execution-style; the other was the victim of ricocheting bullets fired by police who stormed the cafe after witnessing Tori Johnson's murder. The details came at the opening day of the inquest into last month's siege at the Lindt cafe, reports Australia's ABC News. Monis reportedly forced Johnson to kneel, and  after a short lapse of time Mr Monis simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of the head,  per a lawyer assisting the coroner. A police marksman witnessed the shot, which Jeremy Gormly says likely killed Johnson instantly, and  called it in. That resulted in an immediate order to force entry of the cafe.  Katrina Dawson was killed as police moved in, by fragments from a police bullet or bullets that ricocheted off of other surfaces. The New York Times reports that one of the six fragments pierced a major blood vessel; the 38-year-old lost consciousness soon after, per Gormly. Though Monis fired off three shots as police moved in, none struck a person. At least 13 bullets or bullet fragments hit Monis. Though the forensics of Dawson's death had been aired, the Times notes this is the first official statement on whose bullets killed the victims. ABC News reports that there has been some public criticism about the rifle (M4A1 carbine) used by police, with a former member of the country's military counter-terrorism unit describing the heavy bullets as overly likely to ricochet.",How the 2 Sydney Siege Victims Died,How the ____ Sydney Siege Victims Died,2,Trans( two ),1

Surviving comrades of that horrid day presented me a bracelet fashioned from the leather laces of Herman’s boots,  Rivera writes of what followed.  I have worn it every day since, without fail.  But in reality, Johnson was airlifted out in a body bag, woke up in a  make-shift morgue  with a toe tag, recovered, and never saw Rivera again, believing him to also be dead. Nearly five decades later, an Iraq veteran went to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall to take a rubbing of Johnson's name so Rivera could hang it on his wall, next to Johnson's picture—only to discover Johnson's name wasn't there. With the help of other veterans, Johnson was found, alive and living in Michigan, Courthouse News Service reports. But the good news wasn't over yet: Rivera, who wrote about the experience of having his best friend die in his arms in his novel, Raw Man, was dismayed to discover Johnson hadn't gotten a Purple Heart, the award given to those wounded or killed in service. He started a campaign to get him one—and was met with much resistance along the way, per CNS. His request was denied multiple times due to a lack of paperwork, even though Rivera went to much trouble to track down all the evidence he could. Finally, Rivera got a retired three-star general to advocate for Johnson, and the Army approved the Purple Heart request.

They should be allowed just to go across the street to the store ... without stuff like this happening,  his mother, Krystal Falkner, tells the Chicago Tribune. The family lives in an apartment building across the street from the store in the city's Old Town neighborhood. The boys ran inside the apartment complex after the shooting; Adrian later told his parents he didn't realize he'd been shot until he got back to the complex, father Curtis Clayton says. Both children, and an older man who was also shot in the incident, are in stable condition at local hospitals. Adrian's parents say there aren't enough programs in the neighborhoods to keep kids off the streets, and that's what they blame for the gang activity in the neighborhood.  When it all boils down, the city ain't ever got no money when it come down to the youth, and that’s messed up,  Curtis Clayton says. Something got to give in Chicago. Something have to give.

Investigators say the 46-year-old could afford to be generous: He was allegedly involved in a conspiracy to import heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl from Mexico, the State reports. The numerous charges against McGowan and nine other suspects include conspiracy to import controlled substances and conspiracy to commit bulk cash smuggling. Authorities say he has been arrested at least six times before and recently served two years in federal prison for cocaine possession. McGowan gained viral attention after he bought every box of cookies Greenville's Troop 1574 had Friday. Agents say McGowan had been under surveillance for months and the arrest Tuesday was  completely unrelated  to the cookie purchase. He  used his story of buying $540 of Girl Scout cookies to falsely shine the spotlight on himself under the pretense of being a pillar of the community; in reality, he is a pariah to the community,  says Robert J.

"(Jul 29, 2013  6:09 AM CDT) Politico is calling it a  major shakeup,  while the New York Daily News paints it as a  seemingly inevitable divorce.  America's No. 2 radio broadcaster intends to give Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity the boot by year-end, per an industry source. Money is apparently the root of this problem: Cumulus Media's move is said to be the result of an impasse it reached with Premiere Networks over the cost of distribution rights, with the latter refusing to drop that cost to a number Cumulus is happy with; Premiere is the Clear Channel arm that syndicates Limbaugh and Hannity's shows. What does that mean for Limbaugh and Hannity, who have the No. 1 and No. 2 radio talk shows in America by a landslide? Not much, maybe. They'd be wiped from more than 40 major-market Cumulus channels, but they'd likely shift to Clear Channel stations in those markets. And, writing for The Week, Peter Weber thinks Limbaugh and Hannity  have the upper hand,  because if they do move to Clear Channel, it can't really pay them anything less than it was demanding of Cumulus. Politico points out that Limbaugh was rumored to have soured on Cumulus following a March earnings call in which CEO Lew Dickey said the company was still losing money because of Limbaugh's  slut  comments.

"(Mar 19, 2018  7:11 AM CDT) If we're going by the numbers, the latest one emerging from the CDC is a big one: 17.5 billion, signifying the number of binge drinks quaffed annually by US adults during such binges, per Live Science. That figure, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, comes from the 37 million adults—about 17% of the total adult population—who copped to binge drinking, which equates to four drinks in one sitting for women, five for men. That ends up being 470 binge drinks or so per binge drinker each year, with a binge-drinking episode taking place on average once a week and the number of drinks consumed per episode coming in at an average of seven.  This study shows that binge drinkers are consuming a huge number of drinks per year, greatly increasing their chances of harming themselves and others,  study lead author Robert Brewer says in an accompanying release. Researchers arrived at these numbers via monthly interviews in 2015 with more than 400,000 US adults about their binge-drinking habits; those numbers were then extrapolated to come up with annual figures. Men were responsible for downing about 80% of the binge drinks, and the habit was most prevalent among adults ages 18 to 34. However, more than half of all binge drinks consumed were tied back to adults ages 35 and older. The four states with the most binge-drinking: Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Hawaii. To reduce binge drinking—which can lead to DUIs, violent behavior, heart disease, liver issues, and cancer—researchers endorse a  comprehensive approach  that includes intervention by health care professionals and limiting the availability of alcoholic beverages within communities.

A study in PLoS ONE suggests the creatures can detect rainstorms happening 150 miles away, possibly by hearing them even from that far off. Migrating elephants are known to change direction out of the blue, and researchers haven't been certain why. The Namibian research team figured it might be because of rain—as Phys.org explains, elephants are regularly looking for water in the region, which is dry outside of the January-to-March rainy season. Researchers placed GPS devices on elephants in 14 different herds for seven years. Meanwhile, they kept track of rainfall in the region. They found that changes in the elephants' movements were associated with the direction of rain.  We don’t know if they can actually hear the thunder or if they are detecting other low-frequency sounds generated by the storms that humans can’t hear,  a researcher says, as the tamuTimes reports.  But there is no doubt they know what direction the rain is.

"(Mar 27, 2015  9:14 AM CDT) One small slide for Diet Coke, one giant leap for Pepsi? While Coke has retained its crown, Pepsi has replaced Diet Coke as the second-most consumed soda in the US by volume. According to 2014 industry data via Beverage Digest, both actually saw volume fall, but Pepsi's 1.8% dip was smaller than Diet Coke's 6.6% drop, resulting in the slightest market-share edge for Pepsi, at 8.8% to 8.5%. Diet soda in general is taking a beating, the Wall Street Journal reports: Coke Zero's volume dropped 2%, Diet Pepsi fell 5.2%, and Diet Mountain Dew slid 3%. Fortune frames their predicament thusly: Health-conscious consumers are favoring juices and flavored waters that are free of ingredients like aspartame, a sugar substitute that a September 2014 study found may actually raise your blood sugar. To wit, the Washington Post reports that in the last decade, Diet Coke's sales have sunk by nearly 30%; Diet Pepsi has fared worse. And while volumes of all nonalcoholic drink were up 1.7%, soda consumption as a whole fell for the 10th consecutive year, with a 0.9% drop in volume last year. That category includes bottled water, which Beverage Marketing Corp. says took a big jump in volume last year: up 7.3%. That bolsters the industry tracker's prediction that by as soon as late next year, bottled water volumes could overtake soda volumes.

On Wednesday, Republicans retaliated in the simplest of ways: They changed those rules. As a result, the names of Treasury nominee Steve Mnuchin and Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price have advanced to the Senate floor for final confirmation, reports the Hill. The procedural maneuvering began Tuesday, when every Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted scheduled votes on the pair, saying neither had properly answered background questions. That effectively stopped the process because committee rules say at least one member from each party must be present for a vote to take place. On Wednesday, Democrats boycotted again, so Republicans on the panel agreed to ditch the one-member-present rule. Voila: Both nominees advanced by votes of 14-0.

The men in the Jeep yelled racial epithets at Reat and the others, and one brandished a gun. They also threw bottles and bottle rockets hard enough to break the car's window, according to Courthouse News Service. Reat and the others made it back to Wheat Ridge and called 911. Dispatcher Juan Rodriguez, who has since been fired, told them— for reasons that remain unclear,  per the court ruling—that they'd have to return to the scene of the crime if they wanted help.  I said, 'I'm here at home, this is where I feel safe so please send somebody,' Pal tells the Denver Channel.  He said, 'No. If you don't go back that way, we won't be able to send anybody, and it's going to be your loss.

Police believe Farris ended up in the lake after losing control of her vehicle or swerving to avoid an animal. She was last seen at a gas station in Salmon Arm, more than 60 miles west of Revelstoke. After she vanished, relatives and police scoured the highway but found no trace of her.  I think the worst thing was not knowing,  says her son, 62-year-old George Farris.  Given a sad situation, it's the best of all outcomes.  He says the family now has closure,  the end of the story,  and they plan to bury her remains alongside those of her husband, who died in 1984.

Where the pilot ended up: not King Island, Tasmania—at least not at first—after officials say the pilot took a snooze and overshot the planned landing by 30 miles or so. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is citing the pilot's  incapacitation,  reports the BBC, after the Piper PA-31 run by charter company Vortex Air didn't finish its 150-mile trip from Devonport as planned on Nov. 8.  During the cruise, the pilot fell asleep, resulting in the aircraft overflying King Island by 46 kilometers,  the ATSB says in a statement. The AP notes the plane was on autopilot, and the  issue became apparent  when air traffic controllers couldn't get in touch with the pilot as the plane glided past King Island, per a Vortex Air statement. The unidentified pilot eventually awoke, turned around, and landed safely on King Island, per Vortex, which adds the pilot's nap was  unintentional.  The Australian reports the pilot had had very little sleep the night before due to a personal emergency. The pilot was the only one onboard the nine-passenger aircraft. Newsweek cites a 2013 poll of 500 pilots that shows this type of fatigue may not be so unusual: More than half of those surveyed said they'd fallen asleep while on the flight deck. An investigation is ongoing by both the ATSB and Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and Vortex says it's trying to help the pilot  safely return to full duties,  per the AP.

Members of the Think Long Committee include billionaire Google chairman Eric Schmidt and philanthropist Eli Broad, as well as former governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Condoleezza Rice. The group's plan is to boost tax revenue for education and to pay down the state's debt by relying on an  ideological hybrid  of ideas from both the right and the left, spokesman Nathan Gardels tells the San Francisco Chronicle. The proposal would lower California's personal income tax and sales tax rates, but impose a 5% tax on currently untaxed services such as legal work and accounting. Under the proposal, couples earning up to $45,000 would pay no state income tax; those earning up to $95,000 would pay 2%; and those earning more would pay 7.5%, with a 1% surcharge for Californians earning more than $1 million. The corporate tax rate would be cut from 8.84% to 7%. Committee founder Nicolas Berggruen has said he'll commit $20 million of his own funds to pass the measure, reports the Los Angeles Times.  The problem with most initiatives is funding,  said Gardels.  That's not a problem this group will have.

In the course of a relatively brief negotiating session at the White House, Trump largely sided with Democratic leaders as they pushed for the three-month deal, per the AP. He brushed aside calls from Republican congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for a longer extension to the debt limit, which Republicans had been aiming for to avoid having to take another vote on the politically toxic issue before the 2018 elections. The deal promises to speed the $7.9 billion Hurricane Harvey aid bill, which passed the House overwhelmingly Wednesday, to Trump's desk.

According to Lenny Bernstein, who spent 20 years there as a climate expert, the company knew about the link between fossil fuels and climate change in 1981—seven years before the issue truly became public. But for the next 27 years, Exxon refused to publicly admit those realities, even as it funded climate deniers, reports the Guardian. In an email, posted by the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University in October and now included in a report on climate disinformation, Bernstein says Exxon weighed evidence in support of climate change when considering whether to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. As it contained 70% carbon dioxide, Exxon projected it would be the  largest point source of CO2 in the world,  Bernstein says. The email shows Exxon knew  climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making,  the director of the ethics institute says. While many compare the case to the tobacco industry denying the dangers of smoking, she argues  this is an order of magnitude greater moral offense, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilization.   The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion,  says an Exxon rep, though a Harvard professor notes the White House and National Academy of Sciences issued reports on climate change in the 1970s. Greenpeace says Exxon has given $30 million to those backing climate denial over the years; Exxon says it doesn't do so now.","Scientist: Exxon Knew of Climate Change in 1981, Lied","Scientist: Exxon Knew of Climate Change in ____, Lied",1981,Copy( 1981 ),0

Authorities charged Hudy Muldrow Sr., 77, with two counts of vehicular homicide in the deaths of 10-year-old student Miranda Vargas and 51-year-old teacher Jennifer Williamson. More than 40 others were injured, some seriously, in the May 17 crash between the bus and a dump truck, reports the AP. The bus was one of three carrying students and teachers from a middle school in Paramus on a field trip to a historic site in New Jersey, about 30 miles away.

"(Jul 15, 2017  5:30 AM CDT) A raging fire in a Honolulu high-rise that authorities say had no sprinklers left three dead, 12 injured, and sent hundreds fleeing as smoke billowed from the upper floors, the AP reports. The dead were found on the 26th floor, where the fire broke out around 2:15pm and then spread to the 28th floor of the Marco Polo residences, says Fire Chief Manuel Neves. Firefighters were searching the damaged areas to make sure no additional people perished. The 36-floor building near Waikiki was built in 1971, before sprinklers were required.  Without a doubt if there were sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin,  Neves says. Four of the injured, including a firefighter, were hospitalized in serious condition. Karen Hastings, 71, was in her 31st-floor apartment when she smelled smoke, ran on to her balcony, and looked down to see flames below her. Windows blew out and then, she says,  the fire just blew up and went flying right out the windows. And that was like a horror movie.  As she and a neighbor ran through the haze down 14 floors until they found a safe stairwell to get some air, Hastings saw someone lying on a ledge,  and I don't know whether he made it.  The blaze was mostly confined to a single section of the vast, wave-shaped building, and only the units immediately above it and to the side of it were evacuated, while many residents stayed inside.",Fire in Hawaii Condo Without Sprinklers Kills 3,Fire in Hawaii Condo Without Sprinklers Kills ____,3,Trans( three ),1

The firefighters had tied themselves together with a rope and formed a human chain as they searched the pool, but one of the men slipped and sent them all underwater, reports the New York Times. It appears they became trapped in whirlpool-like conditions.  Suddenly a strong current occurred in the area, causing all victims to spin in the water while all their equipment came off of them,  says a Malaysian rescue official. The men were pulled unconscious from the water about 30 minutes later. (They are remembered here.) The water in the pool is typically chest high, reports the New Straits Times, but heavy rain may have caused a nearby floodwall to give in, making conditions far more dangerous. And because the men had been searching along the surface of the water, they weren't wearing scuba equipment.

"(Oct 1, 2015  6:44 AM CDT) After making it to the final round of six, a group of business school classmates on Saturday took home the $1 million Hult Prize, beating more than 20,000 applicants in an attempt to present a real-world solution to this problem: How can early childhood education be improved for 10 million children under age 6 in urban slums by 2020? Calling themselves Team IMPCT, the students from the National Chengchi University in Taiwan proposed investing in existing informal day care centers many women in the developing world already run out of their own homes by extending access to low-cost capital via micro equity, they report on Indiegogo.  This concept is so powerful because it means the profits generated by the schools can be reinvested into growth or increasing quality instead of being used to cover interest payments for loans,  they write. Investors will receive a portion of the day care centers' profits as a dividend, which they can use to reinvest in other projects, enabling a  sustainable investment cycle.  The team has already built a test center in El Salvador with the help of an NGO that specializes in transitional housing and the $58,000 they raised on Indiegogo. NPR reports the caregiver they partnered with had previously watched four children in La Cuchilla; she received education-related training and now runs a newly built center with 20 students who still pay only $2 a day. The $1 million prize money will go in part to launching at minimum six more pilot schools; each will require an estimated $8,000 to jump-start, with the goal being 30,000 schools by 2020.  Meeting Bill Clinton and winning a million dollars felt amazing,  one teammate says.  But the feeling when we went into school the first day [earlier this month] and saw kids learning that wouldn't have had the opportunity otherwise felt even better.

The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says the five officers—who tackled protester Rakeem Jones instead of the man who sucker-punched him as he was led out of the Crown Coliseum—have been reprimanded and placed on probationary status for a year for  unsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies  of the department, ABC News reports. Three of them were demoted in rank and suspended without pay for five days, while another two were suspended for three days.

He said that when deciding the punishment, his office took into account the  past bravery and exemplary conduct  of the deputies. John McGraw, 78, has been charged with assault and disorderly conduct for allegedly punching Jones.

National Transportation Safety Board members unanimously voted to accept a final report that found widespread fault in the 2018 crash in upstate New York, the AP reports. The NTSB found that the crash was likely caused by Prestige Limousine's  egregious disregard for safety  that resulted in brake failure on a long downhill stretch of road and that ineffective state oversight contributed.

Alberto Zerain Berasatei of Spain and Mariano Galacan of Argentina were part of a team that began climbing the world's ninth-highest mountain, Nanga Parbat, this month. But while all other team members have returned to base camp, Berasatei, 55, and Galacan, 37, are missing, reports Reuters. The owner of tour company Summit Karakoram, which arranged the climb, tells AFP the pair reached a height of 20,000 feet last week but were then forced to spend three days in a tent due to bad weather.  They pushed for the summit again as the weather got better but lost contact with our staff,  he says. The owner adds sherpas believe the climbers are above 23,000 feet on the 26,660-foot-tall mountain, a height he says is  impossible  for rescuers—though Reuters reports rescuers were scouring the mountain Wednesday as poor weather kept helicopters grounded. A rep for Summit Karakoram tells Xinhua that the  altitude is not considered dangerous, but the two mountaineers chose the hardest route which has been successfully completed only once in history.  Hopes of finding the men alive don't appear to be high.  In such weather conditions and without adequate food supply, survival appears unlikely,  says a rep for the Alpine Club of Pakistan.

Phillip Fleitz, 31, of Indianapolis, was handcuffed and ordered Monday to immediately begin serving the sentence, the AP reports. Fleitz's two co-defendants previously received probation for their roles, and a defense attorney argued Fleitz should receive a similar sentence. But the judge agreed with US Attorney Jimmy Kitchen, who said:  Fleitz was the architect. It was his idea. He was the first to do it  and enlisted the others.  This was a sophisticated and serious scheme,  US District Judge Maurice Cohill Jr. said in imposing the sentence. From September 2011 to February 2013, Fleitz and two others earned between $2,000 to $3,000 weekly by conspiring to violate a 2003 law designed to protect cellphone and computer users from unwanted marketing and porn emails and text messages. The computer and text-message spam included Internet links. Those who received the text messages were told they had won Best Buy gift cards that could be accessed by clicking the links. In reality, those who responded were routed to pages controlled by marketing companies that harvest email addresses and other information.

"(Nov 12, 2016  2:12 PM) Wednesday was the 50th anniversary of Paul McCartney's death—at least according to what Inverse calls  the original crazy fan theory.  The conspiracy theory appears to have started with an anonymous call to a radio DJ in 1969, a month after the Beatles had officially broken up. The caller claimed McCartney had died in a car crash on Nov. 9, 1966 and been replaced by a lookalike named William Campbell. The theory was picked up by a trio of fanzines, and a segment of Beatles fans ran with it, finding clues throughout the band's discography. They claim the fatal car crash was referenced in  A Day in the Life  and  I Am the Walrus.  They say it explains McCartney being dressed as a corpse on the cover of Abbey Road and looking  ghost-like  in photos from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. And it goes deeper. Fans pointed to Lennon repeating  I buried Paul  on  Strawberry Fields Forever  and someone saying  Turn me on dead man  when  Revolution No. 9  is reversed. And on and on. While McCartney is almost certainly still alive, Inverse has its own conspiracy theory: Lennon, a  witty and surreal humorist,  planted the clues on purpose then made that anonymous call after the band broke up and he was mad at McCartney. What else, Inverse argues, could explain Lennon singing  Here's another clue for you all; the Walrus was Paul  in  Glass Onion ?

He was 75. Havel was his country's first democratically elected president after the nonviolent  Velvet Revolution  that ended four decades of repression by a regime he ridiculed as  Absurdistan.  As president, he oversaw the country's bumpy transition to democracy and a free-market economy, as well its peaceful 1993 breakup into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Shy and bookish, with a wispy mustache and unkempt hair, Havel came to symbolize the power of the people to peacefully overcome totalitarian rule.  Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred,  Havel famously said. It became his revolutionary motto which he said he always strove to live by. He was detained countless times and spent four years in communist jails. His letters from prison to his wife became one of his best-known works. Letters to Olga blended deep philosophy with a stream of stern advice to the spouse he saw as his mentor and best friend, and who tolerated his reputed philandering and other foibles. Havel, who left office in 2003, was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize, and collected dozens of other accolades worldwide for his efforts as a global ambassador of conscience, defending the downtrodden from Darfur to Burma.

"(Jul 7, 2017  6:05 AM CDT) The Illinois House voted to override Gov. Bruce Rauner's vetoes of a budget package, giving the state its first spending blueprint in more than two years and ending the nation's longest fiscal stalemate since at least the Great Depression, the AP reports. Thursday's action eases some financial woes, but it's fueled by a permanent 32% increase in the income tax rate, raising $5 billion more annually, and it reduces spending by more than $2 billion. Illinois is staring down a $6.2 billion annual deficit and $14.7 billion in past-due bills. Lawmakers, culminating two straight weeks of a special session that began ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year, approved the bill to raise taxes by a 71-42 vote. A plan to spend $36 billion in the fiscal year that began July 1 was approved 74-37; an override requires 71 votes. The income tax increase means individuals will pay 4.95% instead of 3.75%; the corporate rate jumps to 7% from 5.25%. The standoff, which GOP Rep. David Harris called  immoral,  had had statewide effects, with road construction work shut down and public universities cut to the bone.  Today, Republicans and Democrats stood together to enact a bipartisan, balanced budget and end a destructive, 736-day impasse,  said Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, who had to call upon previously reluctant Democrats to keep the veto-override supermajority intact. Rauner had rejected the budget plan because he saw no indication the Democratic-controlled Legislature would send him the  structural  changes he has demanded, including a statewide property-tax freeze.

Now, in just two years staring at a patch of sky not much bigger than your fist, Kepler has discovered more than 60 planets and more than 2,300 planet candidates.  In other words,  our galaxy is positively loaded with planets.  But the new systems aren't much like ours. The planets have relatively brief orbits around their stars; the longest is 143 days, while the shortest is six. The planets range in size from 1.5 times bigger than Earth to larger than Jupiter. But as Kepler continues to probe a field of 150,000 stars (it measures any changes in these stars' brightness, which would signal that a planet is crossing in front of the star), it's expected to find more  Earth-sized  than  Jupiter-sized  planets, Discovery notes—and the systems it finds in the future are likely to look more like ours.",Scientists Find 11 New Planetary Systems,Scientists Find ____ New Planetary Systems,11,Copy( 11 ),0

The Montgomery Advertiser reports Timothy Dean Pettiway has been charged with theft from a gaming establishment on Indian lands after allegedly stealing $192,800 from Wind Creek Montgomery casino on Aug. 10. Federal prosecutors allege an employee left keys to two kiosks on top of a machine and that Pettiway retrieved them and used them to remove the box of $100 bills from kiosks 8 and 19. He allegedly took the boxes one at a time into a bathroom that his nephew, Jory D'Michael Travunn Dumas, was in; the emptied cash boxes were later found in a stall. Dumas, a former casino employee who had been fired for theft, was also arrested Tuesday, but he was dismissed from the case Friday after prosecutors said they mistakenly identified him as the one who had collected the keys. He has been advised that he's not immune from future charges. Pettiway was on Friday denied bond, with the judge citing his decades-long criminal history and the fact that the $192,800 remains missing.  A person with access to that much cash would have a reasonable opportunity to flee,  said US Magistrate Judge Gray Borden, per the Advertiser.

"(Apr 1, 2013  6:10 PM CDT) A clerical error allowed the man suspected of killing Colorado's prisons chief to be released from custody about four years early, officials said today. In 2008, Evan Ebel pleaded guilty to assaulting a prison guard in a court in rural Fremont County. He was to be sentenced to four additional years in prison, to be served after he completed the eight-year sentence that put him behind bars in 2008, according to a statement from the 11th Judicial District. However, the court clerk failed to note after the plea that the sentence was supposed to be served  consecutively,  or after, Ebel's current one. So the legal system recorded it as one to be served  concurrently,  or at the same time. So on Jan. 28, prisons officials saw that Ebel had finished his court-ordered sentence and had no option but to release him. Two months later he was dead after a shootout with authorities in Texas. The gun he used was the same used to shoot prisons chief Tom Clements, and police believe Ebel was involved in the death of a Domino's delivery man, Nathan Leon, in Denver.",Colorado Gunman Released 4 Years Early by Mistake,Colorado Gunman Released ____ Years Early by Mistake,4,Trans( four ),1

Parker, born in 1960, doesn't profess to have typed his way to his immense total, a collection that includes titles like The 2007-2012 Outlook for Public Building Stacking Chairs Excluding Bar, Bowling Center, Cafeteria, Library, Restaurant, and School Stacking Chairs in India. After all, doing so would mean he has churned out six books a day since the moment he was born, per Now I Know. Rather, for about 15 years Parker has owned a patent for computer software that writes books for him by employing info that's publicly available. A 2008 profile in the New York Times said he generated his collection via those algorithms, six or seven programmers, and 60 to 70 computers. Most books aren't actually printed until someone buys a copy, and there are many titles to choose from: Phys.org in late 2012 reported another 700,000 books on Amazon are listed under Parker's company, ICON Group International; it looks like nearly another 100,000 have been added since then.

The Science of Us speaks to Jenn Schwaner, a 43-year-old with a long resume as a court reporter who says she tends to get  about three or four hours, and I never feel tired.  She's been unusual—experts figure about 1% of the population consists of short sleepers—ever since she was 3 years old and would get up at 5am with her dad. And now that she has kids of her own, things haven't been much different: While she was married, her husband would sleep during the day and work at night, while she  was up doing all the things I normally did during the day while I was also nursing the baby at night. It was just the way it was. It never bothered me.  A typical schedule now involves getting up at 3am or 4am and spending much of the day taking care of her kids, who include three biological and three foster children. She gets to bed around midnight, she says.  My life is extremely hectic.  She says she tends to get stressed rather than tired; the sleeping pattern did, however, apparently take something of a toll on her marriage. With her husband a light sleeper, she would often have to sleep on the couch rather than allow her noises to wake him up. They're now divorced, which was  kind of a relief,  she says.

She was 78. Reno died from complications of Parkinson's disease, her goddaughter Gabrielle D'Alemberte tells the AP. Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters  I don't do spin,  served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century. One of the administration's most recognizable and polarizing figures, Reno faced criticism early in her tenure for the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas. After Waco, Reno figured into some of the controversies and scandals that marked the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying, and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. In the spring of 2000, Reno enraged her hometown's Cuban-American community when she authorized the armed seizure of 5-year-old Elian.

Just weeks after Aetna announced it plans to acquire Humana for more than $34 billion, this continued  buyout frenzy,  as the AP puts it, could whittle five of the country's largest health insurers down to just three, with UnitedHealth Group being the only entity left standing on its own. This deal, as well as the Aetna-Humana announcement earlier this month, has naturally caught the eye of antitrust regulators, who are expected to be looking into both mergers. Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish will continue to man the helm, adding  chairman  to his title, while Cigna CEO David Cordani will become president and head of operations. Reportedly, Cordani's role in the new company was a stalling point in talks that have been going on since last summer. Advantages to the deal—expected to close by the second half of 2016—include the ability to better negotiate rates with care providers and the chance to make larger technology investments, as well as the possibility of getting rid of $2 billion per year in overlap costs, industry analysts and Anthem officials tell the AP and the Journal.

It reveals a  shocking  number of hidden names, Madigan tells the Times. She leaves her post in January with a promise from her successor to keep up the investigation launched in August. Only 185 of 690 accused priests were publicly identified by the church as facing credible allegations.  I want to express again the profound regret of the whole church for our failures to address the scourge of clerical sexual abuse,  says Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago and an ally of Pope Francis.  It is the courage of victim-survivors that has shed purifying light on this dark chapter in church history.

"(Apr 16, 2015  7:03 AM CDT) The search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be expanded by another 23,000 square miles in the Indian Ocean if the jetliner isn't found by May, officials said today, affirming their commitment to not give up until it's located. The announcement removes some ambiguity about the future of the search as it was never made clear what would happen if the plane is not located. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters that so far 61% of the current 23,000-square-mile search area has been scoured off Australia's west coast. The remaining 39% will be searched by the end of May, he said.  If the aircraft is not found ... we have collectively decided to extend the search to another [23,000 square miles] within the highest-probability area,  he said. However, searchers are hopeful they'll find the plane in the current search area, he said. Liow said the two areas together would cover 95% of the flight path of the Boeing 777, which went missing on March 8 of last year.  We are confident we are searching in the right area,  said Liow's Australian counterpart, Warren Truss.  If the plane is in the area we will find it,  he said.  Australia and Malaysia have been sharing the cost and we will continue to do that. We are confident we will be able to fund whatever is necessary.  The first phase cost $93.6 million; the next, which the two ministers expect to take the rest of this year, is set to cost $39 million. The lower cost is because the equipment has already been purchased.

"(Sep 29, 2020  12:01 AM CDT) President Trump on Monday announced that the federal government will be distributing 150 million rapid coronavirus tests to states over the next few weeks. The Trump administration is pushing the use of the point-of-care tests, which deliver results within 15 minutes, in K-12 settings so more schools can return to in-person learning, Axios reports. The move will  allow every state on a very regular basis [to] test every teacher who needs it,  Trump said, per CNN. Axios notes students, too, could be tested weekly. Trump said 100 million tests  will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and [as] fast as they can,  while the rest will go to vulnerable communities including nursing homes. Axios notes these types of tests are not as accurate as PCR swab tests, for which results take days.  Governors have the flexibility to use these tests as they deem fit, but we strongly encourage governors to utilize them in settings that are uniquely in need of rapid low-tech point of care tests, like opening and keeping open our K-12 schools, supporting critical infrastructure and first responders, responding to outbreaks specifically in certain demographics or locations, and screening or surveillance in congregate settings,  said the White House's coronavirus testing czar. The move is a reversal from Trump's earlier railing against testing, a point he addressed Monday.  As we massively increase testing capacity, we will identify more cases in asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations. This should not cause undue alarm,  he said.

Ryan, of Wisconsin, was the Republican candidate for vice president in 2012. There had been much speculation about his ambitions for 2016. But with the start of the new Congress last week, Ryan became chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, trade, Social Security, and health care.  After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided not to run for president,  Ryan says in a statement.  Our work at the House Ways and Means Committee over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward, and my job as chairman deserves undivided attention.  Running for president as a member of the House would be a daunting task. Only one sitting House member has ever been elected president—James Garfield in 1880. Still, Ryan has a national following. He is a favorite among conservatives for developing detailed plans for reining in federal spending. Those plans, however, have made him a villain among many Democrats and liberal groups. Just approaching his 45th birthday at the end of the month, Ryan has time to consider future presidential elections.  It's clear our country needs a change in direction.

A Ukrainian interior ministry official says the Boeing 777 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, though it's too early to confirm the claim. (US intelligence agrees that a missile is to blame.) The plane, which originated in Amsterdam and was bound for Kuala Lumpur, was flying at 33,000 feet when it  began to drop; afterwards it was found burning on the ground on Ukrainian territory,  a witness tells Interfax. It came down over territory held by separatists about 25 miles short of the Russian border, near the city of Donetsk, reports the LA Times. The region has seen fierce fighting in recent days. Immediately afterward, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said his troops  did not take action against any airborne targets,  and pro-Russian separatists also denied responsibility. The plane appeared to have broken apart before hitting the ground, reports the AP, with one of its reporters counting at least 22 bodies at the crash site.

And that  line slap  is how the Thomas fire, the second largest wildfire in California’s history, reportedly began. The resulting electrical arc  deposited hot, burning or molten material onto the ground, in a receptive fuel bed,  sparking a blaze that would merge with another caused by SCE equipment, the Ventura County Fire Department said Wednesday following a 15-month investigation, per the Los Angeles Times and USA Today. Two people died in the fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties over 40 days. In a Wednesday statement, SCE questioned the findings and said  final resolution as to cause or responsibility  will have to be decided in court. Though SCE acknowledged it was likely on the hook for the smaller blaze that started in Santa Paula, it says its investigators found evidence its equipment wasn't behind the larger blaze, whose  ignition may have been independently responsible for a significant portion of the Thomas Fire damages.

"(Feb 4, 2015  8:50 AM) More details from  one of the darkest chapters of Australia's maritime history  are coming to light, nearly 400 years after they occurred. On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered  by accident.  Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more:  This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia—albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here—so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.

Drones have been mainly used by the military, but governments, businesses, farmers, and others are making plans to join the market. Many universities are starting or expanding drone programs.

Activists, however, aren't happy. Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, which had filed for a preliminary injunction, was planning to make legal arguments  to prevent a lifetime of captivity  for the elephants during a Thursday hearing.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service approved the transfer in January. Also, the zoo notes, the preliminary injunction did not prohibit the relocation from going forward.

She was hoping Letterman would take her advice to hire some women or people of color, but he didn't even read the article. He did, however, recently agree to a sit-down to mark the article's 10th anniversary, and, at Scovell's request, he read it in advance of their interview.

An impressed Scovell writes,  It’s not often that you speak truth to power and power responds, 'Oops, sorry.'  But her piece isn't all roses. Though she applauds Letterman for, back in 2009, quickly copping to the sexual liaisons he'd had with female staffers rather than calling them liars, as well as for—in 2019—copping to his  sloppiness  in not hiring more women, she also calls him  oblivious  about what she terms  TV’s Golden Age of Ass Grabbing  and notes that he gave no indication he understood the importance of the  power differential  in workplace relationships of the sort he had with his subordinates, even if they were consensual. And then there's the double standards at play with regard to how he was treated after his scandal versus how a woman would have been treated. But ultimately, she writes, his willingness to talk to her is important, and more men should do the same: In the #MeToo era, rather than men taking the  shut up and listen  approach, she says,  we need more dialogue.","10 Years Later, Letterman Apologizes to Writer Who Called Him Out","____ Years Later, Letterman Apologizes to Writer Who Called Him Out",10,Copy( 10 ),0

When he sat down to do this year's taxes, he found it again, checked the numbers, and discovered it was worth $9 million. His lawyer called the state lottery on March 15, less than two weeks before the ticket would have expired, reports the Chicago Tribune.

"(Dec 8, 2018  3:00 PM) Worried you have cancer? One day you may take a 10-minute test with a touted 90% success rate—though some experts are raising doubts, the Guardian reports. Devised in Australia, the test uses a color-changing liquid and a new cancer-detection approach that could help people pre-screen before having more thorough tests.  A major advantage of this technique is that it is very cheap and extremely simple to do, so it could be adopted in the clinic quite easily,  says study co-author Laura Carrascosa. The test is simple: A patient's DNA is placed in water containing gold nanoparticles. DNA from cancer cells will cling to the gold, making the water's color stay pink; if the cells are healthy, they bind differently and make the water turn blue, per the Smithsonian.  We certainly don't know yet whether it's the holy grail for all cancer diagnostics, but it looks really interesting  and doesn't require a biopsy or complicated equipment, says team leader Matt Trau. Sadly, it can't spot the size or location of a tumor, and its  90% success rate  is furrowing at least one brow:  What if you had cancer and you were one of the 10% whose true cancer was not detected?  writes Gary Schwitzer at Health News Review. A California doctor tells USA Today he's concerned whether the test will trigger false positives, since cancer is actually uncommon. Other  simple  tests have emerged lately, including one that detects up to 10 cancer types and another that can spot eight kinds of cancer before symptoms emerge, reports MarketWatch. The Australian test is in early development and won't be out anytime soon.",Easy Cancer Test Takes Just 10 Minutes,Easy Cancer Test Takes Just ____ Minutes,10,Copy( 10 ),0

NATO forces, the plan says, will turn over the country to Afghan forces by 2014, but will keep a presence in the country long after that—meaning Obama will need to convince NATO allies to stick around, despite their war-weary public at home. Military officials will likely applaud the move, the Monitor notes, adding that they've long maintained that victory in Afghanistan would take time, a belief Obama hasn't publicly supported until now.  The clock on Afghanistan has had quite a bit more time added to it, and that provides a lot more pressure on the Taliban psychologically and it will physically,  says one official.

The 43-year-old  appeared stunned  at the severity of the sentence, reports the Detroit News, but the judge said it was necessary to send a message about politicians getting rich on the public dime.  A man with the charisma and ability of Mr. Kilpatrick chose to use his talents on personal aggrandizement and enrichment when he had the potential to do so much for the city,  declared Judge Nancy Edmunds, as per the AP. Prior to the sentence, Kilpatrick took the high road:  I'm ready to go so the city can move on,  he said.  The people here are suffering, they're hurting.

In audio tape of a 911 call released by police, a woman identifying herself as the mother of Marques Green said she carried the gun in her purse, and had set her purse down after getting home.  My son just shot himself and I'm not getting a pulse,  screamed the woman, who gave her name as Elizabeth Green in the call yesterday afternoon.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm not getting a pulse ...

Police say the boy was wounded in the chest and pronounced dead at a hospital shortly afterward. The woman told the 911 dispatcher:  His eyes are open, but he's out.  A neighbor says she heard a woman screaming and ran to her balcony to see what was happening.  She was holding her son and he was lifeless, just completely lifeless,  Amanda Reed, who lives across the street, tells WLWT-TV.

"(Apr 28, 2014  6:15 PM CDT) How can more than $4 million in Medicare money flow through a small doctor's office in Brooklyn? Seeking answers, the New York Times reports on the world of physical therapy—where demand is on the rise, treatments vary wildly by region, and authorities are cracking down on doctors who cheat the system. The Brooklyn doctor, Wael Bakry, insists he's no cheat, saying he actually runs three offices that give a total of 1,950 patients an average of 94 treatments per year. That's more than triple the national average, but Brooklyn physical therapists tend to bill patients more than counterparts around the country. Why? According to federal authorities, Brooklyn is a hot spot for physical therapists who cheat the system. Factor in aging Baby Boomers who need more medical help, and the comparatively loose guidelines of physical therapy, and it's all too easy:  An area like physical therapy is a bit gray because there’s no set guideline on how much a given patient needs,  says a professor who suggests variances may be explained by  more entrepreneurial physicians.  A US physical therapist bills on average $49,000 to Medicare annually, so Bakry's numbers do stand out—yet he says he's just successful. Meanwhile, Medicare fraud stories are rife around the 'Net—with an ambulance service indicted in a $1.5 million scheme, Bloomberg News reports, and 10 people charged in a $69.4 million scheme in Houston just last week, the Houston Chronicle reports.",How One Therapist Billed Medicare for $4M,How One Therapist Billed Medicare for $____M,4,Copy( 4 ),0

The  not-so-bad stuff  in the tax deal  expires at the end of 2011,  setting up slower growth in 2012. That means that in an election year, there’ll be  pressure on Democrats to offer Republicans something, anything, to improve economic prospects.  One big example:  Republicans may try using the prospect of a rise in the payroll tax to undermine Social Security finances.  Meanwhile, Obama is railing against the left for being unable to accept a  compromise in the national interest,  Krugman notes.

"(Dec 7, 2011  5:02 AM) As the US prepares to mark 70 years since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, some servicemen who survived the attack have returned to the site permanently. The ashes of Lee Soucy, who died last year at the age of 90, have been interred in the USS Utah with the help of a Navy diver. The ship still lies where it sank in 1941 and holds the remains of dozens of his shipmates who died in the attack. The ashes of Vernon Olsen will be placed in the USS Arizona, on which 1,177 of his shipmates died. Three others, whose ships were salvaged for scrap, will have their ashes scattered in the harbor today.  They want to return and be with the shipmates that they lost during the attack,  a retired sailor who coordinates the ceremonies tells AP. Members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association have gathered at the site every Dec. 7 for more than 50 years. But as membership dwindles and the health of survivors declines, the organization has decided to disband at the end of this year, the New York Times reports.

But they saw an advertisement for IVF, undertook the treatment for two years at a fertility clinic, and gave birth on April 19 to a baby boy conceived using her egg and her husband's sperm, AFP reports. They went through two failed cycles of IVF before successfully conceiving, the Hindustan Times reports.

The five-ship whaling fleet set out in November and returned to port Friday with the minke whale carcasses. The country's Fisheries Agency says the mission was necessary for  research for the purpose of studying the ecological system in the Antarctic Sea,  but critics say Japan is simply hunting whales for meat, even though the practice of eating whale meat has dropped off sharply in the country. Environmentalists and animal rights groups are once again calling for an end to the whaling practice. Japan is a signatory to the International Whaling Commission, which put a moratorium on hunting whales starting in 1986, but Tokyo claims that because whales are allowed to be killed for scientific research purposes, its hunts are legit; the country justifies the consumption of whale meat by explaining that the meat is simply a byproduct of the research and must be used. An International Court of Justice ruling ordered Tokyo to end the practice, leading to Japan killing no whales in the 2014-15 season, but 333 whales were killed during the 2015-16 season after Japan  re-tooled  the program, per Reuters.

The unidentified adult becomes the second person to die from the infamous disease this year. A 16-year-old star baseball player died of the plague in June. Both victims likely had a rare septicemic form of the plague, which is hard to diagnose because it doesn't include the typical swelling of lymph nodes seen in most plague cases. Cases of the plague are rare in the United States, and deaths are even rarer. On average, seven human plague cases are reported in the United States every year, but Colorado had eight plague cases of its own last year. Officials are attributing that to a boom in the animal population. In septicemic plague, the bacteria enters the blood stream and creates flu-like symptoms.

Crueler still, while the disorder is highly rare it's also genetic, and as the Washington Post reports, it's  not unusual  for the disease to affect more than one child in a family (here are two examples). In the case of Les and Celeste Chappell, four of their 10 children had the diagnosis, and three have now died—all in July, over the course of three days, in the family's home in Springville, Utah. As the Post reports, Elizabeth, 19, and James, 15—who had had the toughest time—were being tube-fed. When the time came for Les and Celeste to do the same for Christopher, 20, they reflected on the experience of their other two children and decided not to—and they felt that choice should extend to Elizabeth and James. So on July 13, the feeding tubes were removed, medication was given to ease any pain, and the family begin to pray over a process they were warned could take weeks.

The 26 sick passengers were part of the same tour group and were suspected to have contracted their gastrointestinal illness before they boarded the flight in Santiago, Qantas said. Network Ten television reported that the sick passengers were Australian high school students returning to their hometown of Melbourne after attending the Roman Catholic event World Youth Day in Brazil. The New South Wales state Health Ministry said in a statement that the passengers developed vomiting and diarrhea consistent with norovirus infection, a common cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Australia and elsewhere. The ill passengers were moved to seats at the rear of the plane near where four toilets were located, Australian Associated Press reported. The Boeing 747 was met by ambulance paramedics who treated the sick passengers in quarantine. Qantas said other passengers were advised to keep a close eye on their health over the next two days and to seek medical advice if they feel ill.",26 Passengers Quarantined After Falling Ill on Flight,____ Passengers Quarantined After Falling Ill on Flight,26,Copy( 26 ),0
"(Apr 12, 2016  8:41 AM CDT) A new wave of political attacks launched Tuesday morning, but the target isn't one of the five presidential candidates left standing: It's Hillary Clinton's potential VP, Julian Castro. In what Politico is calling a  preemptive strike,  a number of groups—many aligned with Bernie Sanders—are trying to render the potential  major asset  (he's young, Latino, was San Antonio's mayor) unusable. It's the 41-year-old's current gig, as Housing and Urban Development secretary, that's at the root of the attack, which targets mortgage sales. The allegations, per the groups' DontSellOurHomesToWallStreet.org site:  HUD promised to help homeowners avoid foreclosure by selling more overdue mortgage loans to nonprofit community organizations rather than Wall Street banks.   But,  they continue,  in reality HUD’s two most recent sales have sent 98% of the mortgages straight to Wall Street—and at a HUGE discount, almost half off!  HUD disputes the figure. Politico explains that the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program has since 2010 let mortgages that are barreling toward foreclosure be sold to  qualified bidders  whose goal is supposed to be to get the loans back in good standing. Under Castro, progressives feel it's basically been  a fire sale for Wall Street firms,  in Politico's words. They'd rather nonprofits and others more invested in the local communities purchase the mortgages. Since that's seemingly not what's happening, they argue Castro isn't a true progressive and is helping Wall Street over minority communities.",Now the 2016 VP Attacks Begin,Now the ____ VP Attacks Begin,2016,Copy( 2016 ),0
"(May 22, 2020  11:13 AM CDT) A Fortune 500 company in Atlanta says it's out $100,000 because an ex-worker exploited the pandemic. Per a DOJ release, Santwon Antonio Davis, 34, is accused of defrauding the unnamed company by falsely claiming he had COVID-19 and fabricating medical records. The AP lays out the details of Davis' alleged scam, which started on March 19 when he claimed to supervisors at the company—which had told workers they'd get paid time off to quarantine if they tested positive—that his mother had been exposed to someone who had COVID-19, per an FBI agent's statement. Davis was told he was  low risk  and could still work, and his story soon started to evolve. Over the next few days, per the agent's statement, he first told a supervisor his mom had developed symptoms, then that she'd tested positive, then that he'd tested positive. When the company asked for his test results, he allegedly sent over a phony medical letter, which the company suspected was fake. They kept asking for his test results, which he never sent; he was eventually fired. In the meantime, the company shut down on March 23 to clean, paying its employees during the shutdown. It also made four of Davis' co-workers quarantine and paid them during that time.  The defendant caused unnecessary economic loss to his employer and distress to his co-workers and their families,  US Attorney Byung J.  BJay  Pak said in the release. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Davis has spent nearly a year and a half in prison since 2006, per Georgia Department of Corrections records. His convictions include theft, and damage to property. Davis appeared in court Thursday and was granted bond, per court records.","Feds: Man Made Up COVID Diagnosis, Cost Firm $100K","Feds: Man Made Up COVID Diagnosis, Cost Firm $____K",100,"Paraphrase( 100,000 , K )",1

"(Oct 14, 2016  7:45 AM CDT) To all the women living in Manhattan, now might be an economically sensible time to head over to SoHo and stock up on all your feminine products, because neighborhood pharmacy Thompson Chemists just might be waiving your 7%  pink tax.  Owner Jolie Alony tells Gothamist that she wants to  bring awareness on how it feels to be a woman, so the men actually get to feel it,  by which she is referring to the fact that women pay roughly 7% more for personal products marketed to women than they would for the equivalent product marketed to men, as a recent NYC Department of Consumer Affairs report found. The 7% difference is often called the  pink tax  or  tampon tax,  and the Daily Dot reports that there's more: Women's clothes cost more to dry clean, for example, and in many states menstrual products are actually taxed as luxury goods. On Monday, Alony posted two signs out front:  All female customers shop tax free  and  All male customers are subject to a 7% man tax.  It's a bit misleading, as Time reports, given pricing didn't change at all for men but was dropped 7% for women (Alony must still pay sales tax in full, so she's paying the difference out of pocket). She wasn't sure whether she would continue the promotion past Monday. And while she said that at the shop her female customers were  very, very happy  and the men  just laughed,  the story's gone viral and the pharmacy's Facebook page is riddled with one-star reviews and comments decrying the store's  sexist and hateful business practices  and calling the owners  idiots.

In just two years, they managed to squander an ocean of goodwill and hope, resulting in a trouncing at the hands of Republicans—and their long slog on the health care bill was to blame. That's the prevailing narrative, anyway. At Slate, William Saletan suggests this view forgets that the purpose of winning elections is to enact difficult, bold legislation—not the other way around. The  big picture isn't about winning or keeping power,  he writes.  It's about using it.  And for all the mud slung at the Democratic leadership, they used their power. The health care bill was hugely significant, and it's not going anywhere. Sure, Republicans can win back House seats that are historically theirs to begin with in the worst economy in decades.

Meanwhile, police video shows objects ranging from bricks to a tarp and fire extinguisher being hurled from the driver's window as the truck fled, eventually totaling one police cruiser and severely damaging another.

"(Jun 1, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) Frank Lucas, the former Harlem drug kingpin whose life and lore inspired the 2007 movie American Gangster, has died, a relative said Friday. Lucas, who was 88, died Thursday in New Jersey, nephew Aldwan Lassiter said. Lucas had been in declining health, according to his former lawyer. Raised in North Carolina, Lucas climbed the ranks of crime in Harlem in the 1960s and '70s, becoming a major drug dealer known for supplying huge amounts of particularly potent heroin, per the AP. He said it netted him millions, and authorities seized over $500,000 in cash when they raided his house in Teaneck, NJ, in 1975. He was convicted and sentenced to decades in prison, but he turned informant and was released after about five years. Lucas was quickly arrested again for drug dealing, on a much smaller scale. He served seven more years, getting out again in 1991. Lucas' story became the basis for the Ridley Scott-directed American Gangster, starring Denzel Washington as Lucas and Russell Crowe as Richard  Richie  Roberts. The film got awards buzz but also brought scrutiny of claims about Lucas' legend, particularly a portrayal of him smuggling drugs in US soldiers' caskets during the Vietnam War; he said in 2008 he transported heroin via coffin just once. There was also pushback on an assertion that Lucas rooted out law enforcement corruption, but a suit on that was thrown out. As for Lucas' unquestioned role in supplying heroin that killed some users, he told the AP in 2007 that he regretted it.  I did some terrible things. I'm awfully sorry that I did them. I really am,  he said. Lucas had another brush with the law in 2012: He pleaded guilty to lying to try cashing in twice on a $17,000 federal disability benefit check. He was sentenced to five years' probation, with prosecutors saying they agreed to it due to his poor health and age.","Denzel Played Him. Now, a Drug Kingpin Dead at 88","Denzel Played Him.

As for why Rivera never called police,  He did not confess to me  individually.  He confessed to the group.  The Times notes that the story could be key to the case for a number of reasons: For one, there's no physical evidence connecting Hernandez and Etan, which makes confessions all the more crucial. And the fact that this alleged admission occurred just a few years after Etan disappeared could dispel some of the skepticism about the strength of his current confession. The Times also spoke with one of Hernandez's 11 siblings, Norma, who said that while he never confessed to her, she, along with the entire family, was aware of the prayer group confession.",Etan Patz Suspect Confessed to Church Group in '80s,Etan Patz Suspect Confessed to Church Group in '____s,80,"Subtract( 1980 , 1900 )",1

Roseann J. DiFrancesco apparently tripped and fell, causing her medical alert necklace to become caught on her walker, the Patriot-News reports. The result, says Coroner Charles Hall, was that her upper torso was suspended above the floor, creating pressure on her neck that cut off air and blood flow. Relatives had last spoken to DiFrancesco on Feb. 12. A visiting nurse found the woman dead in her bathroom Feb. 15, when the nurse entered DiFrancesco's home after unsuccessful attempts to summon her by knocking on the door.

Griffin also says his wife wanted $450,000 to take the kids on a 10-day winter-break vacation to St. Bart's; he gave her 10% of that amount. What Dias wants: the prenup voided (she says she was busy planning their wedding when she signed it and wasn't able to properly pore over his financial disclosures; he counters that they hired two wedding planners) and, per state law, the kids' lifestyle funded as it was pre-split.

"(Aug 17, 2020  5:47 PM CDT) Sharon Stone has not contracted the coronavirus, but the disease has spread throughout her family. Her grandmother and godmother died of COVID-19, she said, and her sister and her sister's husband are in a hospital now, the Los Angeles Times reports. In a video on Instagram, the actress discussed what her family is dealing with and the problems she's seen with the nation's response, including the lack of testing and leadership.  People are dying and fighting for their lives because there's nothing but lies,  she said. One of the conclusions Stone reached is that a change at the top is needed.  The only thing that's gonna change this is if you vote  for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, she said. Stone didn't mention President Trump by name but implored:  Please vote. And please, whatever you do, don't vote for a killer.  Also on Instagram, Stone posted a photo of her sister Kelly's hospital room. Her sister, who has lupus,  does not have an immune system  and had only gone to drugstore before contracting the coronavirus, per NBC.  One of you Non-Mask wearers did this,  Stone wrote. She also blames officials in Montana, where she and her family live. Her mother, who's had two heart attacks in the past month, has been unable to get tested; Stone suspects she's been an asymptomatic coronavirus carrier. In endorsing the Democratic ticket, Stone backed putting women in power generally.  The only countries that are doing well with COVID are the ones that have women in leadership,  she said. Stone's sister, who said she's  gasping for every breath,  added her own plea in another video.  Please do this for the people that you love,  she said.

Which probably seems realistic to the Sacramento prodigy, because Abraham just became one of the youngest children to ever graduate high school, earning him a letter of congratulations from Barack Obama.  It wasn't, like, easy, but it was not that hard either,  Abraham tells ABC 10.  The way my brain works is that when you give me something, information about that topic comes into my mind.

He's been homeschooled since skipping the first grade, while simultaneously taking courses from American River College. He'll enroll there as a full-time student in September, and expects to have an associate's degree by the end of the fall semester. From there, he hopes to attend Harvard, MIT, or Cornell.

"(Apr 22, 2020  12:02 AM CDT) The death toll in Canada's deadliest mass shooting has hit 22. That does not include the shooter, who went on a rampage spanning 16 crime scenes across five Nova Scotia communities from Saturday night until almost noon Sunday. The gunman also set fires that damaged or destroyed more than five structures and cars, the CBC reports. Among the victims killed were two nurses, Kristen Beaton and Heather O'Brien. Beaton, the mother of a 3-year-old son who was pregnant with a second child, was on her way to see a continuing care client when she was killed Sunday morning. Her husband says the province's failure to send out any emergency alerts doomed his wife. They didn't realize the gunman was wearing a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform and driving a police vehicle  until it was too late.   I would not have let my wife leave ... if I had that broadcast come across, that he was on the loose and he was driving an RCMP vehicle,  he says, per the CBC. He says the couple had been monitoring the situation Saturday night, but assumed it was under control by the following day when no alert was sent out, the Cape Breton Post reports. When he found out the gunman was still at large, he sent his wife a message warning her not to stop for anyone—but she was killed minutes later, never having had a chance to read it. Premier Stephen McNeil has been criticized for the lack of emergency alerts, but he says it's up to the RCMP to ask for such an alert and provide the details for it.  We had staff on hand in the morning to be able to do that,  he said.  But it was not requested.  Instead, the RCMP provided updates via Twitter.

"(Jun 16, 2015  9:48 AM CDT) The Obama administration is cracking down on artificial trans fats, calling them a threat to public health. The FDA said today it will require food companies to phase out the use of artificial trans fats almost entirely. Consumers aren't likely to notice much of a difference, but the administration says the move will reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year. The FDA made a preliminary determination in 2013 that trans fats no longer fall in the agency's  generally recognized as safe  category, and made that decision final today, giving food companies three years to phase them out. With trans fats off the list, any company that wants to use them will have to petition the FDA, which is unlikely to allow many uses. Once a staple of the American diet—think shortening and microwave popcorn—most trans fats are already gone. The FDA says between 2003 and 2012, consumer trans-fat consumption decreased about 78% as food companies used other kinds of oils. Still, the FDA says those trans fats still in the food supply are a public health concern. Scientists say there are no health benefits to trans fats, created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid (they're often called partially hydrogenated oils). Trans fats are used in processing food and in restaurants, usually to improve texture, shelf life, or flavor, but they can raise levels of  bad  cholesterol and lower  good  cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. The FDA hasn't targeted small amounts of trans fats that occur naturally in some meat and dairy products because they'd be too difficult to remove.

"(Jul 7, 2013  3:58 PM CDT) PETA is usually the one accusing others of animal cruelty. Not anymore. Though the group is well known for loudly objecting to things like goldfish racing and backpacks made from fur, it is now drawing attention for a very different reason: its animal shelter kills around 2,000 dogs and cats a year, while only adopting out a handful (19 last year, 24 the year before), the New York Times reports.  No-kill  shelters are now increasingly common amongst animal welfare groups. In 2003, 31,701 dogs and cats were euthanized in New York alone. Last year, the figure was down to 8,252. But PETA didn't get the memo. PETA says the animals it takes in are often too far gone to be saved.  It’s nice for people who’ve never worked in a shelter to have this idealistic view that every animal can be saved,  says a spokesperson.  They don’t see what awful physical and emotional pain these poor dogs and cats suffer.  But no-kill advocates disagree. The director of shelter medicine at the University of California, Davis, says she used to think that euthanasia was often the most humane option, but has now found that shelters offering better care to animals can lower disease and increase adoption numbers. She also says it isn't just a choice between adoption or death—some shelters take in stray cats, spay or neuter and vaccinate them, and then release them back.  The pieces for no-kill are in place,  she says.

"(Sep 29, 2016  11:31 AM CDT) Americans living in nearly 500,000 homes in the US don't have what the New York Times—in an eye-opening piece—calls  basic dignity.  That basic dignity includes running water, a bath or shower, or a working toilet. It's that last one plaguing rural black communities in the South, who are living in  deep, biting poverty  thanks in part to the still-lasting effects of slavery and Jim Crow. One woman whose family makes just $12,000 a year can't afford the $6,000 it would cost for a functioning septic tank. Instead, she runs a pipe from her toilet to the woods behind her house.  The smell gets so bad,  says another woman who uses the same system.  There's nothing we can do.  It's a problem without an easy solution. Without addressing deep-seated poverty, there will always be Americans who can't afford septic tanks or other sewage solutions. And with an impoverished tax base, municipalities can't afford to expand their sewer systems to cover rural homes. Meanwhile, it's a public health hazard for families already at risk due to poverty. Rain can cause makeshift sewer lines to back up into homes, and improperly disposed-of sewage can get into drinking water. While it's illegal to not have a functioning septic tank or sewer line, fining people isn't seen as a long-term solution. And it means people have ended up with criminal records simply because they are too poor to afford plumbing.

The museum, a companion to the 9/11 memorial, was supposed to be finished by this year's 11th anniversary, but officials now say that's not possible. The holdup stems from a financial battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation that controls the memorial and museum, reports the AP. The Port Authority says the foundation owes it $300 million for infrastructure and updated project costs; the foundation counters that the port owes it money because of project delays. Personal items that families have donated to the museum are stuck in storage while the dispute, which has slowed down work since late last year, drags on.  We were supposed to get a contemplative area nearby where we could sit and pray, visit,  says one woman whose sister worked on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's south tower.

The girls were found at a horse farm in western Minnesota after police executed a search warrant, Lakeville police Lt. Jason Polinski told the Star Tribune. Gianna and Samantha Rucki, now 16 and 17, hadn't been seen in public since April 2013 after disappearing in a custody dispute. The girls' mother, Sandra Grazzini-Rucki, was arrested last month in Florida but has declined to provide information on their whereabouts to investigators.  Both Samantha and Gianna were found safe and in seemingly good health,  Lakeville police said in statement Wednesday.  The sisters will return to Dakota County where the unification process can begin.  Grazzini-Rucki is in the Dakota County jail after her arrest on charges of felony deprivation of parental rights. In November 2013, a Dakota County judge granted the girls' father, David Rucki, full custody of his children. Police believed an underground network of family court critics was hiding the Rucki sisters. Polinski said evidence obtained from a search of a woman's home in St. Cloud led them to the White Horse Ranch. The woman is a supporter of the  Protective Parent  movement that argues the family courts are broken and frequently award custody to abusive parents.

Most of the money they make from selling the coins will be taxed at the highest level, meaning state and federal taxes will eat up almost half of what the coins the couple discovered on their property are worth, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The couple could try to argue that the find should be taxed as a capital gain, but it would be a tough case to win, and legal proceedings would make their names public, potentially bringing a flood of treasure-hunters to their property, an accountant says.  They are going to pay the ordinary income tax and be happy with it,  he predicts.

For that price, explorer and retired naval officer Victor Vescovo will take daring travelers to the deepest point on Earth, Challenger Deep in Mariana Trench, which has been visited by fewer people than have been to space. With his exploration company Caladan Oceanic, Vescovo—just the fourth person to visit the spot—has already filled up two eight-day expeditions scheduled for May, per Popular Mechanics. Travelers no more than 220 pounds will take a retired US Navy ship to the Western Pacific Ocean, 200 miles southwest of Guam, before descending 35,843 feet in the $37 million deep-ocean submarine, Limiting Factor, reports Bloomberg. The view: a whole lot of black.  Once you get past a thousand feet or two, it starts to get really dark really quickly,  Vescovo tells Bloomberg.  Then it's just really peaceful, and there's virtually no sense of motion in any direction.  At the bottom, travelers can retrieve rocks and even bacterial colonies using a mechanical arm. And  it's likely you'll see a new species,  Vescovo says.

"(Oct 9, 2020  10:36 AM CDT) Steve Montelongo says he was  in the right place at the right time  on Thursday when he saved the life of a man trapped in a partially submerged car. Though there was a crowd of at least 20 people already gathered around the irrigation canal in Modesto, Calif., when Montelongo's granddaughter spotted the car within it as her grandfather drove her to an appointment, he stopped and got out anyway.  I'm a hero, you know,  the 80-year-old jokingly told her, per the Modesto Bee. He wasn't lying. In 2003, the retired construction worker was awarded a medal from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission after saving two neighbors from a burning home. Then 62, he'd kicked down the front door and pulled one elderly neighbor to safety before returning for the woman's husband. He'd given the man his own shoes before helping him escape, which required knocking down a second door. Arriving at the scene on Thursday, Montelongo saw no attempts to help free the driver trapped behind the wheel.  So I walked into the canal—it was about 10 feet for me—and I managed to open the door,  he tells the Bee.  The water was rushing in, the car was starting to move,  he adds, per CBS Sacramento.  I grabbed [the driver's] shirt and I just pulled him out. But uh, that was it.  The 62-year-old driver was taken to the hospital to be treated for a medical emergency, which had caused him to crash into the canal, according to California Highway Patrol.  First responder, he can probably add to his resume,  rep Tom Olsen tells CBS of Montelongo.  A lot of people are in the right place at the right time, but very few actually did what Mr. Montelongo did.  Despite his earlier joke, Montelongo says he's no hero. But his grandson disagrees.

Come November, it expects to be in all 50 states. The party says its online primary won't begin for two more months, with the goal of having a candidate picked by late June.

An unidentified 25-year-old woman who was reported missing 10 years ago in California found her sister on Facebook and contacted her; police say that the victim then  eventually gained the courage  to contact them, reports KTLA-TV. Authorities have since arrested 41-year-old Isidro Garcia on suspicion of kidnapping for rape, lewd acts with a minor, and false imprisonment, says the Santa Ana Police Department. The woman says Garcia had been her mother's live-in boyfriend back in 2004 when he began sexually assaulting her at the age of 15. In August of that year, she says he drugged her and kidnapped her from her home, then locked her in a garage in Compton. After providing her with fake ID papers, he eventually convinced her that her family had stopped looking for her and that her mother and sisters might be deported if she tried to return. The pair moved frequently over the years and got jobs with a nighttime cleaning service, and police say Garcia assaulted her physically and sexually all the while.  Even with the opportunity to escape, after years of physical and mental abuse, the victim saw no way out of her situation and lived a life with Garcia under sustained physical and mental abuse,  say police. Garcia forced her to marry him in 2007, and she had a child with him in 2012, reports the LA Times.",Woman Held Captive 10 Years Goes to Police,Woman Held Captive ____ Years Goes to Police,10,Copy( 10 ),0

All seven firms—Boeing, Ford, General Motors, Chevron, Citigroup, Verizon, and JPMorgan Chase—are highly profitable, reporting more than $74 billion in combined pretax profits last year and paying their CEOs an average of $17.3 million, according to the report, which found that 29 of the 100 highest-earning chief executives in America earned more than their firms paid Uncle Sam. The billions in taxes that the firms are saving aren't being used to expand operations and hire workers, but to repurchase stock and finance corporate mergers, according to the report, which calls for the government to overhaul the  deeply flawed  corporate tax system and crack down on the use of tax havens. Out of the seven companies, all those that have commented on the report say they abide by all tax laws; one of them, Verizon, denies that its CEO makes more than it pays in federal taxes, reports Reuters.

According to the Denver Post, more than two-dozen survivors and parents of those killed sued the theater chain for not hiring armed guards, not having enough security cameras, and generally failing to protect theater-goers from shooter James Holmes. An Arapahoe County jury ruled against the victims last month, clearing the way for Cinemark to seek reimbursement for $699,187 in legal costs. A judge still has to approve that amount, and asking for the money may be a play on Cinemark's part to keep the victims from appealing the ruling. Another group of victims suing Cinemark in federal court had its case dismissed Friday by a judge who put the blame for the shooting squarely on Holmes, the Aurora Sentinel reports.

Bombs rocked a market and a restaurant in the capital; another bomb was attached to the bottom of a minibus.

Per the New York Times, Google will give up the brand to a restaurant review company called The Infatuation after purchasing it for $151 million in 2011. The sale was announced by The Infatuation on Monday. A purchase price was not disclosed.  We’re thrilled by this opportunity to acquire such a pioneering and trusted restaurant guide as Zagat,  said Chris Stang, The Infatuation’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer.  Iconic brands don’t become available very often, and Zagat is about as iconic as it gets.  Since its founding by Tim and Nina Zagat in 1979 as a compilation of opinions about New York City restaurants by their own friends, Zagat has grown to become synonymous with restaurant reviews in cities across America and beyond. Now, Zagat will be in the hands of a 9-year-old company geared toward a Millenial audience whose brand loyalties have been forged in the digital age. Instead of looking to merge one brand into the other, The Infatuation says it plans to keep the brands distinct.  The Infatuation will retain its editorial-first focus,  reads The Infatuation's press release.

The stampede happened at the Thomas Restobar in Lima, where about 120 people had gathered for a party on Saturday night, the Interior Ministry said. People tried to escape through the only door of the second-floor disco, trampling one another and becoming trapped in the confined space, according to authorities. After the stampede, police had to force open the door. Franco Asensios, one of those who attended the party, told local radio RPP that the police raid started at 9pm and that authorities told the party-goers to let the women exit first.

She alerted authorities when she couldn't find him on her own. Police—who searched with helicopters, drones, and K9 units—didn't even need to ask for volunteers, per the Antigo Times.

The Los Angeles Times set out to see if that's really the case these days. In what it calls a  small but revealing  test of the service's current reliability, it tracked 100 letters mailed from 20 Los Angeles County post offices between Aug. 21 and 24 (the period over which Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before Congress) to California destinations as well as Austin, Atlanta, and Washington. The upshot: About half ended up being delayed.  Postal performance in the summer of 2020 is spotty at best, dismal at worst,  concludes the paper, which lays the blame not in one place but outlines  multiple choke points [that] can slow a letter’s journey.  The USPS endeavors to have letters sent to the aforementioned out-of-state destinations arrive in three business days, says Gaare Davis, the head of the American Postal Workers Union, California. The paper describes one letter reaching Austin in 11 days; another in 8. In the case of three letters sent to Washington, it took them each three days to get from the processing center to the house—just one mile away. Of the letters that were to arrive within two business days, 75% managed to get there in that window. That's a big drop from the 92.4% on-time delivery rate the USPS recorded in Q2, per the paper. Davis called the findings  unacceptable.  A rep for the USPS was less ruffled, saying the agency saw improved performance throughout August and that it is still working to  identify and address some ongoing service issues in certain areas.","Newspaper Mails 100 Letters, Sees What Happens","Newspaper Mails ____ Letters, Sees What Happens",100,Copy( 100 ),0

It looks like there are four possibilities: no one, Jayme herself, the woman she approached asking for help, or the couple who then called 911. The FBI in late October ponied up $25,000 for anyone providing information leading to the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl's rescue, and the Jennie-O Turkey Store, which employed her parents, matched that amount.

And though congressional Democrats and the White House are urging an extension, it's not looking likely, the New York Times reports. With Congress adjourning in two weeks, it remains unable to agree on a budget, and negotiators are focused on sequestration cuts. A deal to adjust or replace those cuts wouldn't be likely to include a jobless benefit extension, the Times notes. Renewal of the program through 2014 would add some $25 billion to the $250 billion it has cost so far. But without an extension, a total of 4.8 million could lose benefits by the end of next year, says top White House economic adviser Gene Sperling:  Historically, there has not been a time where the unemployment rate has been this high where you have not extended it.  Currently, some 4.1 million Americans have been unemployed for at least six months, reports the Washington Post, which has details of the program.

The Race for the Top program, part of the stimulus package, will award grants to states that meet these goals, and shut out those that don't, the Washington Post reports. The cash isn't a big share of the $100 billion provided for schools in the stimulus package, but the fund dwarfs the amount education secretaries before Arne Duncan had to spend on their own priorities.

The Trumps caused a stir over the weekend at the G20 summit in Germany when Ivanka took her father's seat at a formal meeting. Critics called it improper, but Trump disagrees.  When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat,  he tweeted.  Very standard. Angela M agrees!  The latter refers to German leader Angela Merkel, who told reporters asking about the seat switch that Ivanka  was part and parcel of the American delegation, so that is something that other delegations also do,  per the Hill. President Trump also accuses the media of a hypothetical double-standard.  If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!  he tweeted. The seat switch, during a meeting of world leaders on Africa, left Ivanka between Britain's Theresa May and China's Xi Jinping, notes the Washington Post. One of the prominent critics of the move was former NATO ambassador Nicholas Burns, who has served under presidents of both parties. Seat switches may be common, he said, but he thought it should have been the secretary of state filling in.

Nor did Jamie Madley envision Scullion reaching adulthood until his 18th birthday, when he fulfilled his dream of flying a plane. She was only trying to protect herself: At just four months old, Scullion was diagnosed with the rapid aging condition progeria, better known as  Benjamin Button disease,  and predicted to live only until his 13th birthday, though  I just don't think about all of that,  he said in 2014.

He died later that day at a hospital, exactly 20 years after his initial diagnosis, as the second-oldest progeria patient in the world, reports Global News. Scullion—who met NSYNC as a 4-year-old—suffered two strokes as a child and more recently had a heart attack. He also battled arthritis and, like many progeria patients, had a low body weight, though he credited his involvement in a clinical trial for the drug lonafarnib with helping him maintain an appetite. Madley said the drug also reversed the hardening of his arteries, per CTV News.  He lived his life to the fullest and he loved every minute,  she says.

The ultra-Orthodox woman gave birth to a healthy 5.9-pound baby boy this week, reports the Jerusalem Post. Haya Shahar did so thanks to IVF treatment she had outside the country, likely Russia, because Israel forbids the procedure for women older than 54.  We do not recommend this,  says Dr. Tal Biron of Kfar Saba hospital. Nevertheless, he added that the baby is  very cute.  Shahar's husband is 67, and they'd been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby throughout their 46-year marriage. The Post notes the sperm was either donated or bought, but the hospital won't specify; Haaretz says the couple used a donor egg. While the delivery (by C-section) makes Shahar the oldest woman to give birth in Israel, it's not a world record. Among the older verified births are one in Spain and another in Romania, both with women who delivered at age 66 after IVF treatments, notes the Mommy Files blog at the San Francisco Chronicle. The oldest woman on record to conceive naturally is a woman in the UK who gave birth at 59, it adds. Shahar and her husband credit a rabbi's blessing for their new son.

What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade.  The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,  the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from  consular officers  who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The  embassy,  only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a  dreadful experience,  per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish.

But other sources say the idea was LaPierre's, and that it was McQueen who scuttled the deal after learning its terms; per the source, LaPierre wanted to also become a member of the tony golf club beside the property, which led McQueen to question whether LaPierre's motivation was really security-based.

But unless you make a detour to waters above the deepest spot in the ocean, you might never hear it. Initially stumped by the  Western Pacific Biotwang —recorded above the deepest known part of Earth's oceans, the Mariana Trench—scientists now believe the noise comes from a species of baleen whale called minke whales. Minke whales are found in the area, but little is known about their vocalizations as the species  doesn't spend much time at the surface, has an inconspicuous blow, and often lives in areas where high seas make sighting difficult,  researcher Sharon Nieukirk tells Live Science. However, it is known that minke whales  call frequently,  says Nieukirk, and acoustic robots recorded the Western Pacific Biotwang on several occasions between the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015.  It's very distinct, with all these crazy parts,  Nieukirk says in a statement.  The low-frequency moaning part is typical of baleen whales, and it's that kind of twangy sound that makes it really unique.  If the sound is confirmed to come from a baleen whale, it would be significant as identifying a new baleen-whale call is a rare occurrence. It's unclear what the call might mean—a mating call would only be heard seasonally—but researchers plan to collect biopsy samples to learn more, reports the Christian Science Monitor.

Any international nongovermental groups wanting US financial assistance will now have to sign off on the  Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance  mandate, per NBC News. The State Department says any funds that are taken away from one group will be redistributed to others that agree to the terms, keeping the foreign aid level relatively the same. The expanded mandate means groups who want US money must not  promote abortion as a method of family planning.  The gag rule ups the amount being affected from between $520 million and $600 million under former President George W. Bush to about $8.8 billion, with public health advocates noting funding will be severed in places that need it most, such as West Africa.  Whole communities could be cut off,  one advocate tells the Times. In a tweet Monday, National Right to Life applauded the move  to apply pro-life conditions to a broad range of health-related US foreign aid.  But in a statement, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says Trump's  dangerous obsession  against reproductive rights will now have  severe consequences for millions of vulnerable women and children.

"(Oct 20, 2013  6:04 AM CDT) A San Francisco Bay Area commuter train returning from routine maintenance struck and killed two workers who were inspecting the tracks yesterday afternoon—an accident that comes amid a strike that has shut the Bay Area Rapid Transit system down for the past few days. The four-car train was being run in automatic mode under computer control at the time of the accident, BART's Assistant General Manager Paul Oversier said. There were several people aboard the train, Oversier said, but he would not say who was operating the train. In an earlier statement, BART said only that the person was an experienced operator. One system employee and one contractor were killed in the accident shortly before 2pm. The train had been at a yard where workers had been cleaning off graffiti, BART officials said. Officials from the unions representing BART's train operators and some of the system's other workers have warned of the danger that could come with allowing managers to operate trains as BART had planned to do in case of a strike. One of the unions on strike, Amalgamated Transit Union 1555, announced that its 900 workers would not be picketing today out of respect for the victims and their families. BART officials wouldn't address questions on the union's warnings about train safety during a walkout.  The labor issues are not in the forefront of our mind,  Oversier said.  We've just lost two people in the BART family.

"(Aug 3, 2016  3:27 AM CDT)  Smart diplomacy —or dollar diplomacy? The US government quietly delivered the equivalent of $400 million in cash to Iran on Jan. 16 this year, the same day that Tehran released four detained American citizens, sources including US officials tell the Wall Street Journal. The cash, which was sent in currencies including Swiss francs because of a US ban on doing business with Iran in dollars, was part of a $1.7 billion agreement Washington reached with Tehran over an Iranian-US arms deal made just before the revolution that brought the Ayatollah Khomeini to power in 1979. President Obama didn't disclose the payment when discussing either the prisoner release or the arms deal settlement. Administration officials say the timing of the payment was a complete coincidence—and since the failed 1979 arms deal was headed to an international court in the Hague, the settlement probably saved American taxpayers billions of dollars.  Not only were the two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of the Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years,  says State Department spokesman John Kirby. Some of the Journal's sources, however, say Iranian negotiators demanded the cash delivery as part of the prisoner exchange—and Iranian officials openly boasted about the US having bowed to pressure.

"(May 15, 2015  1:56 AM CDT) BB King, whose scorching guitar licks and heartfelt vocals made him the idol of generations of musicians and fans while earning him the nickname  King of the Blues,  died late last night at home in Las Vegas. He was 89. His attorney tells the AP that King died peacefully in his sleep. Although he had continued to perform well into his 80s, the 15-time Grammy winner suffered from diabetes and had been in declining health during the past year. He collapsed during a concert in Chicago last October, later blaming dehydration and exhaustion. For most of a career spanning nearly 70 years and more than 50 albums, King was not only the undisputed king of the blues, but a mentor to scores of guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Otis Rush, Jimi Hendrix, and Keith Richards. A preacher uncle taught him to play, and he honed his technique in abject poverty in the Mississippi Delta, the birthplace of the blues.  I've always tried to defend the idea that the blues doesn't have to be sung by a person who comes from Mississippi, as I did,  he said in 1988.  People all over the world have problems. And as long as people have problems, the blues can never die.  Still, the Delta's influence was undeniable. King began picking cotton on tenant farms around Indianola, Miss., before he was a teenager and was still working off sharecropping debts after he got out of the Army during World War II.  He goes back far enough to remember the sound of field hollers and the cornerstone blues figures, like Charley Patton and Robert Johnson,  ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons once told Rolling Stone.",The Thrill Is Gone: BB King Dead at 89,The Thrill Is Gone: BB King Dead at ____,89,Copy( 89 ),0

There’s a fear that getting older means many years of living in bad shape with a rather gloomy outlook,  the lead researcher tells Bloomberg.

But  almost  might be a little too generous. A team led by Gergely Balazs of Eotvos Lorand University studied a group of olms found in Bosnia and Herzegovina over an eight-year period and discovered one didn't move at all—for 2,569 days. That's seven years. Their paper published in the Journal of Zoology is titled  Extreme Site Fidelity,  an appropriate description of their finding that, in general, each individual olm clocks less than about 32 feet of movement over a decade. The Independent reports the white salamanders have little cause to move: They're blind, live in darkness, can go years without eating, and have no predators to avoid. The only act that requires movement is mating, which happens every 12.5 years on average for females.  Most studies carried out on the species to date are based on laboratory studies,  the researchers write,  resulting in a severe lack of ecological data from natural populations studied in their original habitat.  They got that data—but not a ton of insight.  We cannot present any strong argument about the benefits of being sedentary or the costs/risks of moving over larger areas ... We can only speculate that animals feeding on a very low food supply ... reproducing sporadically ... and living for a century are very energy cautious and limit their movements to the minimum.","There's a Creature That Didn't Move for 2,569 Days",There's a Creature That Didn't Move for ____ Days,"2,569","Copy( 2,569 )",0

The report exonerated Brown on one thing: It found that he didn't seem to be watching a movie when the crash happened, as some reports had suggested.  Unequivocally false,  says the family lawyer, saying the movie theory should be laid to rest. At the time of the accident, Tesla released a statement saying neither the autopilot system nor Brown  noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.  According to the report, the truck should have been visible to Brown for at least seven seconds, but the driver  took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision.  Less than two minutes before the accident, Brown had set the cruise control to 74 mph, nine miles per hour over the speed limit. Since the accident, Tesla has upgraded its Autopilot feature, which will now shut down if a driver fails to respond to audible warnings.

A 13-year-old Russian, Daniil Korotkikh, was walking with his parents on a beach when he saw something glittering in the sand.  It looked interesting,  Korotkikh said.  It looked like a German beer bottle with a ceramic plug, and there was a message inside.  His father translated the German, which read:  My name is Frank, and I'm five years old. My dad and I are traveling on a ship to Denmark. If you find this letter, please write back to me, and I will write back to you.  The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town of Coesfeld. The boy in the letter, Frank Uesbeck, is now 29. His parents still live at the letter's address.  At first I didn't believe it,  Uesbeck said. In fact, he barely remembered the trip at all; his father actually wrote the letter. But Daniil will  definitely get another letter from me,  the 29-year-old said.

Kierah LaGrave was arrested Thursday in Plattsburgh, New York, on second-degree strangulation charges after the alleged victim reported the assault on Oct. 20. Police say the 22-year-old admitted to choking the bouncer into unconsciousness at Five1Eight nightclub but did it because he had grabbed her, per the Press Republican. But surveillance video suggests that the real perpetrator was a friend of Lagrave's. LaGrave, who also works at the club, can be seen on video talking to a female friend at the bar before turning to dance—which is when her friend playfully slapped LaGrave's behind, per the New York Post. The 125-pound LaGrave then spotted the bouncer walking by and put him in a chokehold until he fell to the floor unconscious. Law And Crime notes that LaGrave's friend can be seen glancing at the assault and tossing her hair, then walking over when the bouncer was about to fall over. Released on her own recognizance, LaGrave is slated to return to court Nov. 20.",125-Pound Woman Chokes Out Bouncer by Mistake: Cops,____-Pound Woman Chokes Out Bouncer by Mistake: Cops,125,Copy( 125 ),0

They say a NATO airstrike mistakenly hit rebel vehicles near the city of Brega, killing at least 13 anti-Gadhafi fighters, reports Reuters. A rebel spokesman called it  regrettable  but said the airstrikes must continue.  You have to look at the big picture. Mistakes will happen. We are trying to get rid of Gadhafi and there will be casualties, although of course it does not make us happy.  NATO says it's investigating. It's unclear what happened, but the BBC says a rebel may have triggered the attack by firing an anti-aircraft gun in celebration. Another fighter gives a slightly different take to Reuters:  Some of Gadhafi's forces sneaked in among the rebels and fired anti-aircraft guns in the air. After that the NATO forces came and bombed them.

"(Oct 16, 2017  7:23 AM CDT) As allegations pile up against Harvey Weinstein, the New York Times reports on a case that nearly exposed the producer's alleged serial sexual harassment two years ago. A police sting caught Weinstein admitting on tape that he grabbed an Italian model's breasts. But after a stable of well-connected Weinstein lawyers and handlers mobilized to discredit Ambra Battilana, 22, the case was dropped within two weeks in April 2015. Prosecutors, including current New York City DA Cyrus Vance, decided Battilana wasn't a credible witness because she disavowed statements she made in Italy related to a sex harassment claim, as well as a sex party thrown by former PM Silvio Berlusconi. Weinstein's lawyers said he touched Battilana's breasts to determine if they were real for a lingerie ad. Prosecutors decided the allegations weren't strong enough. The police disagree.  We brought them a very good case,  a senior NYPD official tells the Times. After the case was dropped, the Times says  Weinstein silenced Ms. Battilana with a substantial payment,  though she says she then watched her fashion career fizzle. Meanwhile, the NYPD said on Sunday they were probing new allegations against Weinstein. And in London, cops said a third accuser stepped forward accusing Weinstein, 65, of sexually assaulting her three times between 2010 and 2015, the Telegraph reports.

But everyone missed the larger point: Melissa King was just 18 when she supposedly filmed it, writes Charles Lane in the Washington Post.  Why is it even legal to cast an 18-year-old in a sexually explicit movie?  he wonders. Eighteen might be the age at which you can vote, but certainly  having sex with a stranger for money and on camera belongs on the short list of risky behaviors that one can’t legally engage in before age 21,  like drinking, gambling, working as a stripper, or buying a gun. Congress set the minimum age to participate in porn at 18 in 1984, back when it took a lot more time, effort, and money to make a porn film. These days, anyone can film a sex act on a cellphone camera and distribute it on social media.  Mistakes like King’s are much easier to make but much harder to erase,  Lane writes.

"(Sep 27, 2017  10:50 AM CDT) Encountering a foot-and-a-half-long rat might be nightmarish for some, but for Tyrone Lavery, it heralded a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. Back in 2010, the mammalogist was exploring the Solomon Islands when he heard locals describe  vika,  a giant tree-dwelling rat with teeth powerful enough to break open coconuts. Reports of such a rat had circulated for decades. But though he searched for years, Lavery only managed to find some rather large rat poop, reports the Guardian. In 2016, however, Lavery was able to examine a rat that had died after falling from a tree downed by loggers and knew immediately his quest for  vika  was over. Uromys vika, as it has now been named, is the first new rat species discovered in the Solomon Islands in 80 years. At 18 inches long and 2.2 pounds, the specimen within the family of mosaic-tailed rats is about four times the size of a common rat. It's  pretty spectacular,  says Lavery, per a release. And though  it was just so hard to find,  the researcher is happy his persistence paid off.  If we hadn't discovered it now, it might never have gotten discovered  due to the logging of the rainforest canopy the rat inhabits through use of its scaly tail and clawed back feet, Lavery says, per National Geographic. He also describes the rat's ability to chew holes in tree nuts. Given that Lavery believes the species' total habitat is 31 square miles, his paper in the Journal of Mammalogy requests that the rat be immediately classified as critically endangered.

December 3rd, 2015 is not the day Scott Weiland died,  Mary Forsberg Weiland writes on behalf of herself, 15-year-old Noah, and 13-year-old Lucy, the two children she had with the ex-Stone Temple Pilots frontman.  It is the official day the public will use to mourn him, and it was the last day he could be propped up in front of a microphone for the financial benefit or enjoyment of others. … The truth is, like so many other kids, [Noah and Lucy] lost their father years ago. What they truly lost on December 3rd was hope.  She adds that  this is the final step in our long goodbye to Scott  and that  maybe these last few years of separation were his parting gift to us—the only way he could think to soften what he knew would one day crush us deep into our souls.  Forsberg delves more into those years of separation, noting that although she doesn't want to  downplay Scott's amazing talent,  he was an absentee father and  once sweet Catholic boy  who went atheist and suffered from  multiple illnesses.   You might [say] ... 'We read that he loved spending time with his children and that he'd been drug-free for years!'  she writes.

"(Jan 2, 2019  4:32 PM) When it comes to people killed by human hands, it's likely  the deadliest three months in human history,  as USA Today puts it. That would be August through October 1942, according to a new peer-reviewed study. Researchers used detailed train transportation records to estimate 1.47 million Jews were murdered over the roughly 100-day period. That's about 25% of all victims of the six-year World War II. In the study published in Science Advances, the researchers write that Operation Reinhard, which ran from 1942 to 1943 with the intention of killing all the Jews in German-occupied Poland,  was the largest single murder campaign of the Holocaust,  with 1.7 million victims, chiefly killed at the Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka death camps. But  the tempo, kill rates, and spatial dynamics of these events were poorly documented.  Lead author and mathematical biologist Lewi Stone of Tel Aviv University and RMIT University found that during the three months in question, there were 480 train trips to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, which, unlike Auschwitz, did not have a forced-labor element and whose sole purpose was murder. Using surviving historical records and details from postwar trials, they estimated the number of Jews on each transport to arrive at their total.  That the massacre occurred in such a short timeframe ... ensured the Jewish people did not have a chance,  Stone tells Newsweek. The study provides a detailed comparison between this kill rate and that of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, which has been upheld as the 20th century's  most intense  genocide; an estimated 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered over 100 days. Per Stone's data, the Nazi kill rate was 83% higher.  It's a juxtaposition that serves to highlight the extremity of the Nazis' crimes, but which comes at the risk of diverting focus from the fact that genocide is deeply evil regardless of scale,  observes Popular Mechanics.

And while Megna, who's been disabled since 2011, has applied for compensation cash from the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act of 2010, there's a complication: Kidney disease isn't one of the recognized illnesses covered by the fund. That means the divorced dad of three isn't eligible for any money—even though Mary Ann McLaughlin, a Mount Sinai Medical Center researcher who petitioned the fund two years ago to add the disease based on initial research, has examined Megna's records and believes the WTC toxins  may more likely than not  be tied to his sickness. However, a rep for the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which runs the program, says a disease can be added to the list—and compensation issued—only after  published, peer-reviewed epidemiologic evidence  shows  substantial support  for a direct link between the WTC fallout and the disease. Megna will have to hold tight, per the rep, who says once McLaughlin publishes her study, kidney disease eligibility will be considered. But that's time Megna—$120,000 behind on his mortgage and anticipating dialysis down the road (his kidneys are now functioning at 45%, per the Star-Ledger)—says he doesn't have.

Wade arrives with surveys showing US views on abortion largely unchanged over the past 15 years and with abortions at their lowest level since the ruling, CNN reports. As cases to alter current restrictions wind through the courts, polls show that about 36% of Americans think abortion should almost always be legal, 40% say it's OK in limited circumstances, and 22% say it should be illegal.

"(Nov 7, 2019  11:34 AM) A Los Angeles firefighter racked up an eye-popping amount of overtime pay last fiscal year, per an audit released Wednesday: $360,010. In fact, the audit by City Controller Ron Galperin reveals, more than 90% of sworn police and fire employees in the city got overtime (an average of $27,737). Some standouts: A traffic officer made $174,348 in overtime pay, a senior inspector at the Building and Safety Department made $152,163, and 18 Los Angeles Fire Department employees made more than $200,000. Base pay for city firefighters is $65,000 to $91,000. The  departments properly approved and substantiated the majority of sworn and civilian overtime,  but  there is clearly a need for better oversight and regulation,  Galperin wrote in a letter accompanying the audit, which has been sent to the mayor, city attorney, and City Council. Considering the year of wildfires California's had, the fact that much of the OT went to firefighters is earning attention. Per USA Today, Galperin says overtime is a  critical tool  in protecting communities from not just fire but also crime and other emergencies.  We see its importance firsthand each time the city deploys firefighters around the clock to combat wildfires, like the catastrophic Getty and Woolsey fires,  he says. Per the Los Angeles Times, an LAFD rep notes overtime is an integral part of its  constant staffing  model, adding that state and federal governments  almost entirely  reimburse the department for its wildfire efforts. The audit notes that just 40% of the city's general employees got overtime pay during the same time period, earning an average of $7,528.

And an alleged witch doctor charged in the deaths. Police say Muhammad Raheesh Isoof, 62, lived next to Nirmal Kumar, 63, his wife Usha Devi, 54, for years in Fiji before Isoof and his wife moved to New Zealand. But they returned to Fiji last month for a visit, and allegedly met up with Kumar and Devi before their deaths. Found dead alongside them were their daughter Nileshni Kajal, 34, and her daughters Sana, 11, and Samara, 8. The baby found alive is Kajal's niece. Police say the victims had no visible injuries and one was found with an empty bottle of soda that had no label on it; postmortem exams have since linked all the deaths to a toxic substance, but more testing is being done, News.com.au reports. Kumar's brother says Isoof, known locally as a healer with  special abilities,  had been treating Devi for abdominal pains for years; a family friend tells Stuff.co.nz,  They've performed rituals together at the beach and elsewhere. This is not the first time they've been out together.  Investigators say both Kumar and Devi had a fascination with the occult and a long history with Isoof. Kajal's estranged husband, the father of Sana and Samara, supports that story and says Kumar and Devi were obsessed with  witchcraft.  As for the baby, Sumaira, one of the witnesses who saw her after she was first found says the fact that she could not yet walk likely saved her life and kept her from falling off the cliff.

"(Feb 16, 2017  12:29 PM) Colorado's beetle-infested forests are peppered with an estimated 834 million standing dead trees that threaten to worsen wildfires and degrade vital water supplies that flow from mountains, officials say. Roughly one in every 14, or about 7%, standing trees in the state's forests is dead, with the total up 30% in seven years, though officials are working to remove them, the State Forest Service said Wednesday in an annual report, per the AP.  Is it something to be alarmed about? Of course it is,  State Forester Mike Lester says, noting infestations of mountain pine beetles and spruce beetles are the main cause of the die-off. Beetles are native to the state but have caused far more damage than normal over the past 20 years, attacking more than 20% of total forested land. Lester and others blame a combination of warmer weather that allows beetles to survive the winter and trees left more vulnerable because of age and stress from severe droughts in the past. Although the pine beetle epidemic has subsided, spruce beetles are still spreading. The course of that outbreak will determine whether the tree die-off worsens or levels off, Lester says. Standing and fallen trees killed by beetles can make wildfires burn longer and in some cases hotter. Wildfires, in turn, threaten to worsen erosion, which can load rain and melting snow with silt, change the timing of that spring runoff, and reduce the capacity of reservoirs when the sediment settles to the bottom, disrupting water supplies for cities, the report says.",7% of Trees in Colo.

Franklin, a former garbage collector and police garage attendant, would kill his victims and leave them partially clothed or naked in alleys and dumpsters near his home, according to CNN. He was tied to killings in 2010 using new DNA technology. The AP reports a cop posing as a busboy got Franklin's DNA off pizza crusts and napkins following a birthday celebration. It matched saliva found on the breasts of many of the victims. More than 60 witnesses testified during the three-month trial.

"(Dec 22, 2015  1:25 PM) Two Michigan youngsters are lucky they weren't shot at or killed in a car wreck after the older child, a 13-year-old boy, allegedly led police on a high-speed chase Saturday night, the Detroit Free Press reports. The Macomb County Sheriff's Dispatch Center started taking in reports of a Nissan Altima driving in an erratic manner in Clinton Township, and a sheriff's deputy came across the car stopped at a traffic light. In the pursuing deputy's dashcam video released Monday by the Macomb County Sheriff's Office, the police car can be seen trailing the Altima for a short time before the deputy pulls the Altima over—only for the Altima to speed away while the officer is getting ready to approach the vehicle. The deputy, who had no clue how old the driver really was, chases the speeding Altima for a time through traffic, until the teen driver loses control, swerves across the road, and comes to a stop in a lane of oncoming traffic on the other side of the parkway. Both the driver and a passenger dash from the car, and the deputy informs the dispatcher,  They're both getting out and running  and starts driving behind them in pursuit. That's when he makes a startling discovery.  It's a little kid,  he tells the dispatcher. Both children—the driver and his 8-year-old sister—were nabbed, uninjured.  The deputy that was pursuing them did not expect to see a 13-year-old and an 8-year-old get out of a car and run away from the police,  the sheriff tells CBS Detroit. Investigators determined the kids had waited for their dad to doze off, then took his girlfriend's car for a joyride, the station notes. The 13-year-old was charged with unlawful driving away, fleeing and eluding, and resisting and obstructing police and will appear at a juvenile detention hearing Monday, per the Free Press; his little sister was released to her mom, per CBS.

And probably a few thousand on top of that,  asserted Anders Fogh Rasmussen.  This is our fight together.  The problem, says the Washington Post, is that because of semantics and funky counting, the goal may be met on paper but not necessarily on the ground. For starters, NATO is counting 1,500 European troops already sent to Afghanistan for last summer's election. It's also not accounting for troops scheduled to leave, such as the 2,100 from the Netherlands who return home in August.

"(Jan 6, 2016  2:23 PM) It's starting to seem like America is an expensive place to get a disease. Bloomberg reports sofosbuvir—a Hepatitis C  miracle cure —that retails for $1,000 per pill in the US is currently going for $4.29 in India, and that price is continuing to drop. Like other pharmaceutical companies, Gilead Sciences is making generic versions of its drug available in developing countries. More than a dozen generic versions of sofosbuvir, which can get rid of Hepatitis C in just three months, are currently being sold by multiple companies in India. And those companies are constantly lowering prices to gain a bigger market share.  If one agrees to it, the others will also have to,  an Indian gastroenterologist tells Bloomberg.  It’s a race where one cannot say no—because then they’re going to lose the business.  These cheap, generic versions of sofosbuvir are great for India, where at least 12 million people—and up to 50% of the population in some areas—have Hepatitis C, Bloomberg reports. But in the US, the steep price—nearly $95,000 for a 12-week course—is limiting access, according to aidsmap.com. A recent study found almost 25% of people with chronic Hepatitis C have their initial requests for sofosbuvir denied by insurance companies. That number lowers to less than 10% after appeals—but appeals take time away from treatment. Insurance companies often require patients to have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis before they agree to take on the cost of sofosbuvir. Bloomberg reports Medicaid is also limiting access to sofosbuvir.

The missing included a 7-year-old boy and another child believed to be around the same age, as well as a man, the AP reports. Migrants often try to cross the river, mostly in poorly constructed rafts with no safety gear, and the water can be deceptively high and fast-moving. According to one official, Border Patrol agents encountered a man at about 9:45pm Wednesday evening near Del Rio, Texas. He told them a raft carrying nine people had overturned and his baby son and nephew had been swept away along the other child and man. The agents heard the man's wife and an older son screaming in the darkness and the two were pulled from the muddy water alive, according to a preliminary report of the incident from the official. Another man and his 13-year-old child were rescued nearby, the official said. The children were hospitalized for observation.

After the owner of a farm in Leochel-Cushnie, Aberdeenshire, contacted authorities about a stone circle on his property, archaeologists investigated the site and concluded that it was an authentic—if unusually small—monument that was probably thousands of years old, the Guardian reports. They were later contacted by the farm's previous owner, who told them it was a replica he had built in the 1990s. The monument was a  recumbent  stone circle, with a monolith on its side, a type of ancient stone circle found only in the Aberdeenshire area and the southwest of Ireland. Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said that while the truth is disappointing, the monument is in a  fantastic location  and he hopes people continue to enjoy it, the BBC reports.  It is obviously disappointing to learn of this development, but it also adds an interesting element to its story,  he says.  That it so closely copies a regional monument type shows the local knowledge, appreciation, and engagement with the archaeology of the region by the local community.

City Council President Herb Wesson's office confirmed the deal Monday. Spokeswoman Caolinn Mejza says the pact is expected to be reviewed by the council later this week. The agreement to be formally announced later Monday follows a vote earlier this month by the International Olympic Committee to seek a deal to award the 2024 and 2028 Games. LA and Paris were the last two bids remaining after a tumultuous process that exposed the unwillingness of cities to bear the financial burden of hosting an event that has become synonymous with cost overruns. Paris is now the only city left to host the 2024 Games. CNN notes this will be the first Summer Olympics held in the US since Atlanta 1996. LA was not even the first American entrant in the 2024 contest. Boston withdrew two years ago as public support for its bid collapsed over concerns about use of taxpayer cash. The US bid switched from the east to the West Coast as LA entered the race. But the same apprehensions that spooked politicians and the local population in Boston soon became evident in Europe where three cities pulled out. With two powerful cities left vying for 2024, IOC President Thomas Bach realized France or the US could be deterred from going through another contest for 2028 if they lost. Bach floated the idea in December of making revisions to the bidding process to prevent it producing  too many losers,  building support that led to LA and Paris being able to figure out themselves how to share the 2024 and 2028 Games. The dual award of the games relieves the IOC of having to test the global interest in hosting the Summer Olympics for several years until the 2032 Games are up for grabs.",Los Angeles Reaches Deal to Host 2028 Olympics,Los Angeles Reaches Deal to Host ____ Olympics,2028,Copy( 2028 ),0

Hays County officials say 11 people remain missing in the area, including eight people who were in a vacation home that was swept away and slammed into a bridge downstream early Sunday. KVUE talked to the sister of Laura McComb, who was in the home along with her husband and two kids, Andrew, 6, and Leighton, 4. Shortly after midnight,  [Laura] called me, she said 'I'm in a house. I'm floating down the river. Tell Mom and Dad I love you and pray,'  says Julie Shields. Husband Jonathan McComb was found alive on a river bank miles from the home; he suffered a broken rib and sternum and a collapsed lung. Shields says he was holding hands with his family when the house, which sat atop stilts,  slammed into a bridge and ... broke in two,  separating them.  When you hit a bridge moving at 35 to 40mph on the river, it's equivalent to a 70mph head-on  collision, Hays County Judge Bert Cobb tells the AP. A heart-wrenching quote from Shields:  I think recognizing ... what's happening with the weather, we all know and we have accepted that they're gone.  Jonathan appears to be the only one of the nine vacationing in the home to have survived.

Curtis Jackson III, who owns a home in Farmington, Conn., filed for Chapter 11 protection in US District Court in Hartford today. The filing lists both his assets and liabilities as between $10 million and $50 million. It comes after a New York jury on Friday ordered Jackson to pay $5 million to Lastonia Leviston, who said he acquired a sex tape she made with her boyfriend, added himself as a crude commentator, and posted it online without her permission. (Forbes calls Jackson's filing  suspiciously timed.  Wearing a wig and calling himself Pimpin' Curly in the video, Jackson made explicit remarks about Leviston and taunted her former boyfriend and his rap rival, Rick Ross, the AP reports. Jackson got the 2008 tape from the man in the video, Leviston's boyfriend at the time. The rapper and his lawyers say Jackson didn't actually post the video but that Leviston's then-boyfriend said she wouldn't mind if he did, and he thought that would suffice.

She alleges the college falsified its post-graduate employment statistics, reports 760 KFMB-AM. The former student—who graduated with honors and passed the bar on her first try—says she attended the school because of its reported 70% post-grad employment rate. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff—who works as a freelance document reviewer—has been  unable to secure a full-time job as an attorney that pays more than non-legal jobs available to her,  and she would  not have attended TJSL and incurred more than $150,000 in school loans if she knew the truth about her job prospects upon graduation.  The school denies the claim of false advertising, and a dean says it isn't the duty of the college to find jobs for graduates.

In recent days, not one but two dogs have survived enormous drops, one from a 150-foot-high cliff and another from the 15th story of a building. Sandy, a 3-year-old yellow Lab, was somehow spooked during a walk in the Columbia Gorge in Oregon on Christmas. She ripped her leash and ran, falling down the cliff, the AP reports. When owner David Schelske made his way to the bottom, he spotted her some 70 feet above him on a ledge. Thank goodness for John Thoeni, a volunteer with the Humane Society, who rappelled to the ledge with help from a crew of eight people. When he arrived, he attached a rescue harness to Sandy and brought her to safety. Sam, a 13-year-old Boston terrier, can't see very well, and when he was home alone, he fell off a balcony belonging to one of Sacramento's tallest buildings. The good news: He landed in a hot tub.  He actually went down all 15 stories into the hot tub,  says his owner, Bill McCourt. It was all caught on surveillance video.  The dog, when he goes into hot tub, he hits it almost dead center and then he starts swimming immediately, instinctually, in the hot tub to try to find his way out,  which he was able to do, McCourt says. Sam has a fractured pelvis and ribs, but he's due to come home from the hospital soon, vets tell CBS Sacramento.

The bombings in Baghdad and a town south of the capital were the latest attacks by suspected Sunni insurgents trying to re-ignite sectarian violence and undermine the Shiite-led government. The bombings targeted an outdoor pet market in Baghdad's northern Kazimyah neighborhood and a vegetable market in the Shiite town of Shomali in Hillah province. In Baghdad, the first car bomb exploded around mid-morning at the entrance to the Kazimyah market, police said. When panicked shoppers tried to flee the area, a second parked car exploded a few yards away, according to the officers, who said at least 17 people were killed and 45 were wounded. About an hour later, two car bombs exploded simultaneously at the Shomali market, killing at least 14 people and wounding 26, police said.

According to ABC News, the FBI has accounted for most of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik's day between the shooting around 11am and their deaths at the hands of police around 3pm. But despite 500 or so interviews, investigators haven't been able to place either of the shooters between 12:59pm and 1:17pm, the Press Enterprise reports.

"(Jun 3, 2019  8:23 AM CDT) Lots of people keep an eye on their fitness trackers as they go about the common mission of getting 10,000 steps daily. A new study, however, suggests that specific goal isn't as important as you might think. Researchers found that benefits in regard to longevity began in earnest at about 4,400 steps daily and leveled off at 7,500, at least among older women, reports NPR. The intensity of those steps didn't seem to matter. The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 17,000 women with a mean age of 72, beginning in 2011. The large study sample, combined with the long follow-up of eight years in some cases, gives the study credibility, writes Nina Shapiro at Forbes. The upshot is that the figure of 10,000 appears to be based more on marketing than science.  I’m not saying don’t get 10,000 steps,  lead researcher I-Min Lee of Harvard's TH Chan School of Public Health tells the Atlantic.  If you can get 10,000 steps, more power to you. But if you’re someone who’s sedentary, even a very modest increase brings you significant health benefits.  A University of Iowa researcher not involved with the study amplifies the latter point.  To me, this study suggests there's more benefit to light activity than we were previously thinking there might be,  Kathleen Janz tells NPR. The study was observational, meaning it didn't definitively link the walking to the boost in longevity, but Lee says it's clear that moderate physical activity (walking or otherwise) is key to a healthy life.

"(Mar 25, 2008  9:27 AM CDT) Raising that little bundle of joy will come with a not-so-cute $204,060 price tag for middle-income families, according to a new government study. Factoring in inflation, the parents of a child born in 2007 can expect to spend $269,040 by the time that baby turns 18. Actual costs vary according to income and location, with the urban West the most expensive region to raise children and rural areas the least expensive. And, of course, the little darlings become more expensive as they get older. Housing will be the single largest cost for most US families—up to 33% of the total cost of raising a child. The cost of providing food decreased from 24% to 17% of the total, but child care and education expenses increased from 2% to 12%.

"(Sep 29, 2017  11:54 AM CDT) Wells Fargo is in the news again, though this time it's a rogue entity, not upper management, that's catching all the heat. Ex-bank teller Phelon Davis has pleaded guilty to stealing more than $185,000 from a bank customer over a two-year period, starting in October 2014, when the customer arrived with a trash bag filled with cash to deposit. It was then that Davis noticed the customer  had a surprisingly large balance with the bank,  per a signed crime statement. What made that cash cache surprising, per the Washington Post: The customer was homeless and had long kept accounts with the bank, though some had gone dormant. Not long after that interaction, Davis set up a new account in the customer's name (as well as a linked ATM card and email that Davis controlled) and started siphoning money, per a court filing. All told, Davis was said to have moved $177,400 into his fake account and withdrawn a total of $185,440. Per a release, Davis, 29, has pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of public property, a charge the Post notes was spurred by Davis taking at least $5,000 out of the account via ATMs in DC, then bringing the cash home to Maryland. He's accused of using the money to fund exotic Caribbean and Mexican vacations, as well as to pay down debt and cough up a home down payment. Meanwhile, the larger mystery remains: how the unnamed homeless victim came to be in possession of such a large amount of cash in the first place.  That's the million-dollar question,  Davis' attorney says, adding his client  greatly regrets the decisions he made.

After extensive research, Barnes uncovered the unsolved case of a toddler—who had a dime-size birthmark and snaking facial scar similar to his own—snatched outside a bakery on Long Island 54 years ago. Barnes—who resembles the father of the kidnapped toddler, now an Iowa farmer—says preliminary DNA comparisons with the boy's sister indicate they may be related.

Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, 35, also was ordered to be supervised for 10 years after his release. Abdul-Latif, also known as Joseph Anthony Davis, pleaded guilty in December to conspiracy to murder US officers and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. Prosecutors argued for a 19-year prison sentence with lifetime supervision following his release, saying Abdul-Latif directed major aspects of the planned attack, including picking the Military Entrance Processing Station in Seattle as a target.  This was a real attack plot,  said Assistant US Attorney Todd Greenberg. In conversations the FBI recorded with the help of the informant, Abdul-Latif and his co-defendant, Walli Mujahidh, discussed how they wanted to gun down people in the station as revenge for atrocities by US soldiers in Afghanistan, prosecutors said. Greenberg countered assertions by the defense that Abdul-Latif was a passive contributor to the plot, noting the defendant had been eager to take possession of machine guns and didn't back out of the plan when he had chances to do so.

They made their find using laser sensors known as Lidar, which outlined the city, called Mahendraparvata.  With this instrument—bang—all of a sudden we saw an immediate picture of an entire city that no one knew existed,  one of the archaeologists tells the Age. Atop a mountain, Mahendraparvata belonged to the Khmer Empire of southeast Asia, which dates between 800 and 1400 AD, NPR notes. Researchers then made their way to the site itself, using the Lidar data to navigate—along with help from an ex-Khmer Rouge soldier who lost a leg to landmines. The team discovered temple sites, signs of canals and roads, a cave full of ancient carvings, and a series of mounds that remain unexplained.

Ian Catley, 40, has received a seven-year sentence for manslaughter after admitting that he shot 46-year-old Philip Harper in the chest with a shotgun when his friend asked him to test what he thought was a bulletproof vest, reports the BBC. Police say that instead of protecting Harper, the plastic-lined vest funneled the shotgun spray into the center of his chest, killing him almost instantly, the Daily Mail reports. Catley's lawyer says that the day before the shooting, Harper had gone to the pub wearing his new vest and a SWAT cap and asked around to see if anybody was willing to help him test it.  You shot Mr. Harper at a distance of less than 20 feet, causing him catastrophic injuries and immediate death,  the judge said as he sentenced Catley.  You then, straight away, took him to hospital, but tragically, nothing could be done to save his life.  The judge acknowledged that Catley's  remorse is complete and genuine  and said he had no  doubt that the effects of killing your good friend will last with you for the rest of your life,  but he added that the risk of death or serious injury must have been  absolutely obvious.

That's because the school's oft-touted claim that since 1975, 90% of its graduates looking for employment found jobs in their field within six months actually has no basis in fact, according to the Department of Education. The university was asked to back up the assertion last year, but it  could not provide evidence to substantiate this claim,  the department announced Thursday. As part of a settlement, DeVry must now abandon the claim, post a notice on its website for two years noting the claim is unproven, and keep at least $68.4 million in reserves in case of any future issues, report NPR and the Wall Street Journal. However, unlike competitors Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute—which recently folded after missteps—DeVry will keep its access to federal funding. DeVry, which has more than 50 campuses nationwide, says it's  pleased  to have the issue cleared up, though it suggests its claim wasn't all that bogus. It says it simply lacked  student-specific data for the period from 1975 to October 1980.  The university adds it will  continue communicating its strong student outcomes.

Police are now sure the name was a fake, but they don't know much else about the man in his 60s. And as the Irish Times explains, the mystery endures because of odd details. For starters, he was seen on CCTV cameras leaving the hotel repeatedly (13 times in all) with a purple plastic bag filled with ... something. But when he returned, the bag was always empty. But he was never spotted discarding anything, or using a phone, or mailing letters despite buying 10 stamps, or doing anything that might shed light on his case.

In relations to the cameras, how he was able to go about his business without people learning anything more about him.  Bergmann, who spoke with an apparent German or Austrian accent, also scouted out a location to swim at a local beach with the help of a taxi driver, though he didn't actually swim at the time. He would return there later. Beachgoers reported seeing him walking along the shore at night, his trousers rolled up, and he was found the next morning, face down in the sand, a seeming drowning victim.

The breadth of offenses committed in this instance are frankly horrendous,  says Queensland Detective Inspector Jon Rouse. Investigators believe his crimes go back at least 10 years. Police say the man, who's already in jail and will be back in court next month, used platforms like Facebook and Skype to communicate with his victims, pretending to be the Canadian singer to persuade children under 16 to send him explicit images, CNN reports.  The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety,  Rouse says. The Courier Mail identifies the suspect as Gordon Douglas Chalmers, who was refused bail after his arrest in November when he refused to let investigators access his online accounts.",Cops: Man Posing as Bieber Charged With 900 Sex Offenses,Cops: Man Posing as Bieber Charged With ____ Sex Offenses,900,Copy( 900 ),0

The Orlando Sentinel reports that prison officials were fooled into thinking the men's sentences were shortened to 15 years. The mechanism? Forged court paperwork. Joseph Jenkins, 34, was released Sept. 27; Charles Walker, also 34, was set free on Oct. 8. The documents appeared to have been issued by the Orange County Clerk of Courts. A rep for the Department of Corrections says simply,  I don't know how it happened.  Police believe at least one of the men may currently be in Orange County; both are originally from the Orlando area. Walker had been serving a life sentence after a second-degree murder conviction for a 1999 shooting. Jenkins was convicted of murdering a father of six in 1998; the Sentinel reports he was also sentenced to life, but his prison file indicates he was serving 45 years for that crime, plus another five for car theft.",2 Fla.

"(Sep 12, 2019  10:24 AM CDT) Elizabeth Warren is out with her latest policy proposal, and she's calling for those on Social Security to receive an extra $200 a month. In a post at Medium detailing the proposal, Warren says the increased benefits would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy. The plan comes out hours ahead of the third Democratic debate, and the New York Times observes that it appears calculated to appeal to older voters who might be leaning toward Joe Biden. Warren's plan would cost more than $150 billion in its first year, per the Times. Specifically, Warren wants to impose a new 14.8% contribution requirement on individual wages above $250,000 a year, reports the Hill.  Currently, the rich contribute a far smaller portion of their income to Social Security than everyone else,  writes Warren.  That's wrong, and it's threatening the solvency of the program.  She maintains that her plan would not only result in a needed raise for beneficiaries, whose average monthly check is $1,354, but would extend the solvency of Social Security by two decades. The chances of her plan becoming reality? Pretty slim, notes Vox in an explainer.  But Warren’s Social Security pitch is a good guide to how she thinks about economic policy in general,  writes Matthew Yglesias. Her emphasis is on income inequality and how to remedy that. In her view, by taxing the rich— and taxing them fairly heavily—you unlock the possibility of raising living standards for almost everyone,  Yglesias notes.",Warren: Boost Social Security Payments $200 a Month,Warren: Boost Social Security Payments $____ a Month,200,Copy( 200 ),0

The now-shuttered Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, in the Panhandle town of Marianna, has been accused of rapes, beatings, and forced labor, and both relatives and survivors have long thought some residents' deaths were suspicious. Forensic anthropologists with the University of South Florida last year began exhuming graves in an effort to identify the boys, figure out how they died, and return their remains to their families for proper burials. All of the bodies, exhumed between September and December, appear to be those of children, CBS News reports; they were buried between the 1920s and 1950s, the AP adds. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement believed just 31 boys were buried in a cemetery on the grounds. But researchers could end up finding even more: Burial locations weren't always recorded, and the bodies found so far were all on the African-American side of the segregated school, which operated from 1900 to 2011. Researchers think there may be more boys buried on the white side, and they'll start excavating there next week.

But at the time of her death Monday, the 34-year-old Angus stood 7 feet 2 inches and weighed about 400 pounds. She was a victim of a rare disorder called acromegaly that wouldn't let her stop growing. Her condition was the result of the release of too much growth hormone caused by a non-cancerous tumor on her pituitary gland, and the disorder affected just about everything for Angus. She couldn't pull even the largest of shirts over her head, because she couldn't fit through the collar. She needed specially made shoes, and jewelers stretched her rings to size 20. Her mother said some people judged Angus, believing she used a wheelchair because she lacked the discipline to keep her weight down. What they didn't know is that she ate one meal a day, and her medications caused her face to swell. Angus eventually became an advocate for those with the disease.

According to a construction organization specializing in over-the-water platforms, it's the latter in the US, with almost 56,000  structurally deficient  bridges scattered across the country, USA Today reports. And the American Road and Transportation Builders Association's list doesn't just mention overpasses in remote towns with little budget to remedy the issue: Major bridges like NYC's Throgs Neck and DC's Arlington Memorial also have engineers shaking their heads. The nation's highway system is  woefully underperforming,  Dr. Alison Premo Black, ARTBA's chief economist, says of her group's analysis of DOT data, adding that the entire network is antiquated, lacking in funds, and in  desperate need of modernization.  Black says 28% of US bridges—which see 185 million crossings by vehicles daily—are more than 50 years old and have never had a major revamp. The report gives each of the bridges a rating of one to nine: nine being the best, anything four and under signifying a structurally iffy span that needs fixes (though USA Today notes that designation doesn't necessarily make a bridge  imminently unsafe ). The state with the most worrisome bridges is Iowa (nearly 5,000 bridges make the list), followed by Pennsylvania and Oklahoma. One of the biggest issues, per the National Association of Corrosion Engineers: rust, the Washington Post notes.

The Department of Justice spent more than two years investigating the system, which is a potential violation of privacy rights and the Fourth Amendment, releasing a report in September and briefing the House oversight committee Wednesday. The system worked like this: The DEA would recruit employees at Amtrak, airlines, and parcel companies and give them cash rewards any time they came to the DEA with evidence, typically large amounts of shipped cash. These sources were supposed to just be volunteering any evidence they came across, but that's not what happened. The Justice Department report found that the  voluntary  sources were basically unofficial paid DEA employees, with some even getting federal health benefits (possibly illegally). One parcel company employee made more than $1 million providing information to the DEA. And TSA employees were taking tips about suspicious packages to the DEA for cash rewards instead of going to their superiors. The DEA can't say how successful this expensive, potentially privacy-invading system was, because it didn't keep stats on false searches or bad information that came from the sources.

A family member, 24-year-old Gustavo Zavala-Garcia, has been charged with murder. Kayla went missing Tuesday night near Tyler, Texas, triggering an Amber Alert and a regional search. The search was called off on Saturday night, when police discovered her body in a well near a family member's house. She was wearing the same clothes as the night she disappeared. Different news outlets have described Zavala-Garcia as either an uncle, a cousin, or a cousin by marriage to Kayla. Zavala-Garcia was initially detained on an immigration hold while investigators put together a case. KETK reports Zavala-Garcia is an undocumented immigrant, and was deported in 2014 for an alleged violent crime.

Such is the case for US Forest Service firefighters as they arrived at a landfill Wednesday morning outside of Clearlake, Calif., ready to start working to contain the Clayton fire, Lake County News reports. A white Chevy pickup truck with two men inside was driving away just as they got there, and when the firefighters examined their bulldozers, which they used to create fire containment lines, there were shoe prints (not the firefighters') on and near the bulldozers. Further investigation revealed a bunch of the firefighters' gear to help them fight the blaze had been lifted from the vehicles, including a chainsaw, an emergency fire shelter, and a portable GPS unit. Clearlake cops spotted a vehicle matching the Chevy's description later that day rendezvousing with another truck, and they say most of the stolen gear (sans the GPS device) was found inside the trucks. Drivers Larry Hunter, 52, and Paul Albini, 47—both sporting footwear that matched the footprints found on the bulldozers—were arrested and charged on suspicion of grand theft and possession of methamphetamine, the Press Democrat reports.

"(Apr 30, 2014  3:20 PM CDT) Al Feldstein, whose 28 years at the helm of Mad magazine transformed the satirical publication into a pop culture institution, has died at his Montana home at age 88. In 1956, publisher William M. Gaines put Feldstein in charge of the magazine, which gleefully parodied politicians and mocked traditional morality. Feldstein and Gaines assembled a pool of artists and writers who turned out such enduring features as  Spy vs. Spy,  ''The Lighter Side of...  and  Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.  Building on a character used by Mad founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Feldstein turned the freckle-faced Alfred E. Neuman into an underground hero—a dimwitted everyman with a gap-toothed smile and the recurring stock phrase,  What, Me Worry?  Under Gaines and Feldstein, Mad's sales flourished, topping 2 million in the early 1970s. In a 1997 interview with the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Feldstein credited Mad's challenges to authority with helping incite the cultural revolution of the 1960s.  Who's covering up? That was one of our slogans,  he said.  We were orienting them to the adult world.

"(Aug 1, 2016  7:47 AM CDT) Last week, Australian officials said someone had plotted an Indian Ocean course on the flight simulator belonging to the pilot of missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370. This week, a renowned air-crash expert adds onto that, saying he believes the jet was deliberately brought down into the water, the BBC reports. Larry Vance, who once headed up Canada's Transportation Safety Board, appeared on the Aussie program 60 Minutes and said that  definite evidence  suggests a controlled landing, not an autopilot crash that would've left plenty of floating debris, per the Guardian.  Somebody was flying the airplane into the water,  he said on the program.  There is no other alternate theory that you can follow.  He also thinks  the fuselage is intact for the most part, and is on the bottom of the Indian Ocean,  per the Telegraph. Among the evidence Vance cites are photos of one of the plane's recovered wing flaperons. The jaggedness of the wing section—suggesting it had eroded off as it dragged across the water, rather than enduring a clean break if it had haphazardly crashed—as well as the fact that the flaperon had been deployed at all indicate someone likely guided the plane into the water, Vance said.  The force of the water is really the only thing that could make that jagged edge that we see,  he noted. Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigator Peter Foley agrees with the  rogue pilot  theory, noting that a closer look at the crash by French officials indicates the jet was in a  deployed state,  meaning the plane may have landed outside of the current search area. The ATSB hopes a second wing part discovered on the Tanzania coast may offer further clues about the plane's final moments, News.com.au reports.",'Definite Evidence' MH370 Was Crashed on Purpose: Expert,'Definite Evidence' MH____ Was Crashed on Purpose: Expert,370,Copy( 370 ),0
"(Jul 14, 2017  7:13 AM CDT) Millions of Americans who rely on Social Security can expect to see their biggest pay increase in years in January, per projections released Thursday by the program's trustees, the AP reports. The increase is projected to be just 2.2%, or about $28 a month for the average recipient. For context, this year Social Security recipients saw an increase of 0.3%, after getting nothing in 2016. Some good news for seniors: The trustees project Medicare Part B premiums will stay unchanged next year. Most beneficiaries pay $134 a month, though retirees with higher incomes pay more. Both Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment and Medicare Part B premiums will be announced in the fall. More than 61 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses, and surviving children receive Social Security benefits, with an average monthly payment of $1,253. Medicare provides health insurance to about 58 million people. Unless Congress acts, the trust funds that support Social Security are estimated to run dry in 2034, the same as last year's projection. Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care is projected to be depleted in 2029, a year later than last year's forecast. Over the past decade, Social Security and Medicare made up about 40% of federal spending, excluding interest on the debt; 50 years ago, the figure was 16%. The programs are expanding in part because the US is growing older: In 1960, there were 5.1 workers for each person getting Social Security benefits; today, there are about 2.8 workers for each beneficiary.",Social Security Recipients Projected to Get 2.2% Raise,Social Security Recipients Projected to Get ____% Raise,2.2,Copy( 2.2 ),0

As the Boston Globe reports,  For the first time in more than a decade, unencumbered by political considerations, (Romney) was free to spend his many millions without concern of how it might look.  And Romney went big with his homes: He pushed ahead with plans to raze aforementioned beach house in La Jolla, Calif., erecting a $12 million, 11,000-square-foot behemoth, complete with  a lift inside that will rotate two cars below grade to the basement area.  He bought an 8,730-square-foot home in Park City, Utah, that had what the Globe calls a  massive stone fireplace large enough to hold stockings for nearly two dozen grandchildren  and an accompanying $8.9 million price tag. And he built another 30 miles away near Salt Lake City, this one a farmhouse valued at $1.2 million. His fourth residence is a vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee, NH, which he's owned since 1997. All of which is a little tricky when one is considering a third run for the Oval Office, this time with an emphasis on poverty.  He wants to be close to his family,  says a longtime friend.  There’s nothing more important to him than his kids and grandkids. ... And if you could afford a house, and you’re as close as the Romneys are to their kids, that’s what you do.  But voters—though insiders say Romney flies coach, won't drop money on iPad apps, and has an apparent penchant for patching winter gloves with duct tape—might not see it that way. As a result, even as Romney dips his toes in 2016 waters, he's quietly showing the uncompleted La Jolla mansion to potential buyers and his lawyer says that, though the Romneys fought hard to get their building plans approved,  no decision has been made at this time whether to keep it, or sell it.  But he's got good company in the 1% in a potential rival:  It’s going to be hard for Hillary Clinton to make Mitt Romney’s wealth a fruitful line of attack, with her multimillion dollar mansions in Georgetown and Chappaqua and her jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and famous,  says an aide.","After 2012 Loss, Romney Went on Real Estate Binge","After ____ Loss, Romney Went on Real Estate Binge",2012,Copy( 2012 ),0

The Wall Street Journal reports these  income-driven repayment plans  have been available through the Education Department since 2007, meaning balances won't start going to zero until 2027. And when they do, expect a  bomb.  That's because the balance that's forgiven is considered income for that year, meaning the borrower has to pay tax on it. The Journal does the math: One estimate expects such borrowers to have $41,000 forgiven on average. At a 25% income tax rate, that would mean a $10,250 tax bill. On the more eye-popping end of the spectrum, it references an orthodontist it interviewed who had student-loan debt in excess of $1 million; that associated tax bill could be $700,000. (Forbes notes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program doesn't levy taxes on the forgiven amount).  I'm very doubtful that everybody is going to be able to make these tax payments,  said Constantine Yannelis, who worked in the Treasury Department under Obama. The IRS could place liens on homes or garnish Social Security checks, but some experts expect that as 2027 approaches, Congress will see heavy pressure to act; eliminating the tax could put taxpayers on the hook for billions in student-loan costs.",A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in 2027,A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in ____,2027,Copy( 2027 ),0
"(Dec 12, 2020  7:30 AM) Three snow leopards in a Kentucky zoo have come down with COVID-19, making it the latest type of animal to get sick after coming into close contact with humans. Per a filmed statement from Louisville Zoo Director John Walczak and a written statement from the zoo, zoo staff noticed within the past two weeks that female leopard NeeCee and male leopards Kimti and Meru were exhibiting respiratory issues, including occasional wheezing and dry coughs. Samples were immediately sent out for testing, and all three came back positive for the coronavirus. CNN notes that, with the snow leopards, this makes at least six animal species that have come down with the illness. Others include tigers and lions at New York City's Bronx Zoo, a handful of dogs and cats, and minks in Denmark. Walczak says the cats' symptoms are  very mild.  So how did the leopards contract the virus in the first place? The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service speculates that,  despite precautions taken by the zoo,  it was from a staff member who was infected but not showing symptoms, per CNN. The good news is that all three leopards are expected to recover, Walczak notes, adding that no other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms of the virus. Although it doesn't seem likely that the virus can be transmitted back from the big cats to humans, all three leopards have been taken off exhibit until they recover, the zoo says.",Latest to Get Hit by COVID: 3 Big Cats,Latest to Get Hit by COVID: ____ Big Cats,3,Trans( Three ),1
"(Feb 1, 2015  8:12 AM) A team of builders and designers have created what is essentially a house that can fit in a room. Cubitat is a 10-by-10-by-10-foot cube, and it's got practically everything you need built in, Treehugger reports. One side has a whole kitchen, with a sink, dishwasher, fridge, and more, all in a single wall. Another side features a pullout bed from which you can watch a TV mounted in a nook. Need a bathroom? The cube's got a built-in toilet. It even features a laundry machine and storage space. You'll have to hook it up to plumbing and electricity, but the makers—a Toronto firm called Urban Capital and a designer named Luca Nichetto—say the idea of Cubitat is a  plug and play  space, Slate reports. They call it, per CTV,  the most adaptable home imagined.   Cubitat is about a more intelligent, holistic way to design and construct our living environments, taking cues from the prefab world and modern production methods,  says an Urban Capital developer.  As a builder we look at the automotive, consumer product, and tech industries and ask why we can’t operate with that much rapidity and flexibility.  Among the minor kinks to be worked out: How do you fit a 10-foot cube through your door? Well, maybe you won't have to:  The idea is to hoist and slide Cubitat onto a condo floor mid-construction,  says a project description, per Slate. And when you're feeling less urban, you can  ship Cubitat from the city to the country so you retire in your own home.  (Perhaps the designers could give some tips to the EU parliament, whose building is so confusing it's nearly left some in tears.)",How a Whole House Can Fit in a 10-Foot Cube,How a Whole House Can Fit in a ____-Foot Cube,10,Copy( 10 ),0

Yesterday's winning bid on the Dell Poweredge R410,  complete with hard drives, motherboard and everything,  came from a 17-year-old, but the cash—$33,000—was to come from his unknowing dad's account, Wired reports. It was no mistaken clicking either; the boy initially bid $10,200, then bid seven more times before he finally won the server, described on eBay as the  notorious physical server that changed the world.  The server's actual worth is probably closer to $4,000, but it's  a relic of our time,  Bahnhof's CEO tells Reuters.  I believe this box has a very high symbolical value. In a way, it is a kind of artifact, an object that has made a mark on world history.  But WikiLeaks, not too thrilled with the auction, claimed it wasn't as important as Bahnhof made it out to be.

Rick Scott removed Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Aramis Ayala from the  horrendous cases  Monday after she criticized capital punishment as costly and inhumane, reports CNN and NBC Miami. The cases have been transferred to State Attorney Brad King. King also took over the high-profile case of Markeith Loyd last month after Ayala said she would not consider capital punishment. Her refusal to do so for the remainder of her four-year term, which began in January,  sends an unacceptable message that she is not interested in considering every available option in the fight for justice,  Scott says. Scott, who says the thought of victims' families helped him make his decision, adds that he has the authority to appoint a special prosecutor given his  solemn constitutional duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'  However, a rep for Ayala—who claims she only learned of Scott's decision through the media—says she  remains steadfast in her position the Governor is abusing his authority and has compromised the independence and integrity of the criminal justice system.  Others have echoed her sentiments, including Democratic state Rep. Sean Shaw, who says Scott's decision represents a  gross abuse of his power.

"(Dec 6, 2011  12:46 AM) Two men who have accused a dead Boston Red Sox clubhouse manager of sexually abusing them when they were batboys are filing a $10 million lawsuit against the team.  These were inner city kids happy to have jobs with the Red Sox,  said their lawyer yesterday.  Then they were sexually molested by Donald Fitzpatrick, a serial pedophile. It's similar to the Penn State case.  Fitzpatrick died in 2005 at the age of 76. The team settled a $3.15 million lawsuit with seven Florida men in 2003 who accused Fitzpatrick of molesting them during spring training in the 1970s, and Fitzpatrick pleaded guilty in 2002 to four counts of attempted sexual battery. The team also paid $100,000 to a former clubhouse attendant who charged that he was assaulted during a team trip. This is the first time accusations have involved incidents at Fenway Park, according to the Boston Globe. One of the men in the current lawsuit, Charles Crawford, said Fitzpatrick assaulted him twice in 1991—in a restroom and an equipment room at Fenway—when he was a 16-year-old batboy.  I’ve held one of Boston’s darkest secrets all these years, knowing people would have been blown out of their seats if they knew what the Red Sox let happen to me,’’ he said. A Red Sox attorney said officials were unaware of the incidents in the lawsuit, but that the team has  always viewed the actions of Mr. Fitzpatrick to be abhorrent.  When the Sox became aware of other allegations against Fitzpatrick in 1991, the manager was  promptly relieved of his duties,  the attorney added.

Water temps there can hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and that's causing the ships to lose power, CNN reports. During a Defense Committee meeting Tuesday, MPs interrogated company execs about the Type 45 destroyers—said to be the country's most advanced warships ever and expected to last at least two more decades—and their assessments were less than encouraging. A director from ship designer Rolls-Royce—which claims it was never informed the 8,000-ton ships would sail for long periods in such warm waters, per the Mirror—says that equipment is struggling to perform in  far more arduous conditions [than] were initially required,  resulting in  total electrical failure.  The Sun explains what causes the ships to turn into  sitting ducks : There are two turbines on each ship that redistribute exhaust heat back to the engine, but in too-warm waters the turbines slow down; a  domino effect  leads to engine shutdown and, eventually, a complete power outage. Reaction in Parliament was mainly astonishment.  I'm just absolutely stunned,  one MP said.  It's a [$1.4 billion] asset that you're putting into perhaps a war zone, and we don't know if these people … will go in there and come back out alive because there might be a problem with the power system on the ship.

President Barack Obama condemned the Republican action and said he'd act unilaterally, as best he could. A day after GOP leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat, tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $694 million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program created by Obama granting work permits to immigrants brought here illegally as kids.

Because Kennard had an extensive database of shipwrecks—he's helped track down more than 200 shipwrecks since the '70s—and an idea of the Royal Albert's size and shape, they were able to ID the vessel. A remote-controlled vehicle sent to take pictures and video of the ship offered more evidence of their find. The 104-foot-long schooner, which Kennard says sank 15 miles west of Oswego, was transporting 285 tons of railroad iron on Aug. 10, 1868, when something happened (some say bad weather) to make the railroad iron move, causing it to tear a hole in the side of the vessel; Kennard tells the AP some of those rails can be seen in video of the ship's hold. The crew safely made it to shore in a small boat. Kennard and his fellow explorers were out on the lake thanks to the National Museum of the Great Lakes, which funds volunteer shipwreck explorers, per the Toledo Blade.  Our collaboration with Jim Kennard and his team have produced some of the most important discoveries on Lake Ontario,  the museum's director said. As for the Royal Albert, it will likely stay put, per local and federal shipwreck laws.  It's essentially an underwater museum of maritime history,  Kennard tells the Democrat & Chronicle.

The problem started when hackers took control of more than 570,000 computers worldwide in an online ad scam, the AP reports. When dealing with the virus, known as  DNS Changer,  the FBI realized that dismantling the malicious servers that were controlling the infected computers would actually cause the victims to lose Internet service entirely. So the FBI instead installed two clean servers to take over for the malicious servers, but those will be shut down at 12:01am Monday. They were costing tens of thousands of dollars to run, the Telegraph notes. The FBI also set up a website where people can quickly check to see if their computer is affected by the malware, but even though it only takes a moment, more than 277,000 are still estimated to be infected, including 64,000 US customers and 50 of the Fortune 500 companies.

"(Feb 3, 2020  7:22 PM) Caucus voting began across Iowa Monday night with Democrats balancing their desire for fundamental change with their craving to defeat President Trump as they opened the first contest of the 2020 presidential primary season, per the AP. Polls suggested that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders might have a narrow lead, but any of the top four candidates—Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg—could score a victory in Iowa's unpredictable and quirky caucus system as organizers prepared for record turnout. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who represents neighboring Minnesota, was also claiming momentum, while outsider candidates including entrepreneur Andrew Yang, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard could be factors. Meanwhile, ultrabillionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is running a parallel campaign that ignores Iowa as he prepares to pounce on any perceived weaknesses in the field come March. The amalgam of oddities, including new rules for reporting the already complicated caucus results, was building toward what could be a murky Iowa finale before the race pivots quickly to New Hampshire, which votes just eight days later. New party rules may give more than one candidate an opportunity to claim victory, even if they aren't the official winner.

"(Oct 11, 2014  4:38 PM CDT) Flooding due to high tides will become very routine on the East Coast by 2045, a study finds: In fact, Washington, DC and Annapolis, MD, will likely face  nuisance  floods more than once per day, researchers suggest. Cities like Miami and Atlantic City will see such floods about 240 days per year, while Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Charleston, SC, should brace for about 180 days of flooding. The study examines tidal, or  nuisance,  flooding, which isn't necessarily a huge problem on its own, the Washington Post reports. But when it mixes with big storms, the results can be life-threatening. Already,  in parts of New York City and elsewhere, homeowners are dealing with flooded basements, salt-poisoned yards, and falling property values, not only because of catastrophic storms, but because tides, aided by sea level rise, now cause flooding where they live,  says the Union of Concerned Scientists, which conducted the study. Right now, tidal floods hit Washington, DC, and Annapolis fewer than 50 days per year. But at least one expert is questioning the details of the findings, noting that they're based on sea levels rising four feet by century's end. That level of rising is actually just one of four possibilities that climate scientists regularly put forward, NOAA oceanographer William Sweet tells the Post.","Washington, DC Will See Daily Floods by 2045","Washington, DC Will See Daily Floods by ____",2045,Copy( 2045 ),0

She conceded in an interview on German public television that the meeting's outcome  wasn't a great thing.  Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the other leaders clashed with Trump over steel and aluminum tariffs as well as his decision to abandon a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program.

The final tally was 54-42 in favor of the measure—with three Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against it—but it needed 60 votes to move ahead. Supporters of the bill, which passed the House in May, say fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks, reports NBC News. Critics say that such late abortions are rare but occasionally medically necessary and that the exemptions written into the bill—for rape, incest, and the safety of the mother—were too vaguely worded. Republican Susan Collins, who voted against the ban, says it would  make a criminal out of a physician  for trying to keep pregnant women from being seriously injured. The Hill reports that even had the bill passed it likely would have been legally challenged, as federal courts have struck down similar state bans for violating the Supreme Court's protection of abortion rights. Harry Reid called the vote a  waste of time  and insinuated it was merely an attempt by Republicans to ingratiate themselves with the pope, who speaks at the Capitol Thursday, according to NBC.

"(Sep 20, 2016  1:01 PM CDT) A suspected serial killer is now linked to five deaths, police say, and authorities think the number may grow. In the newest revelation, Shawn Grate, 40—arrested in Ohio last week—has admitted to killing his first victim in 2005 in Marion County, police say. Grate reportedly told police he stabbed the unknown woman—whose remains were discovered in 2007 but have yet to be identified—because his mother ordered magazines from her that never arrived, per People and WOIO. Grate said he returned to her shallow grave a year after the murder to burn her body to ensure his DNA wouldn't be found, police say. Authorities believe Grate also strangled Rebekah Leicy, whose remains were found in a field in Ashland in March 2015, reports the Washington Post. After Grate was discovered holding a woman captive in a home where the remains of two other women—Stacey Stanley, 43, and Elizabeth Griffin, 29—were found last week, police say he led authorities to the body of yet another woman, Candice Cunningham, 29, reports Fox 8. She is believed to have died in June. Grate, jailed on $1 million bail, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping so far with more charges expected.  He's obviously a serial killer,  the Marion County sheriff says, adding that Grate was  very polite  during questioning.  It's hard to believe there aren't other bodies out there.  An ex-girlfriend tells WOIO that Grate previously beat her up, stalked her, and promised  he would come back to get me. … Had I not got away, it could've very well been me.","Cops: 'Polite' Serial Killer Murdered 5, Maybe More","Cops: 'Polite' Serial Killer Murdered ____, Maybe More",5,Trans( five ),1
"(Apr 17, 2014  3:20 PM CDT) Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel laureate whose novels and short stories exposed tens of millions of readers to Latin America's passion, superstition, violence, and inequality, died today at his home in Mexico City at age 87. Widely considered the most popular Spanish-language writer since Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century, the Colombia native achieved literary celebrity that spawned comparisons to Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. His flamboyant and melancholy fictional works—among them Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Love in the Time of Cholera, and Autumn of the Patriarch—outsold everything published in Spanish except the Bible. The epic 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude sold more than 50 million copies in more than 25 languages. His stories made him literature's best-known practitioner of magical realism, the fictional blending of the everyday with fantastical elements such as a boy born with a pig's tail and a man trailed by a swarm of yellow butterflies. When he accepted the Nobel prize in 1982, Garcia Marquez described Latin America as a  source of insatiable creativity, full of sorrow and beauty, of which this roving and nostalgic Colombian is but one cipher more, singled out by fortune.",Gabriel Garcia Marquez Dead at 87,Gabriel Garcia Marquez Dead at ____,87,Copy( 87 ),0

The Iraqi prime minister abruptly canceled a $4.2 billion arms deal agreed to last month that would have made Moscow the nation's No. 2 arms supplier behind the US, reports AFP. A Maliki spokesman says the prime minister got wind of  corruption  and kickbacks related to the deal, but AFP's Moscow source thinks the US pressured Baghdad into scrapping it. The BBC quotes the head of the Center for Analysis of World Arms Trade, and he agrees:  As soon as the deal was announced a month ago I said that the US would not allow Iraq to buy such huge quantities of weapons from Russia.

"(Apr 3, 2019  8:20 AM CDT) As the Trump administration continues to try to dismantle ObamaCare, with a GOP plan now not expected until after the 2020 election, some sobering statistics have emerged underscoring the necessity for affordable health care. Per the New York Times, a survey released Tuesday by Gallup and the West Health nonprofit shows about 25% of respondents have held off on medical treatment because of the cost, while 45% are afraid they'll go bankrupt in the event of a  major health event,  per a release. Another big number from the survey, which polled 3,500 US adults by phone in early 2019: the $88 billion Americans have borrowed over the past year to pay for health care.  Our data shows an American public that's beaten down from this really serious issue,  a Gallup researcher tells the Times. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they're  completely  or  mostly  satisfied with the current health-care system based on their own experiences, though that number plunges to 39% when asked how well the system takes care of Americans in general. There's also a schism between Republicans and Democrats, with 67% of self-identified GOPers saying the US system is the best or one of the best in the world, while only 38% of Democrats say the same. However,  there is very little that separates the groups when it comes to the real-life consequences of the high cost of health care on their everyday lives,  Tim Lash, West Health's chief strategy officer, says in the release.  The time has come to take politics out of the equation and deal with the realities of the health care cost crisis with bipartisan and common-sense solutions that serve all Americans.",Health Care Costs Sent Americans Into $88B Debt in Last Year,Health Care Costs Sent Americans Into $____B Debt in Last Year,88,Copy( 88 ),0

Reynolds' niece confirms to CNN that her uncle died of heart failure Monday at the age of 96 in a hospital in Burbank, Calif. Per Deadline, Reynolds started working for the small screen in the late '50s, writing for the NBC Western Tales of Wells Fargo. Soon he was directing series such as Leave It to Beaver, The Munsters, The Andy Griffith Show, and My Three Sons, and he started producing in the '60s for such shows as Hogan's Heroes, F Troop, and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. But it was MASH, created with Larry Gelbart based on the 1970 movie of the same name, that really put Reynolds on the map.

That's likely the feeling of nearly two dozen sets of parents in Maryland's Prince George's County after Smith yanked their children off a school bus that burst into flames Monday, ABC News reports. Smith had made just a few stops on her afternoon run in College Park when she heard beeping and saw smoke. But when she stopped the bus to call for help, her heart stopped at the sight of flames in her rearview mirror.  I … undid my seatbelt, jumped up, got my babies, and got off,  she says, adding that after she got all of the kids off the bus, the entire vehicle became engulfed in black smoke and flames.

Local residents rushed to the scene to help escort the 20 schoolchildren from Glenarden Woods Elementary School to safety. But Smith, a mother of two, was still uneasy, WUSA reports. She feared one of the younger kids may have dozed off on the ride home and was still on the bus—so she ran back inside.  She … checked each seat to see if any of the students were left there,  a resident at the scene tells ABC.  It's a fairly long bus.

Now the raisin growers have had enough, the Los Angeles Times reports.

"(Jul 27, 2015  2:40 PM CDT) Boston's bid to host the 2024 Olympics is over. A person familiar with the decision told the AP that the city and the US Olympic Committee severed ties after a board teleconference today. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not yet been made public. The decision throws the bid process—and hopes that the US will host another Olympics—into flux. Only seven weeks remain before cities have to be officially nominated. If the USOC wants to stay in the race, Los Angeles is its likely choice. The Boston bid soured within days of its beginning in January, beset by poor communication and an active opposition group that kept public support low. It also failed to get—and keep—the support of key politicians. Earlier today, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced he would not be pressured into signing the host city contract that puts the city on the hook for any cost overruns. Gov. Charlie Baker had been unwilling to pledge his support, waiting instead to see a full report from a consulting group that wasn't scheduled to be complete until next month. The US hasn't hosted a Summer Olympics since the Atlanta Games in 1996, or any Olympics since the Salt Lake City Winter Games in 2002. That timing, along with the USOC's vastly improved relationship with its international partners, made this look like a race that was America's to lose, even against world-class cities such as Rome and Paris.",Boston Bid Ends for 2024 Olympics,Boston Bid Ends for ____ Olympics,2024,Copy( 2024 ),0
"(Dec 9, 2016  6:44 PM) Eighteen years ago, the  Avondale Quads  were born to a couple living in a small one-bedroom apartment in Avondale, Arizona. Thanks to news articles about the impending birth of the quadruplets, donations of money and baby necessities poured in for Elizabeth Whittle and Anthony Perez. Despite the donations and the fact that she said the babies were a gift from God,  my birth mom could not handle four babies at once,  Hannah Nelson, born Megan Perez, says now. At just four months old, Hannah and her three brothers were hospitalized with dozens of broken bones, skull fractures, and other injuries; eventually, Elizabeth Whittle was sent to prison for child abuse and her husband was also jailed for failing to protect his babies. Now that the four are adults and embarking on a new chapter in their lives, the Arizona Republic takes a long look at their story. Hannah was adopted by one family; brothers Michael and Matthew were adopted by another; and brother Brandon was adopted by a third. The siblings kept in touch throughout their childhoods, always gathering to celebrate their birthday together, and the realization of the full tragedy of their early days dawned on them slowly, at different times. All four have defied the odds—even the most severely injured, Brandon, is a  miracle,  says his dad, considering doctors didn't think he'd live past 10 years old. He can't talk or walk and will always need full-time care. His three siblings also had to overcome their fair share of difficulties related to their past abuse, both physical and emotional. Today, Hannah is a freshman at Grand Canyon University aiming to be a nurse in a neonatal intensive-care unit; Matthew is at a yearlong Christian discipleship program in California aiming to become a pastor; and Michael is living in an apartment in Mesa, Arizona.

No major damage or injuries were reported, though water main breaks, power outages, toppled store shelves, and shattered glass were seen throughout Orange and Los Angeles counties, reports AP and NBC Los Angeles. Maybe the most dramatic image came from Brea, where the quake triggered a rock slide that overturned a car. All escaped with only minor injuries. The US Geological Service says the quake struck about 9:09pm local time and was centered near Brea, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. It was relatively shallow, at 5 miles deep. At least 20 smaller aftershocks followed, including two in the 3-point range, reports the LA Times. A temblor of magnitude-3.6 preceded the bigger quake by about an hour.

It's no longer a statewide party,  and that's because, he says, members  have become too doctrinaire on the social issues. It’s become a cult.  In fact, the party has been struggling since 1994, when it embraced a tough illegal immigration stance that drove away the booming Hispanic vote. But state party chairman Tom Beccaro is hopeful that Republican economic positions will pave the way to a brighter future in a state where  the budget is way out of balance  and unemployment is the country's third-highest.

Citi, which took $45 billion in federal bailout funds, also plans to offer its employees stock options to keep them on. Citi says the move is just reorganization.  Any salary adjustments are not intended to increase total annual compensation, rather to adjust the balance between fixed and variable compensation,  a spokesman said.

But Syrian forces fired on the protesters, killing at least eight, activists said. In the Syrian town of Qusair near the Lebanese border, Syrian forces closed all mosques to prevent people from gathering. The weekly protests usually begin as Syrians pour out of mosques following Friday afternoon prayers. The Syrian uprising has proved remarkably resilient over the past seven months, but it has shown some signs of stalling in recent weeks as the government continues a bloody crackdown that the UN estimates has killed more than 3,000 people. Now the armed uprising in Libya that drove Gadhafi from power—albeit with NATO air support—appears to have breathed new life into the Syrian revolt.

"(Nov 11, 2014  7:03 AM) The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled  Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,  the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that  careful estimates  put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the  biggest bombshell for some.  The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed  for eternity alone,  suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were  for time and eternity ). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the  wrenching trial  of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that  the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.  Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share  reliable, faith-promoting  info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

More than three decades later, police have arrested a suspect in her murder, the News Tribune reports. Gary Charles Hartman, 66, was booked into jail on suspicion of first-degree murder. Police have not yet said how they zeroed in on him, though a news conference set for Friday was expected to shed more light on his arrest.

Cirk believed his internet girlfriend, known only as Zhang, was going to meet him at Changsha airport. But she wasn't there when he arrived, and she didn't show up over the next 10 days, which Cirk spent living in the airport. Cirk likely would have kept waiting for Zhang except that he had to be taken to the hospital for physical exhaustion, according to Metro. After leaving the hospital, Cirk flew home without ever meeting his would-be love interest. But Zhang says we shouldn't be too quick to judge her.

Instead, in an 11th-hour deal, they've settled for $260 million against three major distributors and a manufacturer for their role in the opioid epidemic, the Wall Street Journal reports. The sum of money granted to Summit and Cuyahoga counties means there'll be no trial kicking off Monday against McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen, as well as Teva Pharmaceuticals, though another big defendant, Walgreens, wasn't part of the last-minute settlement; it's not clear if the trial will go on as planned against Walgreens. The Washington Post reports that a sixth smaller defendant, Henry Schein Medical, reached its own settlement for $1.25 million, though CNBC notes that Schein hadn't been sued by Cuyahoga County, and Summit's claims were  dismissed.  The distributors will reportedly pony up $215 million in cash to the two counties, with Teva contributing $20 million in cash and $25 million in drugs designed to fight addiction. The counties claimed that the drug companies, driven by a desire for profit, promoted a  public nuisance  by not adequately monitoring the deluge of opioids there, and that they acted in effect like a drug cartel, conspiring together to expand their market, per the Post. With this settlement, the firms can now focus on structuring a larger one involving what the Post calls  multidistrict litigation  being brought by more than 2,400 other counties, cities, Native American tribes, and other entities across the US.

Officials say that for the first time since the outbreak began, there were no new locally transmitted infections and no new cases at all in Hubei province, where the capital, Wuhan, has been locked down since Jan. 23, the Guardian reports.

These are the five siblings the Kansas City Star featured in its  Family Wanted  section on Saturday, and they're looking to all be adopted by the same family. Response to the ad about the siblings has been  pretty insane,  Corey Lada of the Kansas Children's Service League, affiliated with the state's Adopt Kansas Kids organization, tells the Star.

The kids, ages 2 to 11, are identified only by their first names, and Lada didn't reveal much else about them other than to say they're all in different foster homes and that their case has been removed from the state website because so many inquiries have poured in. Some critics have suggested the response has been so great because the kids are white: One Overland Park resident, for instance, says the children look like they stepped out of a  Lands' End ad  and that kids of other races—the Star notes Kansas has around 1,200 kids looking for families—don't get the same hype.

Most of the new troops will be devoted to the buildup of the newly retaken Qayara air base, about 40 miles south of Mosul, and include engineers, logistics personnel, and other forces, Carter said in Baghdad, per the AP. They will help Iraqi security forces planning to encircle and eventually retake the key city.

CNN reports Apple's 15-year streak—dating back to the debut of iPod in 2001—officially ended Tuesday when the tech giant announced sales of $216 billion in 2016, an $18 billion drop from 2015. The decline in sales was mostly due to slumping iPhone sales, as well as tougher competition in China, where Apple's sales fell by 30% in 2016. Apple shares dropped 2% after the figures were released Tuesday, according to Forbes. Regardless, Apple CEO Tim Cook says it was a  very successful fiscal 2016.

Porsche's board voted to boost the sports car manufacturer's stake in Volkswagen to more than 50% yesterday, only hours after Volkswagen said it would buy a controlling interest in Swedish truck company Scania. The combined $225 billion company would be the biggest car and truck firm in Europe.

The plane was supposed to land in New York at 3:30pm, but high winds forced it to circle for hours. Finally it landed in Newburgh, 90 miles away, where it sat on the tarmac until almost midnight, passengers tell the New York Post. One passenger had a panic attack and was escorted off by police. Food supplies ran so low that Pringles had to be rationed, at four chips per passenger. Eventually Jet Blue, which has facilities in Newburgh, got buses to carry the passengers the last two and a half hours to New York. They finally arrived at 2am. To make the PR disaster even worse for Virgin, one of the passengers was a social media executive, who posted constant updates about the experience online.

Sarah Lane, a performer with the American Ballet Theatre, now says she performed some 95% of the  full body shot  dances in Black Swan.  I would say 5% are Natalie,  says Lane.  From a professional dancer's standpoint, she doesn't look like a professional ballet dancer at all, and she can't dance in pointe shoes. And she can't move her body—she's very stiff.  Ouch. Lane says she was warned by the producers not to talk about how much she danced, reports ABC News. Lane lashed out after Portman's fiancé, Benjamin Millepied, boasted recently that the Academy Award-winning actress was largely responsible for the dance scenes.  Articles now talking about her dance double are making it sound like Lane did a lot of the work but really, she just did the footwork, and one diagonal in the studio,  Millepied said.

Garr Keith Hardin and Jeffrey Dewayne Clark, who spent 24 years in prison in Kentucky after being accused of a satanic murder, had their convictions vacated after a brief hearing Monday in which a judge decided no credible evidence remained against them, the Louisville Courier Journal reports. Hardin, 48, and Clark, 47, were arrested in 1992 after the murder of Rhonda Warford, 19, who was stabbed to death and dumped in a field 50 miles from her home. She had spoken of being harassed by a strange man, but investigators focused on ex-boyfriend Hardin instead. The two men were convicted of her murder in 1995. The men were released from prison in 2016 because of new forensic testing and evidence of police misconduct, the AP reports. Detective Mark Handy, who's accused of fabricating witness statements, is already being sued in connection with several other cases. Both Hardin and Clark have filed federal lawsuits. Innocence Project lawyer Seema Saifee says  unconscionable misconduct  by police resulted in prison for the men, who were accused of killing the teen as part of a satanic sacrifice.  They stole their youth, but they couldn't take away their dignity,  Saifee says.  A lot of people ask me why I ain't so bitter,  Clark tells WAVE 3.

Pistorius' release, recommended by a prison committee for good behavior, would come 10 months into his five-year sentence if the parole board approves, the AP reports; the BBC adds that under South African law, he's eligible for probation after serving one-sixth of his sentence (which would be 10 months) and would be kept under  correctional supervision,  or house arrest, during his probation period.

Clad only in light jackets and sweaters, the three apparently didn't know how rapidly the weather would turn ugly, and that proved deadly. Searchers found the soaked bodies of 36-year-old David Decareaux and the two boys—ages 8 and 10—on the Ozark Trail on Sunday, a day after Decareaux declined a passerby's offer of a ride back to the lodge where they had been staying, said the local sheriff. The cold killed them. Only the family's 4-month-old yellow Labrador retriever survived. He was found near Decareaux, who died at the scene, and the two boys, who were declared dead at a hospital after hours of efforts to revive them failed. It was nearly 60 degrees Saturday morning when Decareaux and his sons set out on the popular trail in southeast Missouri. They were ill-equipped as the temperature sank into the 40s and a storm that would drop 2 inches of rain set in, making the trail all but impassable.

Under a new proposal from the city's health commissioner and City Council speaker, New Yorkers would have to wait until their 21st birthday to buy cigarettes, the New York Times reports. That would be the highest threshold of any major US city; the smoking age is currently 18 in New York and most of the rest of the country but goes as high as 19 in four states and some counties. Just one Massachusetts suburb has it set at 21. It's not clear whether it would be illegal for under-21s to possess cigarettes, or just to purchase them. The proposal is just NYC's latest effort to crack down on smoking: After Michael Bloomberg took office, smoking was banned in restaurants, bars, parks, beaches, plazas, and other public spaces; Bloomberg is also trying to make retailers hide tobacco products. But his policy of putting up graphic anti-smoking ads in stores selling cigarettes was reversed in court. Another proposed bill would set a minimum price for a pack of cigarettes: $10.50, CBS News reports.",NYC Wants to Raise Smoking Age to 21,NYC Wants to Raise Smoking Age to ____,21,Copy( 21 ),0

This comes despite voters widely disapproving of Obama's handling of the economy—only 43% approve, while 53% disapprove. So why is Obama winning? Because voters just plain don't like Romney. Only 39% view him favorably, and 55% say he is more  out of touch,  with voters. A plurality also say they're better off now than four years ago. Forty-five percent say they're better off, to only 36% who say they're worse off.  I'm just tired of the doom and gloom,  says one independent voter.

Cook told Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's Mad Money, Wednesday that the company is starting a $1 billion fund to help create advanced manufacturing jobs in the US. He said the company wants to be the  ripple in the pond.   Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs ... those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them,  Cook explained. Apple says its products support around 2 million American jobs, though it only directly employs about 80,000 people in the US. Cook told CNBC that he believes a company should have values—and one of those values should be  giving back  to the community.  We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy,  he said.  We give back in job creation.  He said the fund's first investment will be made this month.

But after hearing searing testimony from 15 victims Tuesday, US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis sentenced the unrepentant 60-year-old to 120 years in prison, the AP reports. Former followers including India Oxenberg daughter of Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, described Raniere as a sexual predator who manipulated women, pressured followers to have sex with him, and branded female  slaves  with his initials. Prosecutors said Raniere, who was also convicted on a child pornography charge, kept compromising material to ensure that the women remained obedient. The first victim to speak, identified as Camila, said Raniere had started abusing her when she was 15 and he was 45, the New York Times reports. She said he ordered her to weigh less than 100 pounds and expected her to be available for sex at all hours. Her mother, brother, and a sister also spoke.

The central bank also said Wednesday that it will seek to push inflation above 2% annually. The Fed left its benchmark short-term rate unchanged at nearly zero, where it has been since the pandemic intensified in March. The Fed's benchmark interest rate influences borrowing costs for homebuyers, credit card users, and businesses. Fed policymakers hope an extended period of low interest rates will encourage more borrowing and spending, though their new policy also carries risks of inflating stock or causing other financial market bubbles, the AP reports.",Fed Plans to Leave Rates Unchanged Until 2023,Fed Plans to Leave Rates Unchanged Until ____,2023,Copy( 2023 ),0
"(Apr 2, 2014  8:12 AM CDT) As GM wrestles with its own deadly safety concerns, Chrysler is issuing a recall of its own. The move affects nearly 870,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs over concerns that corrosion may make the vehicles' brakes harder to use. Model years 2011 through 2014 are involved. Chrysler says crimp joints in the brake boosters can corrode if they're exposed to water. If the water freezes, the boosters won't aid braking as they usually do. Chrysler began investigating after some customers said their brakes felt too firm when pressed down. The company knows of one accident, but no injuries, due to the defect. Dealers will install a shield to protect the boosters for free and replace boosters that aren't working properly. Chrysler has since changed the design to make the boosters more corrosion resistant.

"(Aug 5, 2016  7:54 AM CDT) Employers added a healthy 255,000 jobs last month, a sign of confidence amid sluggish growth that points to a resilient US economy, reports the AP. It's the second straight month of strong growth. The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate remained a low 4.9% in July. More Americans launched job searches, and nearly all were hired, but the influx of job seekers meant that the number of unemployed fell only slightly. The headline number of 255,000 came in well above the estimate of 179,000, notes the Wall Street Journal.  I certainly wouldn’t go so far as to say this number means a September hike is a done-deal,  writes Paul Vigna at the Journal.  In fact, I personally don’t think this number could have possibly been high enough to make that true. However, this report does raise the odds on another hike.  When that happens is the question. The figures suggest that US employers shook off concerns about Britain's late-June vote to quit the European Union. Nor were they apparently discouraged by tepid growth in the first half of the year of just 1% at an annual rate.

About 170 miles southeast, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, two bodies were found inside burned-out homes, Calaveras County Coroner Kevin Raggio says. One of the victims was identified as Mark McCloud, 65, who was found inside his residence in the Mountain Ranch area. Raggio wouldn't release the name of the second victim, also found in Mountain Ranch, because the family had not been notified. Raggio says both were found in an area where mandatory evacuations were ordered after the fire burning 60 miles southeast of Sacramento exploded in size over the weekend. Investigators are looking into whether that blaze was sparked after a live tree came in contact with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. power lines. The deaths came in addition to that of an elderly disabled woman whose body was found Sunday in the ruins of her Lake County home about 100 miles north of San Francisco after what a scientist called a  mind-boggling  blaze.

They're part of the state's Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force, and they banded together to sue the Gwyneth Paltrow-led Goop, reports the Mercury News.

But Eric Abramovitz never saw the acceptance email because then-girlfriend Jennifer Lee, a fellow music student, was spying on his account and saw it first, a court heard this week.

The SNS falls under the auspices of the CDC, which was in 1999 given congressional funding in order to stockpile what now tallies up to $7 billion in inventory: antibiotics, chemical antidotes, vaccines, antitoxins, and other medical items that would be needed in the event of, say, a pandemic flu or chemical-weapon attack in the United States. As for where the SNS warehouses (there are possibly six) are located,  This is not public information,  per a government website, but NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce got a look inside one—after signing a confidentiality agreement that barred her from saying anything about the exterior. Among the things she noticed inside: A massive American flag; a caged area containing potentially addictive drugs; a huge freezer stocked with items requiring colder temps; rows of ventilators that are charged monthly and serviced annually; shipping containers pre-stocked with 50 tons of goods, ready to be sent to local public health officials if needed; and shelves  so tall that looking up makes me dizzy.  One interesting wrinkle: expiration dates. The dates on every item needs to be checked so expired ones can be tossed, meaning vast sums of money are spent on items that will ultimately be discarded. That's not to say the stockpile hasn't been called upon.

Some 20 high school students were killed at the Kintampo waterfalls when a tree or trees (media reports differ on the number) fell at the top of the falls and toppled on them below, an official tells the AFP.  They were swimming in the river when there was a storm, a windy atmosphere that had uprooted some of the trees,  says a national fire service spokesman.

Paul Goodwin, 48, sexually assaulted Joan Crotts in St. Louis County, pushed her down a flight of stairs, and beat her in the head with a hammer. He was a former neighbor who felt Crotts played a role in getting him kicked out of a boarding house. Efforts to spare Goodwin's life centered on his low IQ and claims that executing him would violate a US Supreme Court ruling prohibiting the death penalty for the mentally disabled. Goodwin had an IQ of 73, his attorney says, and some tests suggested it was even lower. Goodwin's sister wrote in a statement that the death penalty  is not a just punishment for his crime—an act that occurred out of passion, not premeditation, by a man with the mental capabilities of a child, not an adult.  But Goodwin's fate was sealed when Gov.

The referendum will be held on June 11 and gives voters two options: statehood or independence/free association. If a majority chooses the latter, a second referendum would be held in October and will ask voters to choose between the two, the AP reports.  Colonialism is not an option for Puerto Rico,  Gov.

"(Apr 19, 2015  7:00 AM CDT) Super-civilizations that conquer entire galaxies may only exist in science fiction, a new study suggests. In the scale of possible civilizations proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, highly advanced Type III civilizations are capable of harnessing the whole power of a galaxy, but a survey of the most promising 100,000 galaxies found no sign of the heat in mid-infrared wavelengths such incredible power would produce.  These galaxies are billions of years old, which should have been plenty of time for them to have been filled with alien civilizations, if they exist,  the lead researcher from Penn State's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds says in a press release.  Either they don't exist, or they don't yet use enough energy for us to recognize them.  The information from NASA's WISE orbiting observatory did, however, reveal 50 galaxies with high enough levels of mid-infrared radiation to merit further study, as well as a few objects the researchers describe as  unstudied and really interesting looking.  And the study definitely does not indicate an absence of alien civilizations: Kardashev III civilizations master entire galaxies, so astronomers in other galaxies using the same method wouldn't be able to detect our civilization even if we had colonized a billion stars. In fact, the lead researcher tells io9, the study suggests that if other civilizations aren't taking over whole galaxies, the Milky Way is still a very good place to keep looking for them.

The Department of Environmental Conservation officers' union and fraternal organization has even raised $15,000, the largest reward in the department's history, reports Newsday, while homicide detectives say they are  open to receiving any new information.  William Becker, who was 43, was a 15-year veteran of the DEC; wife Michelle Becker, 36, owned a beauty salon. Married 17 years, the parents of three had gone to a dinner party in Mattituck that cold winter's night and left shortly before midnight. Police said William's body was found 12 hours later in his forest-green DEC uniform at what was then called Matt-A-Mar Marina with a bump on his head and his arm tangled in electrical cable. By the time Michelle's body was found 40 feet away 20 hours later, her slippers on the dock, police had surmised that the couple had stopped by a friend's boat to  get romantic,  Michelle's brother Michael Malkush says, and that William had died trying to save Michelle, who couldn't swim. But many felt this didn't make sense given their fear of the water, the cold, and their home being so nearby.

Opening statements began Tuesday in the case of 15-year-old Anissa Weier, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Weier's defense is now tasked with convincing 10 of 16 jurors (12 assigned and four alternates) that Weier was delusional at the time of the May 2014 attack and went after Leutner because Weier feared the internet character Slender Man. Weier has pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree homicide, meaning she admits she took part in the attack; this trial will determine if she can be held criminally responsible, which will impact whether she heads to prison or a mental hospital.  Anissa's broken mind caused her to lose touch with reality,  Weier's defense attorney told jurors Tuesday, adding she'd been a loner who developed a  delusional belief system  with co-defendant Morgan Geyser, believing they could become Slender Man's proxies by murdering Leutner, per the AP. Waukesha County Assistant DA Kevin Osborne refuted that, noting Weier had intended to carry out the attack herself but instead instructed Geyser to do it, which he sees as an indication she knew it was wrong. Weier's father took the stand as a defense witness and said while his daughter had gone through rough times during his divorce,  in my opinion, she was a normal child.  Geyser, who's been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has pleaded not guilty to being a party to attempted first-degree homicide and will go to trial Oct. 9.","After 3 Years, 'Slender Man' Trial Begins","After ____ Years, 'Slender Man' Trial Begins",3,Trans( three ),1
"(Dec 27, 2012  9:39 AM) On paper, Tim Cook's total pay fell by around $374 million this year—even though his salary jumped 51%. According to a new regulatory filing, Cook's total compensation for 2012 is valued at $4.17 million, Bloomberg reports. That may not sound like much next to the $378 million he made last year—which was one of the biggest paydays in corporate history—but that's because last year's total included $376.2 million in stock awards that will be doled out gradually over a decade. Cook's figure also looks odd next to COO Peter Oppenheimer's, who received $68.6 million, up from $1.42 million last year. But again, Oppenheimer's package included $66.2 million worth of stock awards. Cook is taking no stock awards this year.",Tim Cook's Salary Jumps 51%,Tim Cook's Salary Jumps ____%,51,Copy( 51 ),0
"(Dec 20, 2012  11:22 AM) The federal government handed Mitt Romney's team millions of dollars to plan a presidential transition that never happened, Freedom of Information Act requests reveal. Romney was the first beneficiary of the Presidential Transition Act of 2010, which provides major party candidates with resources to plan their transitions mid-campaign, Time explains. Backers argued that the bill would improve national security by ensuring the new president was ready to hit the ground running. Romney started availing himself of the funds right after his national convention, and while the final bill hasn't been tallied, the estimated cost is around $8.9 million, including $2.5 million to design and build office space for his transition team, $740,000 worth of furniture, and $5.6 million for computers, cell phones, and other IT needs. The General Services Administration hastens to point out that some of those resources, like the laptops it bought for Romney's 500-member team, would be recycled for future transition teams.",Taxpayers Gave Romney $8.9M to Plan 'Transition',Taxpayers Gave Romney $____M to Plan 'Transition',8.9,Copy( 8.9 ),0
