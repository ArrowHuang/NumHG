"(Dec 28, 2016  3:49 AM) A man who sent his sperm to a Dutch IVF lab may have ended up with many more offspring than he bargained for. In what the University Medical Center in Utrecht says was a  procedural error,  sperm from a single client may have been accidentally used to fertilize the eggs of up to 26 women, AFP reports. Half the women are either pregnant or have already given birth, while the others apparently have the frozen embryos in storage. The center says there's only a small risk that the egg cells  have been fertilized by sperm other than that of the intended father,  but the possibility  could not be excluded.  The center says the deeply unfortunate mix-up happened between mid-April 2015 and mid-November this year and that it  regrets that the couples involved had to receive this news,  the BBC reports. What officials think happened during the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection procedure, in which sperm is injected directly into an egg using a pipette: A technician changed the pipette during each procedure, but used the same rubber top. Eventually, he noticed traces of old sperm in the top, and as the BBC puts it,  raised the alarm.  The center promised the couples involved that it will do everything in its power to provide  clarity  on the issue as soon as possible. The center, which is the only one in the region that provides IVF treatment, has temporarily suspended services but aims to be performing procedures again within days.

When it comes to Super Bowl XLVI, the big money sure has poured in: The commercial slots are officially sold out, at a cost of about $3.5 million for 30 seconds. The no whammies part remains to be seen... The Wall Street Journal reports that, bad economy and all, the price took a big jump over last year's $3 million. And this year's figure represents a 59% increase since 2001, a year in which 30-second commercials ran about $2.2 million. Who can viewers expect to be wowed—or disappointed—by on Feb. 5?

As lifespans have grown, so too have medical efforts to treat the very old, from hip replacements to chemotherapy. But as the New York Times reports, the medical community is divided over both the efficacy and the ethics of surgery for the  late elderly.  One doctor who has studied the repercussions of surgery on much older patients said that people who have reached 100  have demonstrated a survival prowess.  Not everyone agrees: for many medical professionals, such aggressive treatment can be at best wasteful and at worst barbaric, giving false hope to those at the end of their lives.

"(Feb 23, 2014  6:55 AM) Good news for struggling scientists in their mid-30s: Your big breakthrough is probably still to come. So says a new study from the National Bureau of Economics Research, which finds that great scientists and inventors see their biggest moments of genius in their late 30s, the Atlantic reports. Education may explain the phenomenon. Scientists are still studying for degrees until about the age of 30; then they need some time to  learn on the job,  Olga Khazan writes. When they're older, by contrast, they may not keep such close track of the latest developments, making them less likely to strike intellectual gold. Speaking of education, scientists these days have to learn more than they did in the past—which may explain why they peak later now than they did in earlier decades. The study wasn't peer-reviewed, notes io9, so some skepticism may be warranted; it was  circulated for discussion and comment purposes.  As for the humanities, Khazan notes, age may not deplete creativity; after all, Robert Frost wrote 40% of his best poems after age 50, and Paul Cezanne painted his priciest pieces the year he died.",Scientists Peak in Their Late 30s,Scientists Peak in Their Late ____s,30,Copy( 30 ),0

Ciara Romero died after a fall Jan. 4 at the 70-foot Get Air attraction at the Silo Trampoline Park in Grand Junction, the Denver Post reports. The jump requires participants to jump off a tower connected to a rope attached to a harness.

On behalf of the criminal justice system, and I'm sure this means very little to you gentlemen, I'm going to apologize,  a Baltimore Circuit Court judge told Alfred Chestnut, Ransom Watkins, and Andrew Stewart before allowing them to walk free, per the Washington Post. The three had been named by witnesses in a 1984 killing—the first in a Baltimore city school, reports the Baltimore Sun. DeWitt Duckett, 14, was fatally shot for his Georgetown University jacket inside Harlem Park Junior High School on Nov. 18, 1983. High school students Chestnut, Watkins, and Stewart had been hanging around the school before being kicked out at 12:45pm, half an hour before the shooting. Yet four Harlem Park students identified them as the culprits. All four have since recanted their testimony. Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Monday that they had been coached and coerced by authorities despite other witnesses identifying the shooter as 18-year-old Michael Willis, since deceased. One witness saw Willis run from the scene and dispose of a gun. Another heard him confess, and a third saw him wearing a Georgetown jacket hours after the shooting. That information wasn't conveyed at trial. Nor was the fact that the Chestnut's mother had the receipt for a Georgetown jacket found hanging in her son's closet.

It has 90 days to comply or parent company Alphabet could be hit with additional fines of up to 5% of its average daily turnover. Google says it will appeal. The Journal explains that all but about 20% of all smartphones run on the Android operating system, and the allegation was that Google used that dominance as leverage to push its own apps. The Verge outlines the three alleged practices the regulator viewed as illegal and detrimental to competitors, two of which are allegedly still active: that Google stipulated that Android device manufacturers could only incorporate access to Google's Play store if it shipped those devices with the Google Search app and Chrome browser pre-installed, and that it barred manufacturers from using  forked  versions of Android. Bloomberg offers a very clear primer on the issue, starting with how Android became so dominant in the first place and recapping the record fine the EU hit Google with last year. The BBC notes paying the fine wouldn't be a massive blow to Alphabet should it have to pay it; its cash holdings at the end of Q1 were a hair over $100 billion.",Why the EU Just Ordered Google to Pay a $5B Fine,Why the EU Just Ordered Google to Pay a $____B Fine,5,Copy( 5 ),0

Officials in Cook County—which includes Chicago, and is America's second most populous with around 5.2 million people—say the goal is to steer repeat offenders toward treatment instead of jail, the Chicago Tribune reports.  The methods in which we are handling low-level drug cases here in Cook County are simply not working,  State's Attorney Anita Alvarez told NBC, estimating that her office dealt with 15,000 misdemeanor marijuana cases last year. Under the current system,  we continue to see the same individuals revolving in and out of our criminal justice system with no meaningful impact or outcome and at a significant cost to taxpayers,  Alvarez said. The overhaul—which was welcomed by a Chicago police spokesman and the county sheriff's office—also applies to possession of small amounts of drugs including cocaine and heroin, which Alvarez says accounted for around 10,000 of the 40,000 felony cases her office handled last year, the Tribune reports. After she announced the overhaul yesterday, Alvarez said she had no idea of the date's significance for pot smokers, reports the Chicago Sun-Times.  April 20 to me is just that, April 20,  she said.

Authorities say a 14-year-old girl used her parents' credit card—without their permission—to rent out a luxury home for the March 9 party, the CBC reports. Police spokesman Const. Jeff Palmer says that after police received multiple reports of a  major disturbance,  they turned up to find a  swarm  of around 200 young teenagers fleeing the property. Inside, there was  smashed artwork, furniture that was smashed, walls kicked in, furniture and other articles tossed off a balcony into a hot tub, very extensive damage that would take some effort to clean up, let alone repair,  says Palmer, who didn't name the rental service the teen used. The girl told investigators that the party was planned for around 40 people but it rapidly grew out of control. Her family agreed to pay for damage estimated at $20,000, and the homeowner agreed not to press charges, CTV reports. Palmer tells Global News that the incident should send a message  in terms of young people thinking it might be a good idea to have a party at any place where it could be difficult to control who shows up ... to a parent who would want to review how much access to and control of banking information their teenager has.  He says it should also remind people who rent out properties online that they should take steps to determine who's actually showing up to rent the property.

As his parents were divorcing when he was approaching age 8, his mother, Li Chin, sought additional child support for her  high-functioning autistic  son, while a doctor allied with his father, Peter Rodger, called for psychiatric treatment for possible  depression or anxiety.  The mother of one of Rodger's childhood acquaintances showed little surprise at the massacre he perpetrated:  If I could have picked anyone who would have done this, it would have been Elliot,  she says.  He was as withdrawn as any person I ever met in my life,  adds a family friend. Rodger went to three different high schools; at the first two, he reported being bullied. At the second, he was paralyzed by an anxiety attack in the hall and seems never to have gone back. The final school had just 100 students, and some sought to protect Rodger; a staffer called him  our Elliot  upon learning of the shooting spree, the Times reports.

The magazine made its announcement on the Today show. Thunberg, 16, beat out other finalists that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Trump, the Hong Kong protesters, and the whistleblower who triggered the Ukraine scandal that has led to Trump's impeachment. The teen's protests against global warming started out as a solo venture in 2018, when she started skipping school on Fridays to sit outside Sweden's parliament building with a sign that read  School Strike for Climate.  She was soon joined by other students in her hometown, and then across Europe, kicking off what became known as the Fridays for Future movement. She's had quite a journey since. In the nearly year and a half since her first August 2018 protest, Thunberg has  addressed heads of state at the UN, met with the pope, sparred with the president of the United States, and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on Sept. 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history,  per Time. Thunberg has also been candid about having Asperger's syndrome, which she calls  a superpower.

Warren Mitchell tells the Dallas Morning News, noting the shooting occurred  in broad daylight [with] several cars around.  An armed Black male suspect exited a dark sedan on Interstate 35 around 12pm and approached the 28-year-old rapper, who was in his own car, police say, per USA Today. Mo3, real name Melvin Noble, ran from the vehicle but was pursued, police say.

The suspect, who remains at large, also struck a bystander in a vehicle; that victim was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

"(Mar 28, 2014  9:36 AM CDT) Exactly 223 years ago, some of the first British convicts sent to Australia made a daring escape from Britain's penal colony in New South Wales. It has become the stuff of legend, but the tale of what happened on a two-month journey of more than 3,000 miles—in an open boat, no less—has contained  a number of inaccuracies, exaggerations and inventions,  probably due  to the scarcity of first-hand material,  University College London researcher Tim Causer explains. That should no longer be an issue. Though the popular story is based on an edited version of one survivor's account, today, that first-hand account—the only thought to exist in relation to the first convicts deported to Australia in 1788—was released in full for the first time, AFP reports. The story  is often told with a focus upon the figure of Mary Bryant,  Causer notes. To wit, the Australian government presents a bio of Bryant, who was arrested for stealing a cloak and married husband William, also a convict, shortly after getting to the colony. They escaped on March 28, 1791, along with their two children and six others, by stealing the governor's cutter boat. The group paddled Australia's coasts until they landed at the Dutch settlement of Kupang on West Timor. For a time, they tricked their hosts into thinking they were shipwreck survivors, but were shipped back to England when the truth came out; four convicts and the two children died on that part of the trip. The account was likely recorded for survivor James Martin by prison officials upon his return to England, and  it matches up with newspaper accounts and other primary sources,  says Causer, who hopes Memorandoms by James Martin  will help to create a more rounded story.

The storm, which hit the town of Troy shortly before 11pm, caused significant damage to the Walmart roof and destroyed the wall of a nearby sporting goods store. It's unclear how many people were in the Walmart when the tornado hit, but Troy's mayor said it's fortunate the storm struck as late as it did. An 18-wheel truck in the parking lot overturned, and photos on social media showed merchandise strewn in aisles and the ceiling sagging. (See more images at the Troy Messenger. The damage comes ahead of what was expected to be a busy back-to-school shopping weekend for the Walmart, and employees of the store are being given the option to work at other locations while repairs are made.

Vincent, also known as his character  Don Vito,   struggled with kidney and liver issues for a while, and he put up a good fight,  April tells CNN. Vincent was a regular in the original Jackass series on MTV, as well as in the films, and often showed up in his nephew's MTV vehicle, Viva La Bam, from 2003 to 2006, US Weekly reports. In what may be the most oddly slanted obituary of Margera, the Washington Post notes,  He was fat. He was slow. He was often intoxicated, and/or appeared to have a speech impediment. If it was an act, it didn't seem like it. And if he was in on the joke … it didn't seem like it.  Things got worse when a Colorado judge found Vincent Margera guilty in 2007 of two counts of sexual assault against a minor, which led to 10 years' probation, registration as a sex offender, and a ban on him playing Don Vito, Rolling Stone notes. Still, April Margera says he faced his demise with grace.  He said to me last week that he wanted everyone to know it was a good ride,  she tells CNN.  He went through a lot, especially with the Denver stuff. He wanted everyone to know that he never did that.

First, the Republican-led Senate voted to confirm James Mattis to be Defense secretary. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who challenged the idea of a former military leader in a civilian job, voted  no.  Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. Mattis will replace Ash Carter, who has been former President Barack Obama's defense secretary since February 2015. Republicans pushed for fast approval to ensure the post wouldn't be empty even for a brief amount of time after Trump's swearing-in. The Senate also voted convincingly to put a tough-talking retired Marine general in charge of overseeing Trump's pledge to crack down on illegal immigration. Senators confirmed John Kelly's nomination to lead the Homeland Security Department 88-11. Among Kelly's likely first assignments will be executing Trump's plans for the fate of a program that has protected more than 750,000 young immigrants from deportation.

The New York Diocese of Brooklyn says the men, who were abused between the ages of 8 and 12 and are now ages 19 to 21, will receive $6.875 million each under the terms of the settlement, NBC News reports. Angelo Serrano, former director of religious education at St. Lucy's-St. Patrick's Church, was arrested in 2009 after one of the boys told his mother about the abuse. The 67-year-old is currently serving a 15-year sentence. Lawyers for the victims say other boys were severely abused, but  the statute of limitations prevents their claims from being brought.  After the victims sued, the diocese argued that it shouldn't be held responsible for the abuse because Serrano was officially a volunteer, not an employee, even though he received a stipend from the church, the New York Times reports. A judge, however, found that priests and parish workers ignored signs of abuse, including the fact that Serrano regularly had young boys sleep over at his apartment. In a deposition, Father Stephen Lynch admitted that he had seen Serrano inappropriately embrace an 8- or 9-year-old boy and kiss him on the lips.  These were egregious incidences of sexual abuse,  attorney Ben Rabinowitz tells the New York Post.

It looks like the eldest Duggar son, who's married, may have had two paid accounts on the infidelity website between 2013 and 2015, a period during which he worked as the executive director of the conservative Family Research Council lobbying group, Gawker reports, citing evidence including credit card data from a  Joshua J.

Scott Beierle, 40, wrote about that hatred as well as rape, torture, and murder, in his journals, and had a history of misconduct toward females dating back to grade school, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said Tuesday as the department released its final reports, per the Tallahassee Democrat. Beierle's online remarks were also troubling; the wife of a childhood friend notified the FBI about  violent lyrics about murder and stalking  on the amateur musician's website in August. DeLeo called the tip  non-actionable.  And yet, investigators working in the aftermath found Beierle had planned the Nov. 2 shooting for months. He called the studio and searched for a map of its building in August, per CNN. His 9mm handgun was bought in July, a month after Beierle was fired from a teaching job for inappropriately touching a female student. He was fired from another teaching job in 2015 for watching porn, and arrested twice in 2012 for groping women at Florida State University, per the Orlando Sentinel.  Although there was no specific target at the yoga studio …. [his] lifetime of misogynistic attitudes caused him to attack a familiar community,  DeLeo said. Beierle arrived early for the 5:30pm class. Inside the room, he put on earmuffs and pulled out a handgun, fatally shooting FSU student Maura Binkley, 21, and faculty member Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, in the back. Beierle wounded five others, and ultimately shot himself after a confrontation with patron Joshua Quick. Noting he carried more than 100 rounds of ammunition, DeLeo concluded  this could have been even worse than it was.","3 Months Before Yoga Shooting, a 'Non-Actionable' Tip","____ Months Before Yoga Shooting, a 'Non-Actionable' Tip",3,"Subtract( 11 , 8 )",1

"(Apr 13, 2016  2:37 PM CDT) Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group terrorizing Nigeria and surrounding countries, is drastically increasing its use of children as suicide bombers, according to a UNICEF report released Tuesday. The Los Angeles Times reports Boko Haram used four children as suicide bombers in 2014. Last year, they used 44—33 of them girls, whose loose dresses make it easier to conceal bombs. These children, some as young as 8, have killed scores of people in populated areas around Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad. The UNICEF report, Beyond Chibok, is named after an incident that happened two years ago in Chibok, Nigeria, when 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram, according to the Washington Post. Most of them are still missing. Since then, 20% of all Boko Haram suicide bombers have been children. But UNICEF spokesperson Doune Porter says  suicide bomber  is a harmful and inaccurate term when it comes to the children used by Boko Haram.  They’re all very traumatized,  Porter tells the Times.  They have gone through the most awful beatings and rapes. Some of them have been raped by many different people.  She says the children used as bombers are either forced to do it, brainwashed, or are simply too young to understand the consequences. Girls are captured when Boko Haram takes over their villages and forced into sexual slavery. Porter says if they refuse to marry their captors, they are forced to become bombers. All told, the war being waged by Boko Haram has displaced 1.3 million children since 2013.

Now he's honoring her in a big way. The SNL co-head writer took to Instagram Wednesday to announce he was paying a month's rent for 160 residents of his grandmother's public housing complex in New York City.  It's crazy to me that residents of public housing are still expected to pay their rent when so many New Yorkers can't even work,  he wrote. The average monthly rent was $522 as of 2018, per Deadline. Che said the gift  in the spirit and memory of my late grandmother  was  just a drop in the bucket.   I really hope the city has a better plan for debt forgiveness for all the people in public housing, at the very least,  he wrote, calling on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, and rapper Diddy to help  fix this.  He'd announced the death of his grandmother in an April 6 Instagram post, since deleted.

''I've worked hard, so this is what I expect,'' she tells Entertainment Weekly. Hollywood wisdom says female stars fall off the map at 40, to compete for the few eccentric mom roles. But with Devil Wears Prada and Mamma Mia!, Streep has shattered an old belief: that men won't pay to watch a film about a woman. ''She's the hottest actress in America,'' says Nora Ephron, who directed Streep's film, Julie and Julia, slated for release next year. Streep endured bad press for starring in mainstream flicks like She-Devil in the late 1980s, and admits that criticism  still hurts my feelings.''

And not only are Medicaid kids receiving more drugs than their middle-class counterparts, the New York Times reports, but often for less severe conditions. The ramifications are far-reaching: Not only are Medicaid children affected by long-term side-effects of the drugs, both psychological and physical, but antipsychotics represent the system's biggest expense—a staggering $7.9 billion in 2006.

Jim Loewen would like you to know that title actually belongs to our country's 15th leader, James Buchanan. After taking a moment to smack Newsweek for the  cheap sensationalism  of its buzzy cover, Loewen imparts a history lesson.  Buchanan was gay, before, during and after his four years in the White House,  he writes for Salon. And the country was well aware of it. (Not convinced? Consider this line from an 1844 letter Buchanan wrote:  I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.  But Loewen's intention isn't just to give you a new trivia tidbit: It's to explain why Buchanan isn't lauded as such, and what that means. Quite simply, our  touching belief in progress  is the problem.  We must be more tolerant now than we were way back in the middle of the 19th century! Buchanan could not have been gay then, else we would not seem more tolerant now.  Loewen urges us to embrace a more complex national history, one in which  we all moved backward  for about 50 years beginning in 1890, particularly in terms of race relations.  If we can rid ourselves of the fantasy that we are always getting better, then maybe we can create a nation that actually becomes more tolerant,  he writes.

Le Guin  brought literary depth and a tough-minded feminist sensibility to science fiction and fantasy,  the New York Times wrote in its obituary of the author, whose books have been translated into some 40 languages and sold millions worldwide. In an early exploration of gender identity, one of Le Guin's most popular works, The Left Hand of Darkness, takes place on a planet where inhabitants are neither male nor female. The novel was among some 20 of the often femininist-leaning books Le Guin authored over the course of her career. According to EW.com, Le Guin also penned short stories, poetry compilations, and children's books. She was the recipient of a National Book Award, a Hugo, and a Nebula Award. Born in 1929 and raised in Berkeley, Calif., Le Guin was the daughter of anthropologists. She would carry on the academic tradition after undergraduate studies at Radcliffe College, when the LA Times notes she pursued graduate studies in French and Italian literature at Columbia University. Le Guin, née Kroeber, left Columbia after being awarded a Fulbright to study in France, where she would meet her future husband. The two would go on to settle in Portland, Ore.

If you're not sure what kind of cloud you're seeing above your head, consult the World Meteorological Organization's International Cloud Atlas, newly updated just in time for World Meteorological Day on Thursday. The Weather Channel reports that a bunch of new classifications have been added to the atlas (the first fully web-based version) for the first time in three decades, including the volutus  roll cloud  and aforementioned asperitas, as well as human-created cloud types like contrails (the condensation trails left in the wake of airplanes).

Then the classification gets more granular with  species,  which break down the genera clouds further based on shapes, and from there to  varieties,  which indicate transparency and arrangement. The recent additions fall under the species category; there's also a new  supplementary features  section of  unusual parts —such as the aforementioned asperitas, a wavy look to a cloud's underside—and five  special  clouds, including the contrail and clouds formed by waterfall mist.

The sad reason behind it: 8-year-old Delaney Brown, nicknamed Laney, has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia and given only days or weeks to live, the Reading Eagle reports. The carolers in West Reading, Penn, were one of three items on Laney's bucket list; she got to have a video chat with Taylor Swift but couldn't go on a Disney Cruise in her condition. On Saturday, however, she heard the estimated 10,000 carolers through a crack in her house's front door. Amazingly, the carolers well-exceeded the town's population of 4,000. They sang holiday favorites like  Silent Night  and  Joy to the World,  and finished with  Happy Birthday  because Laney turned 8 on Friday. She responded with a thumbs-up photo on her Facebook page—the caption read,  I can hear you now!!! Love you!  Laney has undergone five rounds of radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant, but earlier this week her parents posted the devastating news about her prognosis.

"(Dec 14, 2018  8:10 AM) A powerful jazz vocalist has sung her last song. Nancy Wilson, a three-time Grammy winner and host of NPR's  Jazz Profiles,  died Thursday at her home in Pioneertown, Calif., after a long illness, her manager confirms to NPR. She was 81. Known for telling stories through her music, particularly jazz, Wilson actually dabbled in many genres, from pop to R&B to Broadway show tunes. Born in Ohio, she began testing her pipes at age 4, and was lead singer of her choir by 10, reports the New York Times. Five months after moving to New York in 1959, she'd signed with Capitol Records and put out her first album with Nat King Cole's own producer. Despite no formal training, Wilson went on to release more than 70 albums (including three in a single year), winning the Grammy for best R&B recording in 1964, and two for best jazz vocal album in 2005 and 2007. Her performances of songs like  (You Don’t Know) How Glad I Am  became her signature.  Audiences want to see a song as well as hear it,  as Wilson put it, per the Times.  Part of what I do is in my body language, my hands, my arms. You miss a lot by just hearing my voice.  By 1965, a writer applauded one of her shows as an  extraordinary demonstration of the attainment, by a splendid singer, of an almost unprecedented mixture of commercial appeal, physical and music charm, and artistic integrity.  Two years later, Wilson—a civil rights advocate inducted into the International Civil Rights: Walk of Fame—became one of the first African-American TV hosts, with the Nancy Wilson Show on NBC.  I'm so glad I was able to spend time with her and hear her beautiful voice in person,  John Legend says in a tweet, per CNN.

Researchers studying the Greenland shark estimate the oldest of their 28 specimens is 392 years old, give or take 120 years, Science reports. They tell NPR they're 95% sure Greenland sharks live between 272 and 512 years. That would make the sharks the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, according to Time. The bowhead whale was the previous record holder, living up to 211 years, so even 272 years is a massively long lifespan. The shocked researchers published their findings Thursday. Researchers deduced the shark's age by carbon dating its eyes. National Geographic reports the Greenland shark hadn't been heavily studied in the past due to living in the remote North Atlantic and being hard to find. A geneticist believes the cold water in the sharks' home is responsible for their long lives, slowing their metabolic rates and turning on an anti-aging gene. Meanwhile a biologist specializing in aging is suddenly interested in studying the Greenland shark.  There's something going on in those muscles,  he tells NPR.

And as something of a starving artist, friends counseled her to take it. She countered at $6 million, she says, figuring  I could probably have gotten him up to three,  but ultimately  I was like—ew, gross, you’re disgusting, I don’t want your money, that would make me feel disgusting.

The Defense Department confirms the payments to NBC Dallas/Fort Worth, and explains that it's powerless to stop them: The Military Code of Justice requires Hasan receive his salary; only a guilt verdict can stop that. NBC contrasts that with the case of now-retired Army Spc. Logan Burnett, who was hit three times in the shooting and has since been fighting the Army for money. The Army labeled the shooting an incident of  workplace violence,  and that has big implications: Because it's not using the label  terrorist attack  or describing wounds as  combat related,  NBC explains that Burnett and others wounded that day don't receive the same pay and Purple Heart retirement or medical benefits as those injured in combat or in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.

Israel's Antiquities Authority said Wednesday that an excavation exposed two houses with well-preserved remains and floors containing pottery vessels, flint tools, and a basalt bowl. Ronit Lupo, the authority's director of excavations, says the items are representative of the early Chalcolithic period, around 5,000BC.  Apart from the pottery, the fascinating flint finds attest to the livelihood of the local population in prehistoric times: small sickle blades for harvesting cereal crops, chisels and polished axes for building ... even a bead made of carnelian [a gemstone], indicating that jewelry was either made or imported,  Lupo says, per the Times of Israel. Similar developments have been found elsewhere in present-day Israel but not in Jerusalem. The site was discovered while authorities were doing roadwork in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat. The remains reportedly are up to 2,000 years older than other evidence of human settlements previously found in the area, the Times notes. Lupo says, per the AP, that this  is the first time we found architecture of this kind in Jerusalem itself,  noting that it points to  an established society, very well organized, with settlement, with cemeteries.

Wong slipped onto facility grounds at around 10am, exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy, and then quiet—despite the swarm of law enforcement officers that lay siege and tried contacting him, the AP reports. The bodies were found about eight hours later. As for Wong, he had served three years in the infantry and garnered four medals, including a campaign medal in Afghanistan with two campaign stars.  Like many of our young men (in the military), he did see some rough times,  says a woman who became Wong's legal guardian. Now authorities are trying to digest what happened.

The bombers detonated explosive belts within minutes of each other near the tomb of a prominent Shiite saint, shortly before the start of Friday prayers, as worshipers streamed in to the mosque, a key site for Shiite pilgrims; 25 Iranian pilgrims were among those killed in the blast. The shrine has been a favored target of insurgents, most recently in early April when the a bomb left in a plastic bag near the shrine killed seven people and wounded 23.

The settlement from L-3 Services, which provided the US military with thousands of translators, marks the first time former detainees alleging torture have won a payout from a US defense contractor.

It is possible that the crisis could continue for weeks, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Officials defended their decision to issue the hasty order to abandon homes downstream from the nation's tallest dam, about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco. They said it was necessary for public safety after engineers spotted a hole in an emergency spillway, which they feared could have failed within an hour. The water level of the massive reservoir known as Lake Oroville dropped Monday, slightly easing fears of a catastrophic collapse. But with more storms on the horizon, crews raced to fortify heavily eroded soils where water flowed over the edge of the reservoir and carved huge channels in the earth as it gushed toward the Feather River. The acting head of the state's Department of Water Resources said he did not know if anything had gone wrong and was unaware of a 2005 report that recommended reinforcing the earthen emergency spillway with concrete for just such an event.

"(Nov 20, 2020  7:00 AM) Lisa Montgomery is getting a bit of a break. Montgomery was set to be executed on Dec. 8 in Terre Haute, Ind., which would make her the first woman put to death by the federal government in nearly seven decades. But two of her attorneys last week requested a delay in her execution. In a lawsuit, they stated that the surprise announcement by Attorney General Bill Barr that he'd scheduled the 52-year-old's execution for next month forced them to travel during the pandemic, which caused them both to contract COVID-19. Lawyers Amy Harwell and Kelley Henry say because they've both been bedridden with the virus, they need more time to prepare Montgomery's clemency application. On Thursday, a federal court granted their wish, with an order by US District Judge Randolph Moss mandating that Montgomery can't be executed before the end of 2020, reports NBC News.  It is sufficient for the court to stay plaintiff's execution, briefly  so that the attorneys can recuperate so they can wrap up their clemency petition, Moss wrote in his order. Harwell and Henry are seeking to have the sentence for Montgomery—convicted of strangling a pregnant woman and taking her baby, who survived—commuted to life in prison. Moss noted, however, that the lawyers need to say by Christmas Eve whether or not they can complete said petition on their own; if not, they'll have to recruit other attorneys to help out or have the court do so for them, per the Tennessean.

Per the paper, more than 100 users over a two-year period gave themselves nearly 2,600 injections—drugs used included heroin, meth, prescription opioids, and cocaine. Kral says since the site opened, four people have been saved from overdoses by staff administering naloxone. While the authors note that research shows supervised injection sites cut down on the number of OD deaths, slash the risk of HIV and other diseases from needle sharing, and reduce drug-related crime, law enforcement and community groups are wary. But Kral calls such an illegal site—which the Guardian calls  an act of public health civil disobedience —a needed  innovation.   The whole country knows this is a crisis,  he says.  We need some new solutions.","For 3 Years, Addicts Have Been Shooting Up at Secret US Site","For ____ Years, Addicts Have Been Shooting Up at Secret US Site",3,Trans( three ),1

"(Nov 3, 2012  4:50 PM CDT) A horrific story from western Nepal: Authorities are hunting for a man-eating leopard that may have killed 15 people, including a 4-year-old boy whose head was found in a forest, CNN reports. At most two leopards are behind the attacks, officials say, because man-eating leopards are so rare—and this one is unlikely to stop.  Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer,  says Maheshwor Dhakal, a government ecologist. So far the victims are all women and children in villages that border dense forests, but officials suspect the leopard of killing people in India too. The creature's strategy is simple: drag each victim into a forest and eat everything it can. Only the head—and with adult victims parts of the body—are left behind. Now officials are skirting the law against killing wild animals by offering about $300 to anyone who hunts down the animal.  There is no alternative but to kill the leopard,  says Dhakal.","Wild Leopard Ate 15 Women, Children: Officials","Wild Leopard Ate ____ Women, Children: Officials",15,Copy( 15 ),0

Keith St. Onge said his daughter Zyla could have kept going if the boat hadn't reached the end of the lake. The 30-inch, 20-pound Zyla, who doesn't yet walk, skied across Lake Silver in Winter Haven, Florida, last Thursday. A video of her skiing was posted on YouTube. She stood on tiny water skis that were attached to each other by wood. She gripped a handle bar attached to the skis that looks like a walker someone with mobility problems might use. She wore a life jacket as a boat pulled her at a speed of 7mph. About a dozen adults treaded water on either side of Zyla's path, but the path in the lake ran out of adults as she glided farther away from the shore, at which point she grimaced and let out a few cries. St. Onge pulled the boat's 30-foot line closer and slowed the boat down as Zyla got farther out. When she and the skis sank into the water, he jumped in and was with her in seconds, he said.  She barely, barely got her head wet,  St. Onge said. St. Onge said he realizes some people might not think it's appropriate for someone so young to be water skiing, but he said safety measures were taken and it happened in the controlled environment of a private lake geared for water skiing.

"(Aug 28, 2012  11:08 AM CDT) Mitt Romney seems like the type to pay his debts, but now he's being plagued by one that went unpaid—130 years ago. Author Judith Freeman explained this week in the Los Angeles Review of Books why Romney owes her family $25,000: It seems that, back in the 1870s, Romney's great-grandfather Miles and Freeman's great-grandfather William Jordan Flake were acquainted in Arizona Mormon communities. When both were arrested for polygamy, Flake posted Miles Romney's $1,000 bail. Not only did Miles Romney never repay the debt—he also fled to Mexico, where Mitt's father was eventually born; Flake served six months in prison.  Since it's never too late to make a situation right, and since Mitt Romney seems to have sufficient funds now to cover his ancestor's old debt, I'd like to call upon him to do so,  writes Freeman. She calculates that, without interest, the $1,000 from the 1880s would be around $25,000 today—and she says she's happy to divvy it up between Flake's 15,000 living descendants.

Some rumors say that the robotic mini-space shuttle was interfering with foreign satellites or functioning as a space-based bomber.

This is the third space mission for the Boeing-built craft, which is overseen by the US Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. Space.com notes that while all the plane's landings so far have been at an Air Force base in California, Boeing is retooling an old NASA shuttle hangar for the X-37B.

"(Jul 23, 2013  8:54 AM CDT) Odyssey Marine Exploration has uncovered the biggest load of treasure ever recovered from a shipwreck: 61 tons of silver bullion. The haul was pulled up this month from the SS Gairsoppa, a British cargo ship that sank off the coast of Ireland in 1941 after being torpedoed by a German U-boat. Not only is it the biggest recovery in history, it's also the deepest, coming from a depth of almost three miles, the Tampa Tribune reports. If you can't picture what 61 tons of silver looks like, Bloomberg reports that it's 1,574 silver bars. The Gairsoppa had already yielded almost 48 tons of silver last year, so it has now given up 99% of the insured silver it was reported to be carrying when it sank. Odyssey was hoping to find uninsured silver as well, but did not. Odyssey, a Tampa-based company, won the bidding war to recover the treasure and will retain 80% of the haul. The British government gets the rest. But this haul isn't worth quite as much as last year's, since silver prices have gone down recently.

Kevin Howard won the lawsuit against the other man under the state's  alienation of affection  law, which allows spouses to sue somebody who has  purposefully interfered  with their marriage. Howard tells CNN that the case was about a lot more than money.  I believe in the sanctity of marriage,  he says.  Other families should see what the consequences are to not only breaking the vow to whatever religion you subscribe to, but also your legal responsibilities.  He says the other man was one of his wife's work colleagues, and he had considered him a friend. Howard says his wife initially told him she wanted to separate because he worked too much. He tried marriage counseling, but later became suspicious and hired a private investigator, who uncovered the affair. His attorney, Cindy Mills, tells WITN that the other man laughed when he was told about the lawsuit.  That defendant now has a $750,000 judgment against them, so I don't think he's laughing now,  she says. Mills says she has handled around one such case every year over the last 30 years, and won a $5.9 million judgment in a 2010 case.

The latest finds at the ancient wreck dubbed the  Titanic of the ancient world  include a bone flute, a bronze armrest that may have come from a throne, glassware, fine ceramics, and a piece from an ancient board game.  This shipwreck is far from exhausted,  a marine archaeologist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution says in a press release.  Every single dive on it delivers fabulous finds, and reveals how the '1%' lived in the time of Caesar.  The wreck, which dates from around 65BC, was found by sponge divers off a Greek island in 1900 and Woods Hole says it is carrying out the first systematic excavation of the site, using information gathered by a robotic submersible last year, UPI reports. In fact, it's one of the biggest underwater archaeological projects in the world, notes New Scientist. The institute says that over the last month, good weather helped teams make more than 60 dives to the wreck's large debris field.  We were very lucky this year, as we excavated many finds within their context, which gave us the opportunity to take full advantage of all the archaeological information they could provide,  an institute archaeologist says. One key, as New Scientist explains, is that divers have discovered they need to dig deeper into the ocean floor. One of the last searches of the year using this technique yielded a wine jug, small bronze pieces, and possibly part of a cooking pot. But researchers say they think far more significant finds await when next year's expedition begins.  There’s obviously stuff down there,  says one.  We just weren’t digging deep enough before.

Reuters and the South China Morning Post report that UK judge Charles Haddon-Cave has ordered Russian oligarch Farkhad Akhmedov to sign over the 380-foot Luna to his 41-year-old wife as part of a $635 million divorce settlement Cave awarded her in 2016—nearly 42% of Akhmedov's fortune, and said to be the largest British divorce settlement of all time. (The couple moved from Russia to London in 1993, where Akhmedova has lived ever since and raised their two sons.) And it's some boat Akhmedova will soon be docking: a nine-deck expedition yacht with 50 crew members, two helipads, a 65-foot swimming pool, a mini-submarine, and even an anti-missile system. The new court order comes after Akhmedova says she never received any money from the settlement, with Cave noting it appeared the 62-year-old Akhmedov had taken  elaborate steps to conceal his wealth and evade enforcement of the judgment,  per the London Times. Akhmedov said he'd sold the yacht back in 2014, but it turned out the firm he'd sold it to was simply one of his own offshore companies, and Akhmedova's attorneys eventually tracked the yacht down in dry dock in Dubai, where it remains under court order.

People don’t feel it getting better yet,  Geithner conceded. But Geithner defended the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which has about $124 billion left, saying the market is starting to heal.

"(Mar 19, 2014  10:46 AM CDT) A lack of shut-eye may not just leave you feeling groggy—it could seriously injure your brain. A new study of mice has found 25% of brain cells died off after prolonged sleep loss, meant to duplicate night shifts or long hours at the office—the first evidence of its kind and a scary find if it applies to humans.  We now have evidence that sleep loss can lead to irreversible injury,  a researcher told the BBC, noting that when the mice lost a little sleep, they were protected by an energizing protein, but brain cells began to die off when sleep loss became a habit.  This suggests to us that we are going to have to look very carefully in humans.  If you don't get the recommended six to eight hours of sleep per night but substitute extra hours of snores later to catch up—like on weekends—that may not make up the difference either, researchers say, as the damage may already be done, CNN notes. While more research is needed—the group plans to study the brains of shift workers after death to look for nerve damage—there may also be a silver lining to look forward to: The team notes its research may eventually lead to medicines that help people deal with irregular sleep patterns caused by odd work hours.",Lack of Sleep Can Fry 25% of Brain Cells,Lack of Sleep Can Fry ____% of Brain Cells,25,Copy( 25 ),0

Boaters off Long Island and Connecticut have been capturing images of belugas, humpbacks, and at least one minke starting in May, when three belugas were seen near Fairfield, Conn. But while the creatures provide perfect photo ops (especially breaching humpbacks), NOAA warns people to keep their distance, the AP notes. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, only one boat can come within 300 feet of a whale, and even then only for 15 minutes, NBC Connecticut reports; it also must reduce speed and tell other boats about the sighting. (An  Ocean Etiquette  guide by NOAA Fisheries offers more tips. The biggest question, though, has yet to be definitively answered: Why did the whales return to the Sound after such a long break? Experts believe baitfish-harvesting restrictions and less rainfall (which reduces polluted runoff from entering the waters) may have drawn the whales back, per the AP. The whale expert cited in the Hour adds that a whale who's hurt or sick may also sometimes enter strange waters. Whatever the reasons, local boaters are thrilled.  I was having heart palpitations I was so excited,  one tells the AP, while another says he was double-teamed off Stamford, Conn.:  I know for certain that there was more than one whale because the breaching one started to scare me and breached behind the boat while the other whale was in front.

It arrived three weeks ago. Berinstein says he was surprised when a package from online retailer Well.ca turned up on his doorstep May 6.  I was very confused because I hadn't ordered anything from Well.ca in awhile,  he tells the CBC.  And then I remembered one time about eight years ago I ordered something from them.  He says he decided against using the Brylcreem after he opened the tube.  It was bright yellow,  he said.  When I Googled it, it was supposed to be pretty white, so I didn't try it out.

While the skills of some Air Force officers at a North Dakota base may not seem like something that would have major implications at first blush, know this: These officers have the authority to control—and, if necessary, launch—a nuclear missile; the Air Force has now stripped that authority from an unprecedented 17 of them on the heels of the previously unpublicized failings. The AP explains that the  tip-off  to the trouble came during a March inspection at the facility, where two officers stand  alert  at all times in each of the underground launch control capsules, ready to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile upon presidential order. The Air Force publicly called it a  success ; in reality, the 91st Missile Wing earned the equivalent of a  D  grade when tested on its mastery of Minuteman III missile launch operations. Seventeen of its 150 officers were told they  will be a bench warmer for at least 60 days  in an internal email sent by the group's deputy commander and obtained by the AP, which reports that it's the biggest ever sidelining of launch crew members. Though the Air Force says security was never compromised and that the officers will return to duty after completing additional training, the AP asserts that the email—which spoke of  rot in the crew —reflects a culture of indifference.

That's the plight of 23-year-old Rivka, 22-year-old Tziporah, 18-year-old Tzvi, and 15-year-old Racheli Herzfeld, four siblings from Teaneck, NJ, who are fighting what Fox News calls a  mystery illness  that's weakening their muscles and progressively robbing them of their ability to walk, as well as plunging their family into at least $100,000 in debt. What makes it even more frightening is that doctors haven't pegged exactly what the disease is, notes the Record, despite many tests over the past decade.  It is a little bit concerning that we've done all this testing and still cannot really figure out what it is,  one of the geneticists who's worked with the family tells Fox. The Herzfelds' mom, Esther, says the kids  were all just … normal and fine, and seemingly healthy  when they were born and were active and played sports as they got older. But when Tziporah was 11, she started falling in gym class, and a neurologist initially diagnosed her with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited disorder. Her brother and sisters also eventually started exhibiting symptoms, but tests for CMT on all four came back negative. Students at the school where Esther teaches found out about their predicament and started crowdfunding to raise money for a customized van, home renovations, and medical bills for the Herzfelds; a local synagogue and others have also helped financially. In the meantime, despite their condition—the girls walk slowly and carefully because they can't get up if they fall, and Tzvi now uses a motorized wheelchair—the kids remain determined to find some answers.

The daunting numbers mean that the government will have to borrow 40 cents for every dollar it spends. The latest figures are up from previous estimates because of bipartisan legislation passed in December that extended Bush-era tax cuts, unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless, and provided a 2% payroll tax cut this year. That measure added almost $400 billion to this year's deficit, CBO says. The CBO analysis predicts the economy will grow by 3.1% this year, but that joblessness will remain above 9% this year.

At the top of her game, Williams broke Wozniacki's serve five times and compiled a hard-to-believe 29-4 edge in winners. Remarkably, until a cross-court backhand on the run in the final game that even Williams applauded, the only winners registered by the 10th-seeded Wozniacki came on a trio of aces, one in the first set, two in the second. That was, in part, a result of the Dane's iffy play in only her second Grand Slam final—she lost to Kim Clijsters at the 2009 US Open—but more due to Williams' relentless pursuit of every ball. Williams has now equaled Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova with 18 major singles titles, the fourth-most in history. Williams also matched Evert's total of six championships at the US Open and became the first woman to win three in a row since Evert's four-title run from 1975-78.

The manager for Paul Revere and the Raiders says Revere died from cancer at his home in Garden Valley, Idaho, over the weekend.  He'd been quiet about it for some time,  the manager says.  Treated at the Mayo Clinic, Paul stayed on the road as long as he could, then retired recently back to Idaho.  Revere, born Paul Revere Dick, became known as  the madman of rock and roll  for his theatrical Colonial wardrobe and infectious onstage persona with the band, which served as the house band for the Dick Clark TV show Where the Action Is. The group became popular in 1963 with its rendition of Richard Berry's  Louie, Louie  before releasing its own hits, such as  Kicks,  ''Hungry,  and  Good Thing.  The band's biggest smash came in 1971 with  Indian Reservation.  While the band's lineup changed over the past 50 years, Revere remained a constant presence with the group and continued touring until earlier this year.  I don't want to get into the details, but let's just say, it ain't fun,  he said last year of his battle with cancer.

Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say.  The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did,  a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would  without a doubt  have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the Pyles had a tradition of extending Christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree  lit most of the time,  WBAL reports.

The last such find was in early 2016, when two feet from the same person washed up separately. When the feet started to wash up, there were fears that they could belong to victims of a disaster or even a serial killer. Authorities later identified eight of 12 feet as belonging to people who died in accidents or suicides. They believe the feet naturally separated from the bodies after a long period in the water.

In a rare case of  thunderstorm asthma,  strong winds near Melbourne on Monday sent massive amounts of rye grass pollen into the air, making it difficult for many to breathe, reports the BBC. Ambulance Victoria took more than 1,870 calls—six times the daily average—in just five hours during the storm, including 800 related to asthma or respiratory issues. One 15-minute span averaged a call every 4.5 seconds, reports 9News.  It was extraordinarily busy, it was unprecedented,  a rep says, adding that many calls came from people who  had never had asthma before.

Detroit police Chief James Craig said officers found 36 fetuses in boxes and 27 others in freezers during Friday's raid at the Perry Funeral Home. He said he was  stunned  by the discovery, which came a week after the remains of 10 fetuses and one infant were discovered in a ceiling at Detroit's defunct Cantrell Funeral Home. Those remains were found after state regulators in Lansing received an anonymous letter. Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said the remains found at the Perry Funeral Home were turned over to state investigators, who immediately declared the funeral home closed and its license suspended, per the AP. Inspectors said in a statement that they had found  heinous conditions and negligent conduct  at the Perry Funeral Home, including numerous failures to certify death certificates and obtain proper permits for burial. The statement said Friday's findings point clearly toward criminal offenses  punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not more than $50,000 or both.  Craig said the investigation into the Perry Funeral Home began after a man who has sued that business over its handling of remains of infants and fetuses saw coverage of the discoveries at the Cantrell Funeral Home and told his attorney to contact police. (Authorities believe at least one of the Cantrell fetuses had been on the property since 2009.)",'Stunned' Cops Find 63 Fetuses Stashed in Funeral Home,'Stunned' Cops Find ____ Fetuses Stashed in Funeral Home,63,Copy( 63 ),0
"(Mar 25, 2014  2:42 PM CDT) The Copenhagen Zoo has another controversy on its hands over its treatment—more precisely, its killing—of animals. The zoo, which drew outcries several weeks ago when it killed a healthy giraffe and dissected it publicly, killed four lions this week to make way for an incoming adult male lion, reports AFP. The zoo put down two aging females whose place as primary breeders will be taken by two younger females, along with two 10-month-old cubs who would have been killed by the new male anyway, say zoo officials. It's all about  the pride of lions' natural structure and behavior,  they say. The zoo hopes the new male and two younger females will form a new pride, reports AP. This time around, no public dissection will take place because  not all our animals are dissected in front of an audience,  says a zoo spokesperson.

The company is recalling all 4.7 million models on the market because of reports of fatalities, reports USA Today. A notice on the Consumer Product Safety Commission website lays it out with a telling stat:  Since the 2009 product introduction, over 30 infant fatalities have occurred in Rock ‘n Play Sleepers, after the infants rolled over while unrestrained, or under other circumstances.  Last week, the company and the CPSC issued a warning that parents should stop using the sleeper when their child reaches 3 months or is capable of rolling over, but that was criticized as too lax. On Monday, Consumer Reports published an investigation in which it concluded that the sleeper needed to be recalled.  At least 32 babies have died while in the sleeper. Why is it still on the market?  asked its headline. After the CR report, the American Academy of Pediatrics echoed the demand for a recall. A big issue, according to the CR investigation, is that babies should sleep on their back on firm, flat surfaces to reduce the risk of suffocation. The sleeper has soft bedding and is on an incline.

Six-year-old Etan Patz vanished on his way to a Manhattan bus stop in 1979. A huge search was mounted, and Patz became the first missing child ever to be shown on a milk carton, but no trace of him was ever found.

According to the Fairfield Citizen, Carol Cardillo, who runs a home daycare, gave Adam Seagull a bottle, then put him down for a nap March 22. She called 911 three hours later when she couldn't wake the baby. It was revealed following Adam's death that Cardillo had been running the daycare without a license for 11 years. Adam had no apparent signs of trauma and hadn't been sick when he died, leading investigators to originally believe he died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, People reports. But a toxicology report found elevated levels of Benadryl in Adam's system. The FDA warns against giving the medication to children under 2 years old as there is a high risk of overdose. Fairfield police chief Gary MacNamara calls Adam's death a  parent's worst nightmare.  No charges have been filed, but MacNamara says that will change.  The consumption of the medication wasn't accidental,  MacNamara tells People.  I am not saying there was intent to kill the baby, but as a result of that Benadryl, this child died.

So University of Tennessee professor emeritus Richard Jantz used modern quantitative techniques, including a computer program that estimates sex, ancestry, and stature from bone measurements, to analyze the bones. Well, technically he only analyzed the measurements of the bones, as the actual bones were lost sometime after 1940. He also compared the measurements to a photo of Earhart and some of her surviving clothing. Jantz found the bones are closer to Earhart than they are to 99% of people included in a sample.  If the bones do not belong to Amelia Earhart, then they are from someone very similar to her,  the study states. Jantz concludes Earhart likely died as a castaway on Nikumaroro.

Officials say 21 people were hospitalized there, one critically, and crews responded to over a dozen houses that contained trapped people, per ABC News. At least 30 injuries have been reported, but no fatalities. Illinois averages 47 tornadoes annually, usually peaking in May, but a strong cold front set up  the perfect conditions  for Saturday's blitz, says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Tornadoes have been moving east in recent decades from Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas to states on and east of the Mississippi River—including Illinois, the AP reports. Sadly, that means tornadoes are forming more often in more populated areas. Why the change?  We don't know,  says Victor Gensini, who lead a study on the subject.  This is super consistent with climate change.  Seems the Great Plains are drying out, providing less moisture to create storms that trigger tornadoes, while a line of dry, tornado-producing air is moving east.

I have been through bad times like you,  the letter read.  But remember, Tough times never last, Tough people do.  After Ruffin posted the note on Reddit, comments began pouring in lauding the kind gesture, some sharing similar stories of generosity and others saying they had been inspired to donate their own old instruments to students in need.

The nearly 250-page document from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure lays out design, regulatory, and management missteps and  disturbing cultural issues,  including placing  undue pressure  on employees. The two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, and which prompted the grounding of the plane in March of last year,  were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA,  the report reads. The Democrat-led committee's report, which the New York Times says came from 600,000 pages of records and interviews with dozens of Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration workers, accuses the FAA of not stepping in enough to provide oversight, and Boeing of prioritizing profits over safety—specifically so that it could stay on top of rival Airbus, which had a competing aircraft. In a statement cited by CNN, Boeing responded to the report by saying it has  learned many hard lessons as a company  and that once regulators give the plane the OK to fly again,  we have full confidence in its safety.

"(Aug 8, 2017  12:11 PM CDT) The CDC statistic is a harsh one: Ninety-one Americans die from opioid overdoses—that number includes heroin and prescription opioids—every day. A University of Virginia researcher claims we're undercounting. A new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine estimates that opioid- and heroin-related mortality rates were 24% and 22% greater than reported between 2008 and 2014. Dr. Christopher Ruhm arrived at those figures after reviewing thousands of death certificates for those who suffered a fatal overdose during that period, reports NBC News. This issue involves the death certificates themselves. States like Vermont, Virginia, and South Dakota identified the specific drug more than 95% of the time. But in states like Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Mississippi, that figure didn't quite hit 50%. Overall, in 2008, no drug was identified 25.4% of the time; in 2014, it was 19.5%. And so Ruhm used statistical analysis to estimate how many of those deaths would have been from heroin and opioids; the University of Virginia explains Ruhm compared high- and low-reporting certificates from areas with similar demographics to do so. One big takeaway, per Ruhm, is that some states have more severe problems than thought. He points to Pennsylvania, which the CDC lists as 32nd among the 50 states for opioid deaths in 2014; Ruhm's study puts it at No. 7. His study didn't knock West Virginia from the No. 1 slot, but it did up its opioid death rate by about 1.3%.

"(Dec 2, 2016  5:25 PM) Wildlife officials in Florida have known for a while that Burmese pythons have been eating their way through the Everglades, but the study of one particular snake has surprised them with the extent of that appetite: The 15-foot female had eaten three white-tailed deer in the 90 days before her capture, reports Live Science. Researchers found the remains of an adult doe and two fawns in the snake's intestines, they report in Bioinvasions Record. (They titled the report  Supersize Me. ) That's a relatively short time for a snake to put down three big meals, notes study co-author Scott Boback.  If a python is capable of eating three deer in three months,  he marvels, then it clearly raises serious questions about the pythons' impact on the Everglades ecosystem.  We don't even know how many of them are out there.  What scientists do know is that ever since the Burmese python first surfaced in the area in the 1980s—the reason is unclear, but careless pet owners are generally blamed—the population numbers of raccoons, rabbits, foxes, and other mammals have plummeted.  All these studies are putting together a story that we just can’t ignore anymore,  Boback tells Vox, which takes a more in-depth look at the implications of the python invasion.

"(Jan 13, 2019  10:11 AM) Three German skiers were killed in an avalanche in Austria and a fourth is still missing, police said Sunday as snowfall set in again in the northern Alps. In France, two ski patrollers were killed when the devices they use to trigger avalanches exploded. The two accidents brought to at least 26 the number of weather-related deaths reported in parts of Europe this month. The bodies of the German skiers, aged 57, 36, and 32, were recovered Saturday evening near the ski resort of Lech. Police in Vorarlberg, Austria's westernmost province, had to call off the search for another missing German skier in the group, age 28, because of heavy snow and risk of avalanches. Police said the four friends had skied onto a closed trail. Although they had avalanche protection equipment and deployed airbags, they were buried by the snow and suffered multiple injuries.

"(Jan 9, 2016  4:05 PM) At least 231 members of a Catholic boys' choir in Germany were physically abused over four decades—largely while the choir was conducted by the brother of former Pope Benedict XVI, the New York Times reports. That number comes from Ulrich Weber, a lawyer hired by the Regensburger Domspatzen choir to investigate abuse allegations that arose in 2010, according to AFP. Previously, the local Catholic Diocese had capped the number of victims at 72 and offered $2,700 in compensation, the Times reports. According to AFP, the abuse—which included  severe beatings and food deprivation —started as early as 1945 and lasted until 1992. Weber says at least 40 of the 231 cases are instances of sexual abuse, including rape, the Times reports. Some victims spoke of up to 10 adults abusing young members of the 1,000-year-old choir, with one former member describing a  system of sadistic punishments connected to sexual pleasure,  AFP reports. Weber estimates that one-in-three choir members were abused in one way or another, according to the Times. He says most of that abuse was at the hands of the director of a school attached to the choir. Rev. Georg Ratzinger—the older brother of the former pope—conducted the choir from 1964 to 1994, and Weber says he  must assume  Ratzinger knew about the abuse. Ratzinger was on the board overseeing the school's director, and there was an investigation into abuse in 1987. Weber says there are likely more victims who haven't come forward.

But doctors in Lima, Peru, finally removed the cancerous growth—which had developed into a 35-pound mass—from the 22-year-old woman during a Feb. 20 surgery, and they're optimistic she's well on her way to recovery, Reuters reports.  The tumor was approximately [19.6 inches] in diameter,  Dr. Luis Garcia Bernal, the director of Archbishop Loayza National Hospital, says of the growth removed during the 3-hour-plus procedure.  It's as if she were pregnant, but twice the size.  It was a day Rojas believed wouldn't ever come.  I never thought I would be operated on,  Rojas said in a Health Ministry statement, per CNN.  I'm happy now because I'm recovering.  And likely because she no longer has to lug around the abdominal ball and chain she discovered in her early teens, which has made everyday life no easy task.  I couldn't work or study with the tumor,  Rojas said, per Medical Daily.  I just stayed at home.  The moment that changed her fate: a chance meeting with the Peruvian health minister, who happened to visit the remote Peruvian town where Rojas lives and immediately had her taken to Lima once he found out about her situation. Garcia Bernal tells CNN that the tumor was a low-intensity ovarian tumor, meaning chemo won't be needed, and that 90% of his patients who have that kind of growth fully recover. So what are Rojas' plans now that she's been relieved of her cancerous burden? She hopes to study accounting, Fox News reports.

He's not alone: On Thursday, CNN reports, Delta said its no-fly list has about 240 names on it.  Although rare, we continue to put passengers who refuse to follow the required face-covering rules on our no-fly list,  its CEO told employees in a memo. The policy requires that masks be worn from check-in, through the boarding gate area, and onto the plane—even in the Delta Sky Clubs—to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.

More than 3,200 years later, it's once again standing in Egypt, thanks to archaeologists who reassembled its 89 sizable pieces and many smaller fragments. Its 121 tons now lord over those who pass the northern gate of his funerary temple in the city of Luxor.

As part of its Christmas Book of fantasy gifts, the department store chain is offering a  Holiday Turkey Dinner  for $495 plus shipping, complete with a 12-pound roast turkey, gravy, stuffing, soup, salad, bread pudding, bread, and butter. The fancy feast may seem, um, a tad overpriced given that the average Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people cost $50.11 last year, reports KDVR. But it's the add-ons in particular that have ruffled Twitter users. For $80 plus $18 shipping you can also get baked beans, while three pounds of frozen collard greens with bacon (now sold out) cost $66 plus $15.50 shipping, report NPR and the Washington Post. Collard greens are what Eater calls a  value vegetable,  selling for as little as $2.63 per pound in grocery stores, per Us Weekly. At such a high price, Neiman Marcus' version  better taste like unicorn tears and Prince's bath water,  the Root quips in a tweet. But the fact that Neiman Marcus chose to include bacon in its greens is also a matter of contention as the dish is traditionally made in the South with ham hocks or smoked meat.

But they must be safer. And we will not rest until they are.  Year-to-year declines in highway deaths have occurred in previous economic downturns, when fewer people are out on the road, but last year's reduction in fatalities came even as the estimated number of miles traveled by motorists in 2009 increased 0.2% over 2008 levels.",Highway Deaths Drop to 60-Year Low,Highway Deaths Drop to ____-Year Low,60,"Subtract( 2010 , 1950 )",1

Ricky Jackson, 57, was dismissed from the Cuyahoga County Jail and walked out of the adjoining courthouse this morning about an hour after a judge dismissed his case. The dismissal came after the key witness—then a 13-year-old boy—at trial against Jackson and brothers Wiley and Ronnie Bridgeman recanted last year and said Cleveland police detectives coerced him into testifying that the three killed businessman Harry Franks on the afternoon of May 19, 1975.

"(Jul 3, 2013  7:43 AM CDT) The two men who saw HIV seemingly vanish from their blood after getting bone marrow transplants to treat their blood cancer are still apparently virus-free and feeling  great —weeks after they stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs. Researchers gave the encouraging update today at the International AIDS Society Conference in Malaysia, but doctors are being careful not to use the word  cured,  since the men have been off drugs a relatively short period of time: seven and 15 weeks, respectively.  If these patients are able to stay without detectable HIV for at least a year, maybe a year and a half, after we stop treatment, then the chances of the virus coming back are very small,  a lead researcher tells AFP. Their blood is being tested weekly, and even their intestinal tissue, where HIV seemingly hides, has been tested, the Boston Globe reports. But  HIV could still be hiding in the brain, gut, or lymph nodes,  warns the study leader. Of course, as the New York Times puts it, the news is of  no practical use  to most of the people suffering from HIV around the world. The transplant procedure is extremely dangerous, and can only be ethically used on someone already at risk of dying from blood cancer. (In fact, the third patient in the study died after his cancer returned.) Even so, the results are encouraging, and could inform attempts to genetically re-engineer HIV patients' cells; two teams are apparently working on this. The case is similar to that of Timothy Ray Brown, who was apparently cured of HIV following a bone marrow transplant, but he had leukemia (these patients had Hodgkin's lymphoma) and he received marrow containing a mutation that protects against HIV (these patients did not). More encouraging news from the conference: The HIV-positive baby who was put on anti-retrovirals when she was just days old is still free of the virus, 15 months after stopping treatment.","2 Men With HIV Are Off Drugs, Seem Virus-Free","____ Men With HIV Are Off Drugs, Seem Virus-Free",2,Trans( two ),1

The New York Times details some of what brought on the 24-hour ban against Yair Netanyahu, 27, who posted that Iceland and Japan are free from attacks because  coincidentally there are no Muslims  in those countries, and that he wished there was an Israel without Muslims. The only way there will be peace in Israel, he wrote, per Al Jazeera, is if  all Jews leave [Israel] or all Muslims leave,  and  I prefer the second option.  The younger Netanyahu also lashed out after the death last week of two Israeli soldiers at the hands of a Palestinian, noting he hoped their deaths would be  avenged  and that  there will never be peace with the monsters in human form known since 1964 as 'Palestinians.'  After being informed that he was temporarily blocked, Netanyahu took to Twitter to repost what he wrote on Facebook and accuse the latter site of  mind dictatorship,  as well as of hosting  endless pages that call for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews.

But that's not all. A confidential report prepared by independent UN monitors and seen by Reuters on Friday also states North Korea supplied weapons—including ballistic missile systems—to Syria and Myanmar. UN monitors say they found 15 shipments of coal from North Korea to Russia, China, South Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam that violated UN caps on North Korean coal exports between January and August of last year. They say they found another 23 shipments in potential violation following the UN outright banning North Korean coal exports on Aug. 5. The report to the UN Security Council's sanctions committee states these shipments were mostly made by doctoring paperwork to show the coal came from Russia or China. So far, no country named has fessed up to accepting improper coal shipments. The UN monitors also say they investigated 40 unreported shipments from North Korea to Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which is in charge of Syria's chemical weapons program, between 2012 and 2017.

"(Sep 19, 2016  9:47 AM CDT) For more than 50 years, scientists have been gathering foxes from the Russian wilderness and breeding them, picking the most human-friendly to mate to domesticate the supposedly untamable animals, much as dogs once were, Phys.org reports. And it looks like the project the BBC says was started by Dmitry Belyae and his intern, Lyudmila Trut, has been a success: By the fourth generation of foxes, the animals were acting much like socialized dogs, wagging their tails and seeking human contact, and they'd physically changed, too, with droopier ears, shorter legs and snouts, and higher serotonin levels, which may have dampened aggressiveness. In the late 1950s Belyae and Trut set out to domesticate a species from the ground up—in a country that Live Science notes banned the study of genetics in 1948, with severe punishments for those who flouted the law. In the beginning, the researchers pretended they were breeding foxes for their fur (and they did kill for fur those foxes that weren't docile enough to continue mating for their real experiment). What's interesting is that the foxes on the farm weren't  tamed,  per se, which is learned behavior not passed down to the next generation, Popular Science explained in 2013. Rather, a 2009 paper by Trut (Belyae died in 1985, and Trut, now in her 80s, has been running the project since) notes that the meticulously selective breeding led to the neurological and endocrinal changes the foxes underwent, per Discover. Now that the foxes have been domesticated, Trut's next task is to isolate the genes that are altered during this process.

"(Feb 15, 2016  8:18 AM) Some 14,000 life jackets discarded by refugees entering Europe via the Greek island of Lesbos now adorn the six pillars of Berlin's landmark Konzerthaus concert hall. It's the work of Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei, Quartz reports, who has been a vocal critic of Europe's handling of the refugee crisis. Since January, more that 84,000 migrants have arrived in Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration. Of those, at least 410 have drowned or are missing. More than 1 million migrants made the journey to Europe in 2015, with the vast majority of them coming by sea. More than 3,700 people died crossing the Mediterranean last year, per Quartz. Officials in Lesbos say they gave the life jackets to Ai, CNN reports. The artist has spent a lot of time on the island in the last year—even setting up a studio there—documenting the dangerous journey refugees make as they flee conflict and poverty.  As an artist, I have to relate to humanity’s struggles,  he tells the AP in an earlier interview.  I never separate these situations from my art.  Recently, Ai recreated the photo of the Syrian toddler who drowned and washed ashore on a Turkish beach in September during his family's failed attempt to reach Greece, the Guardian adds.  It's an idea that came quite spontaneously,  he tells CNN.  We had talked about the image of the boy, so I had that on my mind.

"(Feb 26, 2015  8:43 AM) Police in Washington state are releasing more details in the controversial police killing of a Mexican orchard worker in Pasco on Feb. 10. Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was allegedly throwing rocks at passing cars and then at police officers, but video of the incident appears to show him running away from officers before being shot. Now a spokesman for the task force investigating the shooting says the three officers involved fired at Zambrano-Montes a total of 17 times, five or six of those shots hit him, and none of them hit him in the back, NBC News reports. The spokesman also says that before the shootings a Taser was used at least twice. The spokesman also confirmed that though a rock was found near Zambrano-Montes' body, no gun or knife was found, the AP reports. The Mexican government has criticized the use of deadly force in the case, the ACLU has asked the Justice Department to get involved in the investigation, and residents of Pasco—where the population is more than 50% Latino—are protesting. A local Latino group also wants a federal investigation of the incident. The ACLU notes that this was the fourth fatal shooting by Pasco police in six months, NBC reports, but the AP notes that similar investigations into the first three incidents resulted in the officers involved being exonerated.",Cops Shot at Rock-Throwing Man 17 Times: Inquiry,Cops Shot at Rock-Throwing Man ____ Times: Inquiry,17,Copy( 17 ),0
"(Jun 19, 2017  6:04 PM CDT) A homeowner outside Pittsburgh, Penn., has a rather jolting daily reminder of a construction mistake he made nearly 13 years ago. CBS Pittsburgh reports that Jerry Lynn of Ross Township accidentally dropped an alarm clock between the walls during a home improvement project in the fall of 2004. Though it’s been 13 years, the clock beeps every evening at 6:50pm (unless it's daylight saving time, when the beeping starts an hour later). Back in 2004, Lynn set the alarm for 10 minutes later, then lowered the clock through a second-floor vent via a string. The plan was for the alarm to go off, once lowered to the first floor, as a signal for where Lynn needed to drill a hole through his living room wall for a TV hookup. Instead, the clock detached from the string, leaving Ross unable to lift it back through the vent.  As I was laying it down, all of a sudden I heard it go ‘thunk’ as it came loose,  he says, adding that he figured  maybe three, four months, it’ll run out of battery.  But the clock has been ticking faithfully since, with a distinctive beep that can be heard in CBS Pittsburgh's video around the :25 second mark. Though the Lynn family has grown accustomed to the daily alarm, Jerry’s wife Sylvia told CBS Pittsburgh that it still throws off guests.  It starts with a soft ‘beep, beep, beep, beep,’ and it gets louder and closer together.

But it looks like Flint is moving on with or without him: On Tuesday, Mayor Karen Weaver announced a $55 million public works project that will replace all of the city's water pipes, and the process will begin within a month, the Detroit Free Press reports.  All lead pipes need to be replaced,  Weaver said at a press conference, per WDIV.  We deserve new pipes because we did not deserve what happened.  The mayor and other officials are hoping the project can be completed within a year with a few dozen crews and under  optimal conditions,  per Weaver. Around 15,000 lines will be replaced, and  high-risk  households (those with children and pregnant women) will be first on the list. Funding for the project will come from the Michigan Legislature and the US Congress, Weaver said.

"(Aug 12, 2013  4:32 PM CDT) Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Motors and commercial space company SpaceX, has finally unveiled the  Hyperloop,  his much-hyped new transportation system idea. And it's pretty far out there. It's a bit like a human shotgun, explains Businessweek: people would sit inside aluminum pods, which would shoot through steel tubes at up to 800 miles per hour. It could also potentially hold cars. The pods would be mounted on skis above an air cushion, launched by an electromagnetic pulse and magnets, then propelled along the route by motors.  The pod can go just below the speed of sound relative to the air,  says Musk. Musk's vision is for a Hyperloop from LA to San Francisco, fueled by disappointment in the planned $70 billion California high-speed train, which he thinks will be too slow and expensive. Musk estimates a Hyperloop following the I-5 would cost $6 billion to build with pods just for people, or $10 billion for pods that could hold people and cars. Beyond that, he says, the system would work best for trips under 1,000 miles, like New York to DC or Boston. However, sci-fi fans and Californian commuters may be disappointed to learn that Musk has no plans to commercialize the Hyperloop yet.  I’m just putting this out there as an open source design,  he says.  I still have to run SpaceX and Tesla.  But if no one else takes his idea and runs with it, he may find time  down the road.

Then came the court case, where one of Sickles' seven lawyers claimed it was manslaughter, not murder, perpetrated in  a state of heat  that put Sickles above  the pale of accountability to the criminal law.  He added that it's  no matter how a man becomes insane; is he insane, this is the question?  The district attorney saw it differently, saying Sickles planned the attack and carried three pistols to the crime scene. But public opinion sided with Sickles, as did Harper's and the New York Times. And Sickles' theatricality won over jurors, moving some to tears when he cried during a friend's testimony and had to be escorted from the courtroom. The jury needed just 30 minutes to find him not guilty. In a twist, public opinion turned against Sickles when he made up with his wife, Teresa (who had only cheated on him over his  compulsive womanizing,  according to an old Times review of a Sickles biography). And when Sickles became ambassador to Spain, after Teresa's death by tuberculosis, he supposedly hooked up with Spain's deposed queen, Isabella II—who was married at the time.

"(Sep 28, 2016  12:31 PM CDT) When 14-year-old Elsie Frost was found dying of multiple stab wounds in a tunnel under a West Yorkshire train overpass in October of 1965, the news of her vicious murder  caused widespread shock and revulsion  across England, reports the Telegraph. But in spite of police questioning 12,000 men, only one suspect was ever arrested in the intervening five decades, and the case against him was ultimately thrown out for lack of evidence. Elsie's parents both died without learning who had killed their daughter, and her older sister and younger brother say that after all these years they want justice, and  didn’t want to die thinking we had not done anything.  Now, finally, police say there's been a break in the case. A year after Elsie's siblings asked police to reopen their investigation—which they did following a BBC Radio 4 series on the murder—authorities say they've arrested a 78-year-old man, reports the BBC. Peter Pickering, who was born in Manchester, apparently had links to Yorkshire, where Elsie was murdered, and would have been in his mid-20s in 1965. Though a murder weapon was never found, Elsie, who was said to have taken a different route home from school because she didn't want to get her new shoes muddy on her usual route, was found stabbed twice in the back (one pierced her heart), twice in the head, and once through the hand, reports the Guardian.

Per China Radio International, Zhang and his helpers—CRI says three men besides Zhang were involved, while Time speaks of  two accomplices —took in $600,000 a month exporting drugs manufactured in an industrial park in Wuhan, Hubei province. The BBC notes the drugs were sold in the UK, the US, Canada, and Australia. Zhang apparently hit upon the idea to create a Heisenberg-like drug factory in 2005 after visiting Australia and discovering certain psychoactive drugs were hard to come by there. He apparently wanted to please his customers, custom-creating drugs based on their needs by experimenting with various chemical techniques, per CRI. Workers were also trained to manufacture the drugs in bulk, and the drugs were said to be sent overseas via Western Union and via bitcoin transactions. The scheme fell apart in November 2015, when customs officers discovered parcels containing some of Zhang's product; his lab was raided in June.

"(Feb 9, 2018  10:35 AM) Most teenagers spend their free time playing video games or hanging out with friends. In Kansas, they run for governor. Last September there were two teens (Tyler Ruzich and Jack Bergeson) who'd announced they were vying for the state's top seat, and now four more—Aaron Coleman, Ethan Randleas, Dominic Scavuzzo, and Joseph Tutera Jr.—have joined their ranks. The New York Times reports on the six, ranging in age from 16 to 18, gunning for the $99,636-a-year post. The influx of minors into the race is a result of the state's rules not imposing any age restrictions, which has led local lawmakers to lobby for an age mandate to avoid in the future what the Times deems  a carnival-like note.  Specifically, a state House bill is in motion to require all candidates to have been residents in Kansas for at least four consecutive years, and to be of voting age in Kansas.  As soon as they turn 18, if they want to run for the legislature, knock yourself out,  bill sponsor Rep. Blake Carpenter says. The Kansas City Star notes all six of the teens were under 18 when they announced their candidacy, and they're expressing different reactions to Carpenter's bill.  I think it's trying to disenfranchise candidates,  says Bergeson, 17. Ruzich, who will turn 18 a month or so before 2018's Election Day, calls the bill a  common-sense proposal.  In the case of these teens, though, even if the bill goes through, it wouldn't become law until January—meaning if any of them win in November, they'd become the new governor. Not that hopes are especially high that will happen, at least for one candidate.  The day a 17-year-old wins governor of any state will be the day pigs fly,  the 16-year-old Tutera says.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday by New York artist Jason Koza, who claims his drawings of Wu-Tang members were used as album artwork for Once Upon a Time in Shaolin without his permission. According to NBC News, Koza blames Shkreli for  permitting at least three of the nine Wu-Tang Clan portraits to be displayed to the public in a news article,  referring to a story in Vice. Koza is also suing the Wu-Tang's RZA, an auction house, and a Wu-Tang producer. The Wu-Tang only made one copy of the Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, which Skhreli says he bought in order to  keep it from the people.  Meanwhile, Skhreli is also in the midst of an escalating battle with the Wu-Tang's Ghostface Killah, CNBC reports. The two have gone back and forth online ever since Ghostface expressed his unhappiness at the fact that Shkreli was Shaolin's buyer, and Skhreli recently threatened to erase Ghostface  from the record books of rap,  said he'd like to  smack him right in the face,  and demanded an apology for Ghostface's insults.

But Craig was determined to see his inspiration take root—and now, just a few months later, PotatoParcel is here, bringing in more than $10,000 in profit per month for the Texas entrepreneur. His brainchild: Charge customers between $8 and $10 for a potato, write a custom message on it with a Pilot G210 retractable rollerball pen, and mail it (anonymously) to the recipient of the customer's choice.  I would say the two things that hold everyone back in life is fear and doubt,  he says, explaining what drew him to this project.  The fear of failure and the fear of wasting your time, and the doubt that you can actually achieve something big on a huge scale.  Craig knew soon after promoting his service that  huge  was an apt way to describe public reaction. At the very least, he proved wrong his girlfriend, who had proclaimed,  You will not sell a single potato.

Per the Guardian, the space agency has released a decade's worth of  mesmerizing  footage of our resident star, taken from February 2010 all the way up to last month by a trio of instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Per NASA, the SDO stitched together 425 million high-res images into a 61-minute video, set to a soothing score by German musician Lars Leonhard, that depicts a full solar cycle—complete with developing sunspots, eruptions, and planets passing by. The SDO snapped a photo of the sun every 0.75 seconds, on average, with one of the instruments capturing a picture  every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light.  As for some parts of the video that seem amiss: NASA explains that at points when the sun seems off-center, the SDO instruments were recalibrating, while occasional dark frames (such as that seen at 53:29 in the video) were from the Earth or moon obscuring the light as they passed between the spacecraft and the sun. A slightly longer blackout in early August 2016 took place when there was a problem with one of the instruments, which was taken care of after about a week. Newsweek notes that the video comes out right before the European Space Agency releases the closest pictures of the sun ever taken, shot from the NASA-ESA Solar Orbiter, which got as close as 48 million miles away from the sun's surface.

"(Feb 16, 2011  8:37 AM) Chicago's population fell 6.9% during the decade that ended in 2010, leaving it with fewer people than lived there in 1920. The US Census Bureau reports a population of 2,695,598 people, just under the 2.7 million that were reported nearly a century ago, the Wall Street Journal reports. The recession is likely to blame for a significant migration to the suburbs and the South; even so, Chicago is expected to remain the third-largest city in the nation behind New York and Los Angeles. The Windy City's population peaked at 3.62 million in 1950, then declined for years until it experienced a boom in the 1990s. This most recent decline affected the city's black population more than most; it fell from more than 1 million to 887,608.  The black decline is really powering the city loss,  says a demographer, calling it  part of the great reverse migration to the South.  As Chicago's population fell, however, the population in neighboring counties surged—which could mean those traditionally conservative counties will become more politically diverse.",Chicago's Population Dips Below 1920 Level,Chicago's Population Dips Below ____ Level,1920,Copy( 1920 ),0

A dzud typically happens once every 12 years, but it has struck for the second consecutive year this winter, and it's putting the livelihoods of more than 150,000 nomadic herders and family members at risk. The dzud last year killed more than 1 million livestock, which are the only source of food, transport, and outside income for almost half of Mongolia's population of 3 million, the Red Cross said last week, as it launched an emergency appeal. More than 40,000 cows and other livestock have already died this time, a figure that's expected to jump in the freezing months ahead and into spring when animals are still weak. Many herder families will lose their livestock and livelihoods  and will have no choice but to migrate to the slum areas on the outskirts of [the capital, Ulaanbaatar] and other urban centers where they will face great social and economic hardship,  said the head of the Beijing office of the International Federation of Red Cross. The Red Cross said 70% of the country is covered by snow, and 157,000 people belonging to herder households in 17 of Mongolia's 21 provinces are at risk.

Coastal areas of Thailand, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other countries were deluged. One of the first areas hit was Indonesia's Aceh province, notes CBS News. In fact, most of those killed were in Indonesia alone, where 170,000 deaths were registered.

She said, 'It's OK, you can't think you are going to die,'  Griffin tells People. The thought helped calm her as she sat atop the branch for 12 hours in freezing weather following a car accident in California's Mendocino County last Wednesday. Griffin and her friend Jenna Santos, both 19, had been driving on Highway 101 during a rainstorm, with Santos at the wheel, when the car hydroplaned, flipped, and landed on its wheels in a swollen creek, reports the East Bay Times. As the car began filling with water, the women kicked out the cracked windshield, hoping to escape, but the water only flooded the vehicle faster. With water at the teens' necks, Griffin noticed the back window was also broken and told Santos to follow her out of it, reports the Press Democrat. Griffin made it out but was quickly carried downstream.  I remember reaching from the water and grabbing onto a branch and I pulled myself up,  she says. Santos never emerged from the car, and Griffin spent the next 12 hours on the branch in a light jacket as temperatures dropped to 28 degrees.

Genene Jones, 66, is serving concurrent 99-year and 60-year sentences for the 1982 killing of 15-month-old Chelsea McClelland and the sickening of a 4-week-old boy who survived, the AP reports. The girl was given a fatal injection of a muscle relaxant and the boy received a large injection of a blood thinner. Jones was due to be freed next March under a mandatory release law that was in place when she was convicted. But on Thursday, the district attorney's office announced that she has been charged in the 1981 death of 11-month-old Joshua Sawyer, who investigators say died of a fatal overdose of an anti-seizure drug, Dilantin. During Jones' time working in Texas hospitals and clinics, children died of unexplained seizures and other complications. At a news conference District Attorney Nico LaHood said Friday investigators believe Jones may have killed some or all of those children because they died under unusual circumstances during or shortly after her shifts. It's not clear why Jones' actions, involving so many suspected victims, were not detected earlier. Prosecutors at Jones' 1984 murder trial said the nurse lethally injected children there to demonstrate the need for a pediatric intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. Other prosecutors theorized that Jones' tactic was to take swift medical action and save some of her victims, making herself appear to be a sort of miracle worker.",Texas Nurse May Have Killed as Many as 60 Kids,Texas Nurse May Have Killed as Many as ____ Kids,60,Copy( 60 ),0

Shaw, the Hong Kong producer who is considered the father of the kung fu movie genre, died today at home in Hong Kong, aged 106. Shaw was born Shao Yifu;  Run Run  was a nickname. He and his older brother, the similarly-nicknamed Run Me, made their first film in 1924. By 1927, they had moved to Singapore and were producing movies as well as importing others to play in their theaters, the New York Times reports. After World War II, Run Run ended up in Hong Kong, where, by the late 1960s, he was enjoying great success making modern martial arts movies including Five Fingers of Death and Shaolin Avenger. The Shaw Bros. studio was the largest in Asia at that time, and produced the region's most popular films, the Los Angeles Times reports.  We were like the Hollywood of the 1930s,  Shaw once said; he had created Shaw Movietown, a huge complex where his employees both lived and worked.

"(Dec 8, 2011  2:54 AM) A court in Thailand sentenced a US citizen to two and a half years in prison today for defaming the country's royal family by translating excerpts of a locally banned biography of the king and posting them online. The 55-year-old Thai-born American, Joe Gordon, stood calmly with his ankles shackled in an orange prison uniform as the sentence was read out. The judge said the punishment, initially set at five years, was reduced because Gordon pleaded guilty in October. Gordon posted links to the banned biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej several years ago while living in Colorado, and his case has raised questions about the applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside Thailand. Speaking after the verdict, Gordon said,  I am an American citizen, and what happened was in America.  He was detained in late May during a visit to his native country to seek treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure.

With the Dodd-Frank Act empowering whistle-blowers, Obama's administration has paid them $1.6 billion so far, and lawyers have taken up to 40% of that.  Increasingly, this is not just about exposing wrongdoing,  says an analyst.  It is about trying to generate as much money and fees for the firms handling the cases.  In fact, top laws firms have helped SEC officials forge whistle-blower rules and later hired them on as lawyers. At the same time, the federal government has collected $13.2 billion from companies whose fraud was exposed by whistle-blowers—and the lawyers who have raised more than $3 million for Obama insist they're doing it out of admiration. But they don't deny the financial incentive:  The way you get more hunting dogs showing up is you feed them,  says the head of a legal industry group.

On Friday, police officials shared what the New York Times describes as  part letter, part journal, in 13 pages with many cross-outs and messy scrawl.  It's variously emotive and mundane, including things like directions and details of the exercises he did, and he reportedly told the fisherman who brought him near North Sentinel Island to pass it to a friend should something happen to him. The Times has excerpts, and the writings tell more of what he brought to the tribe—scissors, safety pins, and fishing line—and how he attempted to communicate with them. Chau wrote that he sang worship songs and responded to the yells of one man, who was bedecked with a white, flower-like crown, by saying some words in Xhosa that he had picked up while in South Africa.  They would often fall silent after this,  he wrote. On other occasions, they laughed. At one point he questioned whether the island was  Satan’s last stronghold.  When the fisherman again brought him near the island on Nov. 16, he told them he planned to stay overnight, so they left him for the first time. On their pass by the island the next morning, they saw his body being dragged by a rope. The letter's last lines:  Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed. I love you all.  The AP reports a second boat expedition involving police; forest department, tribal welfare department, and coast guard officials; and two of the people who helped Chau approach the island went near it on Friday in an attempt to locate where Chau died.",Man Killed by Remote Tribe Left 13-Page Letter Behind,Man Killed by Remote Tribe Left ____-Page Letter Behind,13,Copy( 13 ),0

"(Nov 21, 2012  6:11 PM) US abortions fell 5% during the recession and its aftermath in the biggest one-year decrease in at least a decade, perhaps because women are more careful to use birth control when times are tough, researchers say. The decline, detailed today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, came in 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Both the number of abortions and the abortion rate dropped by the same percentage. Mississippi had the lowest abortion rate, at 4 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. The state also had only a couple of abortion providers and has the nation's highest teen birth rate. New York, second to California in number of abortion providers, had the highest abortion rate, roughly eight times Mississippi's.

Instead of sharing what oxygen was left—what a member of the local underwater police tells the National Post would've been  suicide —Gracia, in his 50s, and Guillem Mascaro decided Mascaro would take what was left in Gracia's tank and venture for help. Gracia remained behind in a cave's air pocket they found (the Post describes it as a sizable one, measuring about 40,000 square feet) with only  brackish  water to drink. The air heavy with carbon dioxide, Gracia started imagining  lights or bubbles ; his oxygen-deprived brain made him think at one point five days had passed (it hadn't even been two) and Mascaro hadn't made it.

"(Jun 27, 2017  1:00 PM CDT) A Dutch art sleuth with an impressive track record says he's following two possible leads in the largest art heist in US history. Arthur Brand thinks a decision last month to double the reward to $10 million for information could prompt the return of 13 works stolen from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. At the end of the year, the reward will likely revert to $5 million, so  it's now or never,  Brand tells the AP. The stunning theft at the Gardner was remarkably simple. Two men masqueraded as Boston police and got into the museum by telling a security guard they were responding to a disturbance. Once inside, the thieves handcuffed two guards on duty and put them in the museum's basement before snatching masterpieces that included paintings by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Manet. The tenacious sleuth has a record of success—Brand helped German police seize a huge stash of art in 2015 that included two bronze horse sculptures crafted for Adolf Hitler, for instance. Neither of the leads Brand is following is new, with one focusing on a Dutch criminal who was reportedly in possession of photos of the stolen art and tried to sell the works in Europe in the early 1990s.  If he can tell us who gave ... him these pictures at the time, we could trace it back,  Brand says. But the museum's director of security says the FBI already has pursued Brand's leads,  and we're confident that we closed them without further need for investigation.  Asked to rank his chances of success on a scale of one to 10, Brand says,  In a logical world, I would say 10. But the art world is not logical.

"(Oct 7, 2019  4:03 PM CDT)  It’s hard to travel and not be aware that climate change is real,  Rick Steves says. He's also aware that his tour company contributes to that very issue by ferrying 30,000 tourists to Europe each year. So he's decided to assess his company a carbon tax of $1 million per year, Quartz reports. Steves arrived at that figure by multiplying the number of customers by $30, which is the recommended carbon offset credit, then rounding up. A US-Europe round-trip flight adds  roughly as much carbon into our atmosphere as driving a car for six months,  the TV host wrote on his site. The company won't raise prices to cover the amount, Steves said. Steves will donate the money to nonprofits working in developing countries that are the most affected, with an emphasis on agriculture. He this year contributed to sustainable farming, reforestation, and climate education efforts. This way, Steves said, he can help  farmers in the developing world have better lives while employing climate-smart agriculture and forestry techniques.  The list of organizations he funds will be revisited each year. It's a better solution, Steves figures, than reducing travel, which he said exposes tourists to other cultures and perspectives.

Those payments are on top of an additional $30,000 in government grant money for employee training at Marcus Bachmann's clinic. The clinic, which advertises  quality Christian counseling  for a range of mental health issues, also participates in a state subsidized health insurance program, notes MSNBC. Revelation of the health care payments—in addition to some $260,000 in subsidies for a Wisconsin farm owned in part by the Bachmanns—is proving an embarrassment to the Tea Party candidate who rips such  big government  aid on the campaign stump.

Census figures for 2009, the recession-ravaged first year of the Democrat's presidency, are to be released in the coming week, and demographers expect grim findings.

Something had been smoked in the pipe bowls and stems unearthed from William Shakespeare' garden in Stratford-upon-Avon; the question was what. Researchers in South Africa now have gas chromatography mass spectrometry to thank for their answer. A piece in the Conversation based on the report published in the South African Journal of Science explains the  technique is very sensitive to residues that can be preserved in pipes even if they had been smoked 400 years ago.  Eight of the 24 pipe-fragment samples tested were shown to contain cannabis; another had evidence of nicotine, and two more  evidence for Peruvian cocaine from coca leaves.  Of those, only four of the cannabis samples were from Shakespeare's garden; the others were from the Stratford-upon-Avon area. Study author Francis Thackeray writes that the research establishes that a wide range of plants were smoked in the area during the early 17th century, and he leans on Shakespeare's own words to try to draw connections. Thackeray references Sonnet 76, which refers to  invention in a noted weed ; he interprets weed as cannabis and invention as writing.

Another inmate called his mother, telling her,  The inmates have taken over the prison,  per the Omaha World Herald. Prisoner Daryl Eskridge said the riot was because inmates' pleas (and petition) for better conditions appeared to fall on deaf ears, per the Journal-Star.  We understand this is a prison, but we have been subjected to a lot of things the department doesn't want people to see,  Eskridge says, citing inadequate access to the prison and yards, inmates' inability to get jobs, awful living conditions, and harassment.

Apple's compensation committee recently decided that this summer's cash dividend should apply to the restricted stock units awarded to some Apple employees, a group that includes Cook. But Cook requested his shares not be included—and the SEC filing explains that  assuming a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share over the vesting periods of his 1.125 million outstanding restricted stock units, Mr. Cook will forgo approximately $75 million in dividend equivalent value.

Authorities in the northern state of Para say Adam and Emily Harteau and daughters Colette, 6, and Sierra, 3, are being treated in the city of Breves for insect bites and dehydration after spending three days hiding in the jungle after leaving the boat, the Wall Street Journal reports. They say the family and their Volkswagen van were on a barge that was hijacked in a dangerous Amazon delta area by pirates who abandoned the vessel after seizing goods including the family's cell phones. Crew members were eventually able to call police, but the Harteaus had vanished by the time they turned up. Police say the Harteaus have told them they were worried about their safety so they hid in the jungle with some food and water—and the surfboard they had left the barge on. Villagers reportedly found them on the surfboard, initially thought to have been driftwood, and contacted a passenger boat that picked them up. Para Deputy Secretary of Public Safety Andre Cunha has told local media that he's not entirely sure why they left the boat, but they may have been worried about police because of the small amount of marijuana that was found in their van, the Los Angeles Times reports. Officials say the amount was too small for charges to be considered.

USA Today recounts the incredible story of how one teen's cry for help in a May 6 Tumblr post set off a nationwide search to find the girl before she committed suicide. It started when 18-year-old Jackie Rosas from Cathedral City, California, saw the troubling post by the 16-year-old, whose blog she had read for a year. Armed with only the blog URL, the girl's first name, and the fact that she was in her school's color guard, Rosas called a suicide hotline and then local police. An officer took over the case around 5pm and set about tracking her down. The officer sought help from a local high school; administrators didn't recognize the girl from her blog photo, but they joined the hunt, locating her Twitter feed. In it, they spotted a November tweet referencing the  UHS marching band.  Their web sleuthing finally surfaced a newspaper article on a marching band that provided the key piece of evidence: Union Township, New Jersey. They contacted police in the area around 1:30am; they were dispatched to a local address where they found the girl, who had taken some pills, and got her medical attention.

That's because McDonald's has negotiated an early end to its corporate sponsorship agreement with the International Olympic Committee, which was scheduled to run through the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Effective immediately, McDonald's is no longer one of the IOC's top sponsors, though it signed an eight-year sponsorship extension in 2012, per the AP. The company is believed to have paid about $25 million per year to call itself the Olympics food retail sponsor, reports Reuters. It's not cutting ties completely, however. Under the change announced Friday, McDonald's will keep domestic marketing rights in South Korea for the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, per a release. It will also keep restaurants in the Olympic Park and Olympic Village in 2018. Last year, McDonald's announced it would review its Olympic sponsorship deal, citing a new advertising rule that allowed non-official sponsors to benefit. In a statement, the company says it will  focus on different priorities … as part of our global growth plan.

"(Aug 17, 2008  3:46 PM CDT) Two decades after its founding, al-Qaeda's golden years are over, argues Peter Bergen in the Washington Post. Osama bin Laden's plan has largely backfired: 9/11 neither resulted in US withdrawal from the Middle East, or in the defeat of  impious  Middle Eastern regimes. But while al-Qaeda discredited itself in Iraq and jihadists are less centralized than in 2001, the organization still poses a threat to the West. Most alarming is al-Qaeda Central's hold on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the number of Muslim foreigners who have been traveling there. And while European Islamists are seldom linked to al-Qaeda, disenfranchised immigrants remain fertile ground for new recruits. Plus, bin Laden is still on the loose, effectively raising calls to arms in the media. The  legacy will endure, even after al-Qaeda is defeated,  writes Bergen.","At 20, al-Qaeda Is in Decline","At ____, al-Qaeda Is in Decline",20,Trans( Two decades ),1

He cited fears of an increased threat from Iran following the latest attacks on shipping in the region, the Guardian reports.  The recent Iranian attacks validate the reliable, credible intelligence we have received on hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region,  Shanahan said in a statement Monday.

Turns out, the sketch (see it here) is by a renowned Austrian expressionist named Egon Schiele, and it could fetch up to $200,000 when it's eventually sold, reports the Art Newspaper.

On Friday, two more exposés on Kelly were published: lengthy pieces in BuzzFeed and the Washington Post. The Post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against Kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him (two of whom have never spoken out publicly before); BuzzFeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with Kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly  brainwashed  by Kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call  Daddy.  They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups.

We believe they were at the swap meet as a diversion and [Francillon Pierre] was already deceased,  an investigator said at a Monday news conference, noting neighbors hadn't seen the boy for weeks prior to that event, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Eight months earlier, a babysitter had found 30 to 40 welts on Francillon's neck and back, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Fleming and Luster, who moved to Florida in 1987, were found guilty of felony child abuse and sentenced to probation.  We definitely believe that child abuse could have played a factor in this homicide,  the investigator said.  At this point, evidence points to [Fleming], but the investigation is ongoing,  an officer added, per the Sun Sentinel. Fleming initially claimed Francillon vanished while the family was shopping for a bicycle. She later implicated his father, who was cleared as a suspect; he then lived in Haiti. Police say new witnesses and evidence have emerged since 2017, when officers learned someone tried to apply for a fraudulent birth certificate in Francillon's name.

"(Jan 2, 2011  6:15 PM) It may seem unbelievable, but 20,000 Chinese citizens live in isolated colonies for people who suffer an ancient, debilitating disease: leprosy. More than 600 state-run colonies exist throughout China, usually separated from society by nature—the government took care to build them on islands, mountaintops, or generally inaccessible locations. Though the government stopped forcibly detaining people affected with leprosy in 1980—the US only stopped doing so in 1960—the colonies retain many of their inhabitants who, after years, have lost their connections to the outside world. Slate describes life in one of the colonies, which house between 25 and 100 people in a small village of straw or mud-brick houses. Many inhabitants have lost mobility or dexterity to their leprosy, though some, who received treatment early, farm small plots or raise fish. Only 3% of residents are infectious, and the healthy but affected are joined by at least 5,000 healthy spouses and children.",What Life Is Like for China's 20K Lepers,What Life Is Like for China's ____K Lepers,20,"Paraphrase( 20,000 , K )",1

Richard Taverna was waiting for the subway Thursday at the Lincoln Center-66th Street 1 train stop when he spotted a blue Chanel bag on the platform:  I picked it up to see if there was an identification so I could get it to the right person,  he tells WABC. Finding a note inside in Russian, and seeing no MTA agent nearby, Taverna took the bag home—where he found a hundred $100 bills (an even ten grand) that, all things considered, might never be linked to him if he took it.

According to the UN's Zainab Bangura, the terrorist group is circulating a pamphlet that lists specific prices for its captives, including sex slaves and infants. Bangura says she's verified the pamphlet, which first surfaced online in November, since getting hold of a copy in Iraq in April, noting it reflects actual transactions.  The girls get peddled like barrels of petrol,  she tells Bloomberg.  One girl can be sold and bought by five or six different men. Sometimes these fighters sell the girls back to their families for thousands of dollars of ransom.  Bangura says the group's leaders get the first pick of captives before outsiders bid into the thousands on those that remain. Afterward, children aged 1 to 9 are typically sold to Islamic State fighters for about $165, according to the pamphlet. The prices then fall as the captives' ages rise. Adolescent girls fetch $124, while women over 20 are sold for less. The organized price list is just another way ISIS differs from other militant groups, Bangura says.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest numbers Monday, and those numbers reveal that so far this year at least 704 people have come down with the viral infection, the Washington Post reports. That's the highest single-year tally since 1994, which saw 963 cases, per the AP. Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. More than 500 of the people infected this year were not vaccinated, and about 75% of the cases are in children or teenagers. No deaths have been reported, but 66 people have been hospitalized.  Vaccine-preventable diseases belong in the history books, not in our emergency rooms,  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  The suffering we are seeing today is completely avoidable.

In that state, a child under the age of 15 can't consent to sex, making Olivas, now 24, a statutory rape victim of the woman who gave birth to his daughter. Olivas believes that the woman—who was 20 at the time of their sexual encounter—took advantage of him and that he shouldn't be held responsible for his actions because he was a child, reports the Arizona Republic. He didn't press charges, because he says he didn't know that was an option at the time. (Nor did he know about the baby.

Gawker's attorney had asked the judge to reduce the jury's verdict or toss it completely.

Authorities say  security prisoners  serving more than five years will not be released. Iran says 2,336 people have tested positive for the coronavirus and 77 have died, but the true number of people infected is believed to be much higher.

The Dutch royal family will visit for the anniversary, and two historical exhibitions include major loans from the Netherlands. One includes the 1626 letter attesting that Dutch settlers had bought Manhattan from the natives for  the value of 60 guilders,  famously converted to $24. New Amsterdam: The Island at the Center of the World, on view at the South Street Seaport Museum, doesn't provide as much context as you might like, says New York Times critic Edward Rothstein. But it shows how New Amsterdam, unlike English colonies such as Jamestown, boasted diversity and a rollicking free market. That's not unlike the present day.

"(Jul 2, 2017  6:56 PM CDT) An Alaskan boy earned eternal playground bragging rights in June when he saved himself and three others from a charging brown bear. Juneau Empire reports that 11-year-old Elliot Clark, who has since turned 12, was walking single-file through the woods to a fishing hole with two adult relatives and his cousin when a brown bear charged the group. The two adults, including an uncle who was armed, were pushed to the side of the trail.  The bear was on him so quickly that he didn’t have time to take his rifle off his shoulder,  Elliot’s father, Lucas, told the Empire. Elliot, who was next in line and in front of his unarmed cousin, fired multiple shots that brought the bear down at the boy’s feet. Elliot’s pump-action shotgun was filled with birdshot, which is typically used to scare, not kill, large animals like bears. Lucas, who was not present during the bear attack, says that two lucky conditions contributed to his son’s deadeye reaction. Elliot didn’t have a sling on his gun, so he was carrying it in a manner that allowed him to shoot quickly. And just one day before the incident, Elliot asked his father for permission to remove a plug from his gun that only allowed it three shots.  It’s not just a matter of skill or preparedness. It can happen to anybody and it can go wrongly,  Lucas Clark said. State Sen. Shelley Hughes praised Elliot's  bravery  on her Facebook page, where she also posted bear safety links.

But alternatives, including wet wipes and partial paper towels, aren't flushable. That mistake can cause problems in a home's plumbing as well as city sewer systems, per CBS.

The girls—11-year-old twins Dara and Jana and 13-year-old Catie—were smothered by canola seed in the back of a truck, though the details of their deaths remain hazy. A deputy fire chief tells CBC News the girls somehow fell into the canola seed while the truck was being unloaded. But the Journal reports the girls were playing on the truck while it was being filled with seed and were buried. Regardless, family members and neighbors pulled the girls out and attempted CPR without success, according to the Calgary Sun.  Our kids died living life on the farm,  the Alberta family says in a statement.  We do not regret raising and involving our kids … on our farm. It was our life.  The family's pastor spoke on behalf of the family, telling the Journal:  They are obviously devastated. There is just a deep sense of loss and sadness.  Neighbors were planning to finish the grieving family's autumn harvest for them, and nine combines and several trucks were already on the job Wednesday. One man sent up a drone to take a photo of the group effort.  I want Roger to see this,  he said, referring to the girls' father.  I want him to know how everyone is here to help him.

The suit filed in federal court in Kentucky on behalf of 16-year-old Nicholas Sandmann claims the Post  wrongfully targeted and bullied Nicholas because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red 'Make America Great Again' souvenir cap,  reports Reuters. Nicholas, a student at Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, was accused of bigotry after he was filmed standing inches in front of a Native American protester and smiling, though he later said he was trying to defuse the situation and videos emerged that showed Nicholas and fellow students did not initiate the encounter. The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, accuses the newspaper of  smearing a young boy  by  publishing a series of false and defamatory print and online articles.  The Post—which is being sued for the same amount Jeff Bezos bought it for in 2013—says it is reviewing the lawsuit and it plans to mount a  vigorous defense,  CNN reports. Nicholas' lawyers have been busy: Fox reports that more than 50 letters ahead of possible libel and defamation lawsuits were sent out earlier this month to the New York Times, CNN, Sen.

The Texas state senator raked in $1.2 million in the six weeks following her marathon filibuster, reports Politico. Most of it came from small donors—the average donation was $52—and some $470,000 arrived from outside Texas, with California and New York topping the list. (Among the notable donors: Anita Hill and Eugene Zagat.) It's a hefty sum, but still a long way from the more than $20 million drummed up by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the most likely Republican nominee. A Democratic win in a state that's handed all of its statewide offices to Republicans for nearly two decades would be no easy task, the New York Times reports, but it sees other benefits to a Davis run: her rising star could be used to energize the party, and a bid for governor would force the Republican Governors Association to divert millions from more competitive races in other states.

The New York Daily News reports that the elder Stevenson, who came up with the  Sourtoe Cocktail  that has  delighted and disgusted  customers at the Downtown Hotel in Yukon, Canada, for nearly five decades, has died at the age of 89. The former riverboat captain came up with the idea for his signature libation—an alcohol-based drink that has a mummified human toe floating in it—in 1973, when he and some friends found a preserved toe in an abandoned cabin and inexplicably decided to add it to a boozy beverage. Stevenson and his crew also came up with the Sourtoe drinking ritual that made its way to the Downtown and has attracted brave imbibers ever since. To join the  club,  the person downing the cocktail has to make sure their lips actually touch the floating toe.

Great-great-grandmother Mary Hardison has been officially recognized as the  Oldest Female to Paraglide Tandem  by Guinness World Records. She has supplanted a 100-year-old woman from Cyprus who took her flight in 2007. Hardison flew with an instructor on Sept. 1, 2011, while four generations of her family watched and cheered. The flight went smoothly and even included a few tricks that Hardison encouraged. In a questionnaire submitted to Guinness, Hardison said she wanted to paraglide because her 75-year-old son began doing it as a hobby.

The 22-year-old former actor has been found guilty of violent disorder, and sentenced to two years in prison, reports the BBC. Waylett played Slytherin minion Vincent Crabbe in the first six Potter movies, but his character was written out of the last two films in the series after his arrest for growing marijuana in 2009. In mitigation, his lawyer told the court that he had become a  withered actor by the age of 22,  and had struggled with early fame.

The address pulled in just 33.3 million viewers, the lowest since Bill Clinton's final SOTU address in 2000, when there were 35 million fewer Americans, the Hollywood Reporter finds. The ratings were just a little down from the 33.5 million who watched Obama's SOTU address last year, but still well above the 31.5 million who watched Clinton in 2000. MSNBC and CNN saw big drops in viewer numbers year-on-year, but Fox—by far the most-watched network for the address—managed to gain a big rise in viewer numbers to 4.7 million, up 25% from last year, Mediaite reports. But there's one still one loser at Fox: Bill O'Reilly, who confidently predicted that his pre-address show would be watched by more Fox viewers than Obama's speech.

NCAA President Mark Emmert said that though there was no action it could take to remove the victims' pain and suffering,  what we can do is impose sanctions that reflect the magnitude of these terrible acts.  Penn State will also have all its wins from 1998 to 2011 voided, and have its football scholarships slashed from 25 to 15 for four years, reports the Patriot-News. Current players will be able to transfer out and play immediately wherever they go, or keep their scholarships even if they leave the team.

"(May 30, 2019  2:52 AM CDT) The family of an inmate who died a slow death from dehydration after water to his cell was cut off has received one of the largest settlements for a jail death in American history. Terrill Thomas, 38, died in solitary confinement in April 2016, seven days after water was cut off as punishment for flooding a previous cell at the Milwaukee County Jail, the BBC reports. The $6.75 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by his family includes $5 million from the county and $1.75 million from Armor Correctional Health Services, which provided health care at the jail.  This settlement reflects not only the profound harm suffered by Mr. Thomas and his family, but also the shocking nature of the defendants’ misconduct in shutting off this man’s water and ignoring his obvious signs of distress as he literally died of thirst,  the family's lawyers said in a statement. Court documents state that on his last day alive, Thomas  was simply lying naked on his cell floor, barely able to move, severely dehydrated, literally dying of thirst.  Thomas was arrested in April 2016 after firing two shots inside a casino and stuffing poker chips into his pockets. Relatives say he was having a mental breakdown after failing to take medication for bipolar disorder, and his condition prevented him from communicating with jail staff. Three jail employees were convicted for their roles in the death and criminal charges are pending against Armor, USA Today reports.  What happened to him was a form of torture,  says attorney Erik Heipt, per the AP.  This sort of atrocity should never happen at an American jail. There's no excuse for it.  He says the settlement will be split among Thomas' six children, including four minors.

They couldn't dig it out after trying for seven hours Thursday, and there was no cellphone service, so Maia Herman-Kitami, 18—who is an experienced camper but had never been in the snow before—posted a sign at the trailhead asking for help and directing would-be rescuers to their Jeep, ABC 7 reports. She and Carlos Hernandez Jr., 21, started rationing their food and drinking melted snow. Fortunately, they had enough gas in the car to keep the engine and heat running.

It sounds like the ramblings of a very high man,  Kelsey McKinney writes at the Fader, in a piece exploring how the former Blink-182 guitarist and singer has somehow become  one of the world's leading UFO experts.  DeLonge has amassed a respectable team of experts, including scientists and former military and intelligence officials, to investigate his claims through his To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences. And just two months after the academy's launch last October, one of its employees, former Pentagon official Luis Elizondo, helped reveal what DeLonge said was true: that a decade-long Pentagon program focused on much of the same work of DeLonge's team. DeLonge's credibility also has been bolstered by emails showing he was discussing UFOs with Hillary Clinton campaign manager and former White House official John Podesta in 2015. DeLonge claims he's also chatted with Pentagon officials and other government sources, including one who told him an alien life form has been found. At the same time, the story includes a quote from a former bandmate who once said DeLonge would unquestioningly believe pretty much anything he reads, no matter how crazy. So why this mission?

The poll, which was conducted Friday and released Sunday, found that the former New York City mayor has the highest unfavorable rating among likely primary voters of any Democratic hopeful, Politico reports. Some 25% view Bloomberg unfavorably, according to the poll, and he is the first choice of just 4% of likely voters, which puts him in sixth place, behind Kamala Harris but ahead of Andrew Yang. The poll found that Joe Biden is the current frontrunner, with 31% support, followed by Bernie Sanders at 20%, Elizabeth Warren at 18%, Pete Buttigieg at 8%, and Harris at 6%. But the poll also found that Bloomberg is 6 points ahead of President Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup, with 43% choosing Bloomberg, 37% choosing Trump, and the rest undecided, CNBC reports. Biden, Sanders, and Warren were 4, 5, and 6 points ahead of Trump, respectively. Analysts say a Bloomberg run might hurt Biden and help Sanders and Warren by drawing centrist voters away from the frontrunner. If Bloomberg does enter the race, he is expected to concentrate on Super Tuesday states instead of the handful that vote earlier, although that isn't a strategy that paid off for fellow former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2008.

Nixon rose to prominence during the '60s and '70s, and NPR describes her as one of the only powerful women in the entertainment industry during that era. Just like Nixon herself, two of her more famous creations were well-loved and and long-lived: All My Children ran for over four decades, while One Life To Live aired for 44 seasons. Both ended in 2011. Nixon was well-known for using her shows to draw attention to controversial social issues. Her plots addressed everything from cancer to abortion to homosexuality, issues often elided by many TV shows of the era. As the New York Times notes, Susan Lucci's character on All My Children was the first on TV to have a legal abortion—in 1973, just after Roe v. Wade.  I wasn't trying to change the genre, I was just trying to write what I thought, what was interesting to me,  Nixon told NPR in 2010.

"(Oct 1, 2012  10:16 AM CDT) Hospitalizations from child-abuse injuries climbed 4.9% between 1997 and 2009, a national study finds, with deaths before discharge also increasing. The data runs  in sharp contrast to data from child protective services,  say the study's authors. Those groups found that substantiated child abuse dropped 55% between 1992 and 2009, ABC News reports, while another report, required by Congress, found a 23% decline. The discrepancy may partially be the result of differences in the specifics of what's being studied: The child protective services study didn't take age or severity of abuse into account. Some 54% of hospitalizations in the new study were of kids less than a year old.

"(Oct 15, 2018  2:06 PM CDT) The first person to be convicted in connection with the 9/11 terror attacks was released from prison in Germany Monday. Mounir el-Motassadeq, convicted of being an accomplice in the US attacks, is being deported to his native Morocco, the BBC reports. He had served almost 15 years in prison, nearly his entire sentence. He was being transported under heavy security, and was accompanied by several police officers on his commercial flight to Morocco, but once he gets there it's not clear what will happen to him. Motassadeq was friends with Mohammed Atta, who allegedly flew one of the hijacked planes on 9/11, and other members of the Hamburg cell of al-Qaeda that orchestrated the attacks, but he has long denied involvement. Deutsche Welle has an extensive look at the cell and how Motassadeq got involved. Motassadeq, who arrived in Germany to study engineering at age 19, admitted to the aforementioned friendships as well as to having spent time at an Afghanistan al-Qaeda camp in 2000; he also signed Atta's will. After investigators found that he had power of attorney over a bank account owned by one of the other alleged 9/11 pilots and that he had arranged a bank transfer for some of the cell members who underwent flight training in the US, prosecutors labeled him as the cell's treasurer. He maintained, over five years of trials involving convictions, appeals, and overturned verdicts, that he was simply doing favors for his friends and had no knowledge of the impending attacks. He was ultimately found guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and being an accessory to murder, and received the maximum sentence. He was released early in exchange for agreeing to be deported, the AP reports. He can be arrested if he ever returns to Germany.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on the increase for the fourth straight day, the Hill reports. Congress adjourns on Saturday. Saying it was the last chance to approve the House bill that calls for sending bigger payments to Americans, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor that  if the Senate does not take action today, $2,000 checks will not become law before the end of Congress and they will know that Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have prevented them from getting the checks.

The filing notes that Vincent died of cardiac arrest and bradycardia in a North Carolina hospital. Sources tell TMZ he was cremated and that there was no autopsy. Us Weekly details how Vincent got into acting in the late '60s, shortly after getting out of the National Guard in California. He appeared in a long string of TV shows and movies, including Lassie and Bonanza, though his performance as Stringfellow  String  Hawke on Airwolf was his most famous role. Vincent struggled with alcohol and drug addiction for many years, which TMZ notes was partly responsible for cutting short Airwolf's run after just a few seasons. His last listed role was in the 2002 movie White Boy.

Perry took 48 trips across state lines, mostly to primary battlegrounds Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.

And no one initially disputed the Sudanese immigrant's age of 17—until apparently this week, when the basketball star was found to probably be a 30-year-old man and arrested for allegedly violating the country's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nicola, who had his first detention review Tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in Canada from Sudan in November, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life.  I don't know how many of [my friends] have a clue of how it is in Africa,  he had told the Star back in January.

Basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone.

Prosecutors say Hawthorne resident Ali Elmezayen deliberately drove his car off a Los Angeles wharf in 2015, Fox reports. He emerged through an open window and swam to safety. His domestic partner, Rabab Diab, was rescued by a fisherman who threw her a flotation device, but their two sons, 8-year-old Abdelkrim and 13-year-old Elhassan, drowned inside the vehicle. The severely autistic boys couldn't swim and were strapped in car seats. Prosecutors say the deaths were a double murder that Elmezayen plotted for more than two years.

Prosecutors say the 44-year-old—who initially denied taking out accidental death policies on his two sons—collected more than $260,000 in insurance payouts, which he wired back to his native Egypt.

"(Jun 17, 2016  7:49 AM CDT) A group of nearly three dozen migrants, most of them kids, paid smugglers to whisk them out of Niger and Nigeria and to a new life to the north—but instead paid the ultimate price. The five men, nine women, and 20 minors were found dead Sunday in the Sahara, per Niger's Ministry of Interior, apparently ditched by those they'd hoped would save them and likely victims of extreme thirst, ABC News reports. The interior minister said the migrants had perished between June 6 and June 12 near Assamaka, per the BBC, with the Guardian noting that temps in the desert can soar upward of 105 degrees Fahrenheit. What transpired isn't an uncommon consequence:  Thousands of people have lost their lives as a result of the indifferent or even deliberate actions of migrant smugglers,  the UN Office on Drugs and Crime says on its website, noting that as borders have become more tightly policed, migrants have become more wary of trying to cross over on their own. Which often leads to a  highly profitable  endeavor for the smugglers, who  enjoy low risk of detection and punishment,  and tragedy for the smuggled, who may pay upward of $345 each for the chance to escape, per an International Organization for Migration report. The IOM notes that Niger is a waypoint for escapees on their way to Algeria and Libya (and Europe after that), with migrants usually hailing from Nigeria, Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea-Bissau. What made this group of doomed deserters unusual: the number of children. Per the IOM report, a tracking tool showed that between February and April, the 60,000-plus migrants who passed through Niger were overwhelmingly male and between the ages of 18 and 59.

Most bristle worm jaws are a scant few millimeters long and require a microscope to see; this worm's jaws were longer than a centimeter and could be seen with the naked eye. Scientists published their findings Tuesday in Scientific Reports. While the fossils of ancient worms typically contain only their jaws, as their bodies are too soft to be preserved well, scientists can extrapolate that this new species of aquatic worm grew to more than 3 feet long. The giant, large-jawed worm has been named Websteroprion armstrongi after Derek Armstrong, who originally found the fossil, and Alex Webster, bass player for death metal band Cannibal Corpse. It seems the three scientists who discovered the worm are big music fans and amateur musicians.

"(Aug 10, 2009  12:27 PM CDT) The incidence of multiple myeloma in 9/11 responders appears to be higher than in the general population, according to what one researcher calls  very preliminary  stats. Eight cases of the blood cancer were diagnosed in 28,000 emergency personnel followed between 2001 and 2007; statistically, that number should be closer to six. And four of the eight men diagnosed, all law enforcement officers, were under 45, very young to have developed the disease, HealthDay News reports.  A person is 10 times more likely to get myeloma when they're 70 than when they're 45,  the lead author of the study says.

"(Jul 22, 2015  10:00 AM CDT) A leading Nazi hunter has asked Denmark to investigate a 90-year-old Dane suspected of being involved in the mass murder of Jews in Belarus during World War II. Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center filed the request yesterday with the Copenhagen police after the Justice Ministry last year turned down a similar request saying it was not their matter. Zuroff says they have a strong case against Helmuth Leif Rasmussen because of documents found by Danish historians published in a book last year, and that they were looking at other cases. The book, En skole i vold (A Book of Violence), claims that 1,400 Jews died in Belarus when Rasmussen, now known by the name Rasboel, was in the  inner circle  of the Bobruisk camp run by the SS.  Some of these people were involved in terrible crimes,  Zuroff says.  Now we're looking for additional Danish Waffen SS who served in this camp. This might only be the tip of the iceberg.  Some 6,000 Danish volunteers joined the SS during World War II after the German army invaded the country in 1940. Prosecutors say they will review the material before deciding if they need further information. Rasboel, who lives in Copenhagen, has acknowledged in interviews that he had been a guard and a member of the SS, but has denied involvement in killings. One of the authors of the book, Dennis Larsen, who has interviewed Rasboel twice, says he admitted seeing Jews  being killed and thrown into mass graves.   But he always said he was a bystander,  Larsen says.  He said he was just a guard, nothing else.","Famed Nazi Hunter Goes After SS Guard, 90","Famed Nazi Hunter Goes After SS Guard, ____",90,Copy( 90 ),0

Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and the Huffington Post's Ryan Reilly say they were reporting on the protests when a SWAT team entered the restaurant and hauled them away, reports the AP. Both men say they were  handled roughly  after being accused of trespassing but were later released without being charged—and without any good explanation, reports the New York Times, which also notes that police arrested more than 10 others last night, including a St. Louis alderman who was vocal on social media about the protests. Police  crowd control  tactics since Brown's death have come under heavy criticism, especially the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, and guns trained on the crowds, reports Vox.com.  They essentially acted as a military force,  Reilly said on MSNBC via the Huffington Post, revealing that he thinks he was detained because he wouldn't give his ID.  The worst part was [the officer] slammed my head against the glass purposefully on the way out of McDonald's and then sarcastically apologized for it.  Lowery gives his own account in the Washington Post, saying that he was  slammed … into a soda machine  and that no one would tell him the arresting officer's name or ID number (read his entire first-person account). The St. Louis American also tweeted a similar claim last night, saying that  Two of our unarmed, female reporters had assault weapons pointed at them by officers.

The protesters today demanded information on the fate of mostly Sunni detainees held on security and terrorism-related charges, and their immediate release. The protesters asked to meet with the interior minister, Prince Nayef, but their request was turned down and they were not allowed to go inside the building.

Many watching the festive arrival praised a Cuban government decision to drop a longstanding ban on Cuban-born people returning to their homeland by sea, a step that allowed 16 Cuban-Americans to make the journey from Miami.  This is history,  says Mercedes Lopez, a 54-year-old nurse who waited for hours to see Carnival Cruise Line's 704-passenger Adonia pull up to Havana's two-berth cruise terminal.  We Cubans must unite, all of us. This is a step forward, a little step toward normalization, peace, family unification.  The passengers of the Adonia were welcomed by live music and dancing inside Havana's single state-run cruise terminal. Outside, police carved a single lane into the crowd of hundreds of Cubans waiting in Old Havana's Plaza San Francisco for passengers taking walking tours of the restored colonial center.

To show their loyalty, workers are putting in extra hours to boost production in everything from coal mining to work in fisheries. Bright red flags and propaganda posters have gone up around the country to emphasize the importance of meeting or exceeding production targets, the AP reports.

Kim is expected to use the congress to showcase his achievements and power—and potentially announce a road map for the country's future political and economic strategies. The campaign comes as North Korea is under heavy pressure from the outside world over its recent nuclear test and rocket launches.

Now, what's believed to be the first sentencing of its kind: that of Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer who found out Monday she'll be spending four years behind bars for documenting how the coronavirus was ravaging Wuhan earlier this year, the New York Times reports. Zhang heard her fate in the Pudong New District People's Court in Shanghai after a trial that lasted less than three hours, in which she was convicted for the charge of  picking quarrels and provoking trouble.  The South China Morning Post notes the offense, which is often used by police to target dissenters, carries a maximum sentence of five years. According to her indictment, Zhang had been detained twice before in 2019 on that charge, per CNN. The 37-year-old headed from Shanghai to Wuhan in early February and spent three-plus months there showing crowded hospitals and deserted storefronts via her social media accounts, including Twitter and YouTube, which are banned in China. She abruptly vanished in May, and it was discovered she'd been arrested and brought back to Shanghai. Zhang's lawyers say she went on a hunger strike to protest her detention; they add that she was force-fed by authorities using a feeding tube and that her hands were restrained so she couldn't remove it. One of her attorneys, who notes she's lost a lot of weight and  may not survive,  per CBS News, says she showed up in a wheelchair to her trial. Supporters, meanwhile, say they were denied access to the proceedings.

"(Oct 10, 2011  7:13 PM CDT) America's obsession with terrorism after 9/11 has left our borders prone to the tiniest of invaders, an AP study finds. Focused on guns and bombs, inspectors have overlooked foreign insects and plant diseases that menace the country's food supply, send prices soaring, and leave pesticide residue on food. Among our worst attacks: 19 fruit fly infestations that prompted spraying and quarantines in California, and a New Zealand moth that survived 1,600 pounds of pesticides.  Whether they know it or not, every person in the country is affected by this,  says one entomologist; one study puts the total annual cost at $120 billion. The security shift from agriculture to terror also prompted a culture war at border posts, where gun-toting Homeland Security agents took precedence over scientists—triggering hundreds of resignations.

In 1983, Jimmy  Superfly  Snuka, one of the World Wrestling Federation's biggest stars, returned to his hotel room after an event to find 23-year-old Nancy Argentino  gasping for air and oozing yellow fluid from her mouth and nose,  according to the Allentown Morning Call. Argentino died the next day, and an autopsy report, which classified the death as a homicide, stated she had brain injuries and scores of cuts and bruises all over her body. Despite Snuka being the only person of interest in the case, he was never charged. That autopsy report was never seen until it was dug up by the Morning Call as part of a 2013 story on the cold case, a story the AP reports prompted the district attorney to send the case to a grand jury last year. Between the autopsy, Snuka's multiple accounts of how Argentino was injured—including allegedly telling multiple people he pushed her—and previous allegations of abuse on his part against both Argentino and his wife, the grand jury found enough to charge the 72-year-old former wrestler with murder and involuntary manslaughter.  It's been a long road,  Argentino's sister tells the Morning Call.  They did the right thing in the face of all the evidence.

More than 1 million checks for a combined $1.4 billion were distributed to dead people, according to a government watchdog report covering coronavirus relief spending approved by Congress as of April 30. In the rush to disburse $269 billion to 160.4 million people  as rapidly as possible,  as mandated by the Cares Act, Treasury officials followed procedures put in place for 2008 stimulus payments and  did not include using death records as a filter,  per NBC News. The Treasury doesn't have access to the Social Security Administration's full set of death records, as the IRS does, though it gained temporary access upon discovering that some payments were being made to dead people, reports the Washington Post. IRS officials raised concerns about the issue before payments were distributed to eligible Americans who'd filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return. But  counsel determined they did not have the legal authority to deny payments to people who had filed a return, even if they were deceased,  per the Post. On May 6, the IRS said payments to deceased or incarcerated individuals must be returned—but it doesn't yet have a plan in place for recouping the money, according to the Government Accountability Office report released Thursday. The IRS has now agreed to  consider cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return payments,  as recommended in the report. Meanwhile, Congress is directed to grant Treasury access to the full set of death records and  require that Treasury consistently use it, to help reduce similar types of improper payments.",$1.4B in Stimulus Money Went to Dead People,$____B in Stimulus Money Went to Dead People,1.4,Copy( 1.4 ),0

Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims’ identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash.

John Slowik was named the company's compliance officer in 2009, but he soon started registering complaints about doctors and hospital administrators receiving grants, costly trips, and other entertainment—which NPR says included spa treatments and hot air balloon rides—to woo them to buy Olympus' medical equipment. He was fired in 2010 and filed a lawsuit against the company, noting his complaints about the equipment (specifically, endoscopes to check out the digestive tract) fell on deaf ears, NBC News reports. Because he filed the suit on behalf of the federal government, which CNN notes was getting ripped off by the scheme, Slowik is entitled under the False Claims Act to part of any recovered money. Slowik says negative reaction to his complaints came all the way from the top: Per his suit, he says Mark Gumz, who was the Olympus CEO when Slowik was made compliance officer, told him to  try to figure out how to 'work around the rules' so as to 'not impact the business.'  When instead Slowik tried to rein in the bribery and kickbacks he discovered, he says Gumz started to  ostracize and harass  him, to the point where he became physically ill. Such kickbacks and bribes could  improperly influence a provider's judgment about a patient's health care needs, result in the use of inferior or overpriced equipment, and drive up health care costs for everybody,  the DoJ's deputy AG says, per CNN.

The Gallup poll, believed to be the largest ever aimed at calculating the LGBT population, interviewed more than 121,000 people. The findings upend some stereotypes about the community.  If you spend a lot of time watching network television, you would think most LGBT people are rich white men who live in big cities,  the poll report's lead author tells USA Today.  These data suggest the LGBT community reflects more of the diversity in the US.  In fact, LGBT identification is highest among younger, non-white, less educated people. Percentages of those considering themselves LGBT range from 3.2% of whites to 4.6% of African-Americans. Slightly more women (3.6%) than men (3.3%) generally identified themselves as LGBT. The range was far wider among people ages 18 to 29, with 8.3% of women and 4.6% of men considering themselves LGBT. The ultra-conservative American Research Council squawked that while the LGBT population may be 3.4% of America, they  seem to enjoy 100% accommodation.","Poll: 3.4% of US Adults Are Gay, Bisexual, Transgender","Poll: ____% of US Adults Are Gay, Bisexual, Transgender",3.4,Copy( 3.4 ),0

The storm, which the National Weather Service said likely produced a tornado, hit the east side of Van Zandt County and the city of Van around 8:45pm last night. Chuck Allen, the Van Zandt County fire marshal and emergency management coordinator, says approximately 26 patients were transported to hospitals after a triage area was established at a church.  Damages range from completely destroyed homes, damaged homes, to trees and power lines down,  Allen says, estimating 30% of the city suffered some kind of damage. Allen says authorities are going door to door in the city about 70 miles southeast of Dallas, performing a second search for additional injured individuals. Utility companies are working to restore  vital infrastructures,  and road and bridge crews are working to open streets and highways to allow for first responder access, he says. The storm was part of severe weather that stretched across North Texas yesterday, Earlier in the day, another likely tornado ripped roofs off buildings and damaged trees near Denton, about 40 miles northwest of Dallas.

Johann Rehbogen, 94, isn't accused of a specific crime, but he served at Stutthof concentration camp in what is now Poland. More than 60,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims were killed there—by gas chamber, lethal injection, exposure, starvation, or simply being shot. Rehbogen, who was at the camp from 1942 to 1944, denies knowing about the killings. But others say he had to know:  Anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives,  says prosecutor Andreas Brendel. As he was under 21 at the time, Rehbogen is being tried in juvenile court in Germany and faces a possible 15-year sentence—which he likely wouldn't serve if found guilty due to his age, per the BBC. He's only appearing in court for two hours at a time but seems alert when asked questions by the judge. For the grandson of one survivor, seeing Germany continue to prosecute Holocaust perpetrators is empowering:  Her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure,  says Ben Cohen of his grandmother, Judy Meisel.

The tiny bird easily steals the record for longest continuous flight by spending 10 months in the air without landing once, reports NPR, by way of a study in Current Biology. In 2013, researchers at Sweden's Lund University strapped adult swifts with accelerometers that recorded when the birds flapped their wings and discovered that they spent all but two months of the year aloft, even as they migrated across the equator and back. Some touched down briefly, probably during bad weather, but, overall, more than 99% of the 10-month nonbreeding period was spent in the sky. That means the fittingly-named birds—their species name, Apus, translates to  footless,  reports Discover—ate moths and other insects to sustain themselves while in the air. It's clear they saved energy gliding on rising air, but researchers say it's possible they slept, too. Except to lay their eggs and raise their young, which swifts do for the other two months of the year,  there is no need for them to [land] unless … they encounter very bad weather,  study author Anders Hedenström says, per the Los Angeles Times. Actually, swifts are rather clumsy on the ground and their wings and feet not well suited to taking off from a flat surface, reports National Geographic, so it's safer for them up in the air.

"(Nov 14, 2014  11:40 AM) The co-author of a new study estimates that 25% of our planet's mammals practice infanticide—and she thinks she knows why. Elise Huchard and Dieter Lukas studied 260 species; in about 45% of them, babies are killed by male adults. And it all boils down to sex, says Huchard. In species where a few males tend to prevail over others as mates, adult males kill the babies—though not their own—so the mom is available for mating. In the case of Chacma baboons, for example, as many as half the infants are killed by adult males, notes Lukas. Reuters, which calls the study the  most detailed to date  on the practice, reports that infanticide is most commonly seen in species that live in groups, versus those that are solitary. Among its practitioners: mice, squirrels, lions, horses, hippos, and gorillas. But Mom has a Jerry Springer-style trick up her sleeve. The females of some species, such as the mouse lemur, essentially sleep around. By mating with a lot of males in a short period, they breed confusion about the baby's paternity, the Telegraph reports. After all,  males stop killing offspring if there is a risk that the offspring might be their own,  Lukas says. Instead, males try to produce larger amounts of sperm to guarantee they reproduce; mouse lemur testicles can balloon to 10 times their normal size around breeding time. Another nuance: The researchers found that the practice wasn't observed in mammals that reproduced seasonally, as the males would need to hold off on mating until the breeding season arrived to mate, reports Smithsonian, which notes that females commit infanticide, too. Huchard and Lukas will be studying them next. (A study claims human monogamy is tied to infanticide.)",Why 25% of Mammals Commit Infanticide,Why ____% of Mammals Commit Infanticide,25,Copy( 25 ),0

CNBC reports the city of Boston is the latest to drop Fisher, withdrawing nearly $250 million in pension assets, joining Michigan, which has taken back $600 million from the firm, and Philadelphia, which pulled out $54 million. That's nearly $1 billion of the $112 billion the firm oversees. Fidelity Investments, meanwhile, is mulling whether to yank $500 million of its assets, with a spokesman saying the company is  very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments.  CNBC reports the world first got wind of Ken Fisher's remarks when Alex Chalekian, an attendee at the Tiburon CEO Summit, tweeted last Wednesday,  I'm truly disgusted.  Chalekian posted a selfie video in which he called Fisher's  fireside chat  a  true debacle,  noting Fisher also talked about Jeffrey Epstein and tripping on acid, and that an ex-Fisher employee told him Fisher once said slavery should never have been abolished. CNBC obtained audio from the summit, in which Fisher can be heard advising caution when approaching new clients:  It's like going up to ... a woman in a bar and saying, 'Hey, I want to talk about what's in your pants.

"(Feb 7, 2012  3:36 AM) As politicians in the US debate the merits of smaller government, Greece's creditors are forcing it to shrink its public sector. Greece has agreed to cut 15,000 government jobs by the end of this year, and 150,000—a fifth of the total—by the end of 2015. Greece's constitution protects public sector workers from being fired, so the cuts will have to come from forced retirements, and from the shrinking or even elimination of some public sector entities, the New York Times notes. Without the job cuts and other austerity measures, including a 20% pay cut for public sector workers, the IMF and Greece's eurozone partners are threatening to withhold a $171 billion bailout loan, without which Greece will default on existing loans. The creditors want all three of Greece's major parties to agree to a deal now to prevent backsliding after elections this spring. News of the job cuts was greeted with yet more unrest on the streets of Athens, and the country's two major umbrella unions declared a nationwide general strike. Riot police fired tear gas to repel hundreds of anti-austerity protesters trying to break a cordon outside Parliament, but no arrests or injuries were reported and the clashes quickly subsided.

"(Dec 30, 2019  11:39 AM) William Husel was indicted in June on 25 counts of murder, but the Ohio doctor is hitting back with a lawsuit against his former employer. In his defamation lawsuit against Mount Carmel Health System and its parent organization, Trinity Health Corp., Husel says the 25 patients in question died as a result of their illnesses, not because of the fentanyl he ordered for them. The suit also claims Husel, who was hired as a critical care physician in 2013 and won  doctor of the year  in 2014, was never formally trained by Mount Carmel on hospital procedures and did not deviate from the hospital's end-of-life care policy. Per WOSU, the suit says statements made by the organizations  conflict with all eye-witness accounts, all scientific evidence, and all scientific and medical literature.  Husel, who pleaded not guilty, is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, the AP reports.  It would not be an exaggeration to state that Dr. Husel has suffered perhaps the most egregious case of defamation in Ohio's recent history,  the lawsuit states. But Mount Carmel and Trinity Health say  an extensive review of patient care provided by  Husel was completed and that officials  stand by our decisions.  Mount Carmel previously said Husel was found to have ordered  significantly excessive and potentially fatal  painkiller doses for dozens of patients who were near death; more than two dozen lawsuits have been filed alleging Husel hastened patients' deaths.

The harvest moon is the full moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox each year, the Old Farmer's Almanac explains; this year's equinox, which marks the first day of autumn, falls on September 23. As CNN explains, during a harvest moon, the moon is positioned at its  most shallow angle  with the eastern horizon, meaning there is less time between the sunset and the moon's rise—typically just 25 minutes in most of the northern US, half the time that usually elapses between the two. That occurs for several nights, giving farmers bright moonlight to work in the early evening right around the fall harvesting time. As for why the harvest moon often looks reddish-orange, that's because the closer to the horizon the moon gets, the more red it appears, thanks to the way light photons travel through atmosphere. Not only is the timing of this year's harvest moon rare—CNET reports a nationwide full moon hasn't fallen on a Friday the 13th since 2000, and won't again until 2049—but it's a  micro moon.  The moon will be near its apogee, the point in its orbit at which it is the farthest away from Earth. So it will look 14% smaller than a typical full moon; per NBC News, it will also appear slightly dimmer. The Farmers' Almanac reports that the moon will actually turn full just after midnight Saturday in the Eastern time zone; for the rest of the country, that moment will occur before midnight.

The Post, for instance, tells the story of a 26-year-old woman killed nearly four years ago while driving a 2001 Honda Civic that had been turned into a rental car.  We're good at repairing vehicles, but finding and convincing customers of older model vehicles to complete recalls, now that has proved a difficult challenge,  says a VP for Honda North America.","62,307 'Ticking Time Bombs' Are on US Roads",____ 'Ticking Time Bombs' Are on US Roads,"62,307","Copy( 62,307 )",0

"(Jul 31, 2018  11:47 AM CDT) Keith King says no amount of money could make up for his busted marriage. Nonetheless, a North Carolina judge has ordered his wife's lover to pay him $8.8 million. The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called  alienation of affection,  reports WSOC. In this case, the 48-year-old King claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old Danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports WRAL and Inside Edition.  I've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings,  says King, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between King and Francisco Huizar that was recorded, followed by King learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this.  My marriage was murdered,  says King. Last week, a Durham County judge agreed, ordering Huizar to pay $2.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in North Carolina each year settled out of court. But this was  a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors,  King's attorney tells WRAL. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property. It's  archaic … and should be stricken,  says Huizar's lawyer, who claims King was controlling of his unhappy wife.  Verdicts like these … remove personal responsibility for a person's own marriage.  Huizar plans to appeal.

"(Nov 16, 2015  5:50 PM) Rapid treatment is of utmost importance for babies diagnosed with infantile spasms, also known as West syndrome, a form of epilepsy that causes seizures and corresponding abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain. About half of the babies with it don't respond to the first drug that's tried, meaning doctors then use an injectable drug called Synacthen Depot, which one doctor says works 90% of the time. But Synacthen Depot is the latest drug to cause an uproar after a massive price hike, at least in Canada, CBC reports.  The price of Synacthen Depot increased by more than 2,000% from $33.05 per vial to $680 per vial,  says a spokesperson for Alberta Health, which delisted the drug in July. That means it won't be automatically paid for by Canada's government-subsidized health care anymore, TheStreet explains, though exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis. And as for the price, Fusion explains that the drug requires a six-week course, for a total cost of $14,280. Officials in other Canadian provinces saw a similar hike in the cost of the drug.  This was just dropped like a bombshell,  says a Toronto neurologist who is incensed by the price increase. Pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt owns the rights to the drug in Canada after acquiring another company last year, and a rep says the drug was losing money when the company acquired it.  They just bought it and jacked up the price,  says the neurologist.

A second man, Daniel Martinez, who is believed to have driven the getaway car, according to the AP, has also been charged with kidnapping and burglary. The full details of what cops are calling an  unspeakably traumatic attack  by Summers, who remains at large, have been released—you can read the full 34-page complaint at the LA Weekly (though you may not want to). Police believe that Summers broke into the girl's home with the intent of burglary. Instead, he kidnapped her at knifepoint and took her to a nearby vacant house where the complaint alleges he committed a number of sex acts and took nude photos of the girl. She was found in a parking lot 10 hours later, bruised, barefoot, and disoriented. Both Summers and Martinez have long criminal histories, but neither is a registered sex offender; cops say Martinez left before Summers attacked the girl.

Although Obama has visited mosques overseas in the past, he waited until his final year in office to make such a visit at home, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, reports the AP. At the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama sat down around a large table with Muslim university chaplains, community activists, and public health professionals for a discussion about religious tolerance and freedom. An afternoon speech will address how the US can more successfully confront extremism if it works with Muslims instead of branding all of them as potential enemies. One of the participants meeting with Obama, Ibtihaj Muhammad, has qualified for a spot on the United States Olympic Team for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.

The New York Police Department has banned the practice since 1993, but recently, the Civilian Complaint Review Board says, the NYPD has  failed to charge officers  when they break the rule.  Any pressure to the throat  that could  prevent breathing  is officially considered a chokehold, but the department hasn't been acting against officers unless breathing is actually affected, the Journal notes, per the report. The department's  crystal-clear prohibition has been degraded over the course of the last decade,  the report says. But some police leaders question the report's findings.

Authorities say they are conducting a full investigation and they do not believe the vaccines were the cause of the deaths, reports the BBC. Officials say the fatalities include a 17-year-old boy who died two days after being vaccinated. The others were mostly in their 70s or 80s and had underlying health conditions.  We have not found a direct connection between these deaths and vaccines, or a relationship between the deaths and adverse effects reported after flu shots,  Jung Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said Wednesday, per the New York Times.  We don't think that the situation calls for the suspending of the inoculation program,  Jung said, though some lawmakers argue otherwise, saying doubts about the flu vaccine could increase resistance to a COVID vaccine later. Some 13 million South Koreans have received flu shots as part of a program to inoculate up to 30 million of the country's 51 million people to avoid major flu outbreaks during the coronavirus pandemic.

Even on the day that Andrew Beaujon would set his eyes upon it, he had to pass through a security gate, drive a mile to its host building at Virginia's Fort Belvoir, then get inside a vault. There, he found the bust looking  less than menacing  with 70-year-old dents from boot kicks and the word  FOOL  written on the side. But opinions can change. That's part of the reason this item—one of 586 Nazi-era art pieces in Fort Belvoir's collection—is cloaked in near secrecy, Beaujon writes in a 3,500-word feature at the Washingtonian. As the curator of the collection explains,  There's a very narrow line that we have to walk because we certainly don't want it to be a rallying point for Nazism.  Neither did Gordon Gilkey, a  real-life Indiana Jones  who was instructed by the Chief Military Historian's office to seize all Nazi militaristic art in Germany after World War II, Beaujon writes. In his travels from an Austrian bar to a Bavarian castle, Gilkey uncovered 8,722 art pieces, most of which were returned to Germany after 1982 based on a historian's assessment that they were  laughable to all but the lunatic fringe.  The bust and four paintings by Hitler were among the  most heinous  pieces kept in US possession, and Beaujon notes recent neo-Nazi rallies mean the  conviction that these pieces were laughable feels a little less persuasive today,  even as the National Museum of the United States Army prepares to open at Fort Belvoir in 2019.

The move comes after South Africa last week notified the UN secretary-general it would leave the court; withdrawal takes effect a year after the notification is received.

She died a slave at 60, hours before the war to end slavery unofficially came to a close. Or maybe not: A century and a half later, Reynolds' story is being rewritten. Newly discovered records show that she lingered for several days—long enough to have died a free woman. This new historical narrative has made Reynolds one of the central figures in commemorative activities marking Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia, starting today. Friday night, a eulogy will be delivered over a plain wooden coffin representing Reynolds' remains, and 4,600 candles will be lit to represent the slaves in Appomattox County who were emancipated by Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses Grant. Genealogist Alfred L. Jones III says the Reynolds story was  hidden in plain sight.  Reynolds was left by her masters, Dr. Samuel Coleman and his wife, Amanda Abbitt Coleman, in their home as Union and Confederate armies headed to the fateful battle, the final one before Lee's Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865. During the fighting, a Union cannonball blasted through the house, striking Reynolds and leaving a horrific wound in her arm. Jones worked for months seeking out the thin paper trail left by Reynolds. The breakthrough was finding Reynolds listed on a death registry in a public library in Lynchburg.  That was just like I struck gold,  he says of the document that listed the date of her death as April 12, 1865—not three days earlier, as was long believed.","After 147 Years, Civil War Slave's Story Rewritten","After ____ Years, Civil War Slave's Story Rewritten",147,"Subtract( 2012 , 1865 )",1

"(Apr 8, 2012  9:34 AM CDT) Police backed by a helicopter arrested two white men early today and said they would face murder charges in the recent shootings that terrorized Tulsa's black community and left three people dead and two critically wounded. A police spokesman said Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, were arrested at a home just north of Tulsa about 2am today and were expected to be charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of shooting with intent to kill. He said police acted on an anonymous tip. While police identified the men as white and all the victims are black, authorities have not described the shootings as racially motivated. Community leaders, however, expressed concern—as well as relief at the arrests.  The community once again can go about its business without fear of there being a shooter on the streets, on Easter morning,  says the president of Tulsa NAACP. Police said they linked the shootings because they happened about the same time within a few miles of each other.  There obviously still is a lot of investigation  ahead, said the spokesman.  We don't have a motive at this time. We are still asking questions and hopefully that will become clear in coming days.",Cops Bust 2 in Okla. Shootings,Cops Bust ____ in Okla. Shootings,2,Copy( 2 ),0

She fled to the attic with two dogs and a cat and waited. She smelled natural gas. Then, the house blew up. Belinda Scott was able to break a vent and get out onto a porch, then make it onto a tree, which she clung to for hours before being rescued by state police, Ronnie Scott told the AP on Friday. His wife was in the hospital with burns on 67% of her body. The pets did not make it out alive.  My wife was out there four and a half hours hanging in a tree with a house burning right beside her, flood waters running all around her,  said Scott, who was not at the White Sulphur Springs home when the waters rose.

About 500 people were stranded overnight in a shopping center when a bridge washed out, and dozens of other people had to be plucked off rooftops or rescued from their car.  Our focus remains on search and rescue,  the governor said during a news conference. He added:  It's been a long 24 hours and the next 24 hours may not be much easier.  The deaths included an 8-year-old boy and a 4-year-old boy who were swept away in rushing creek waters in different counties, authorities said.

"(Nov 24, 2018  1:30 PM) An undocumented man's arrest triggered a public demonstration by over two dozen supporters who were hauled off by the cops, ABC 11 reports. Samuel Oliver-Bruno, 47, was arrested Friday by ICE at a Morrisville, NC, office for US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Oliver-Bruno apparently believed he was there to provide fingerprints as part of his petition for deferred deportation, but ICE was ready:  The plainclothes ICE officers forced Samuel into a van in the rear of the office, where supporters who were waiting outside the office rushed to block the vehicle,  says the immigrants-rights group Alerta Migratoria. When supporters refused to budge, 27 were arrested, including Oliver-Bruno's 19-year-old son Daniel Oliver-Perez. Some backstory: Oliver-Bruno moved from Mexico to Greenville in 1994 and was arrested when he tried re-entering the US in 2014 for his wife's open-heart surgery, per the News & Observer. He was convicted and slated to be removed but for  a variety of appeals and acts of discretion,  says ICE. Eleven months ago he moved into a church, knowing ICE doesn't arrest people in churches, hospitals, or schools—but put himself at risk by entering the USCIS office.  Samuel's sudden and inappropriate arrest in the middle of the Thanksgiving season reflects the callous and cruel approach we've come to expect from the Trump administration,  say two NC Congress members calling for his release. ICE says Oliver-Bruno can stay in US detention while his case is adjudicated. (Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's migration comments are causing a stir.)",ICE Nabs Undocumented Man.

"(Jul 13, 2016  12:38 AM CDT) More than two dozen people were sickened in an apparent mass drug overdose on a New York City street corner, sparking warnings from police and health officials about the dangers of using K2, also known as synthetic marijuana. Calls started coming in Tuesday morning that numerous people appeared to be overdosing in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, the AP reports. Witnesses reported seeing victims lying on the sidewalk, shaking, and leaning against trees and fire hydrants. At least 33 people were taken to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, police say. It was not immediately clear what drugs the victims had ingested, but police say some of the victims had been smoking K2. The Health Department issued a statement saying it  recorded a spike in K2-related emergency room visits  connected to the incident in Brooklyn. The department says it's investigating and monitoring emergency rooms across the city.  We remind New Yorkers that K2 is extremely dangerous,  the Health Department said in its statement.  The city's public awareness efforts and aggressive enforcement actions over the past year have contributed to a significant decline in ER visits related to K2.  The drug affects the same area of the brain as marijuana, but it contains chemicals made in labs and sprayed onto dry leaves. These chemicals are not derived from the marijuana plant, according to the Health Department.

Our nationwide search shows it was the largest individual suit involving one scoutmaster,  Brooke Goff, attorney for the plaintiffs, tells the Ridgefield Press. According to the Courant, the lawsuit claims Donald Dennis abused the scouts—who were between the ages of 11 and 17—at his home, at the church where the troop met, and on camping trips. It also states he forced two girls to watch him abuse the scouts at his home. Goff says Dennis molested one of the plaintiffs more than 1,000 times. The 19 plaintiffs are suing the Boy Scouts of America, as well as two local chapters, the Courant reports. According to the Press, Dennis died at 84 two years ago, and the plaintiffs aren't seeking any damages from his estate. The lawsuit claims the organization's leaders knew—or at least should have known—Dennis was a danger to the children, the AP reports.

Alan Gross had been working in Cuba to set up Internet access without local censorship for its small Jewish community, but the Cuban government considered such work subversive and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. The US Agency for International Development said in a statement yesterday that an agreement with Development Alternatives Inc. of Bethesda, Md., had been made final this week. Although the statement didn't specify the amount Gross was to be paid, a USAID spokesman said it was $3.2 million. The USAID statement said that the agreement would resolve claims pending before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals for unanticipated claims under a cost-reimbursement contract, including claims related to Gross. The USAID spokesman, speaking anonymously, said DAI had sought $7 million; DAI didn't respond to an email seeking comment. USAID said the settlement  avoids the cost, delay, and risks of further proceedings, and does not constitute an admission of liability by either party.  In November a federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of a suit filed against the US government by Gross and his wife. They had sued for negligence, arguing that the government sent him into a situation it knew was dangerous.

The RNC says it has paid more than $230,000 to two members of Trump's legal team, but the money comes from a legal proceedings account, which is separate from funds used for political work, Politico reports. An RNC official tells the AP that the committee has also paid almost $200,000 toward Donald Trump Jr.'s legal fees, including $30,000 for an attorney who helped prepare him for Senate testimony earlier this month. Under a law created in 2014, the national committees of both parties were allowed to establish legal proceedings accounts to cover the expenses of election recounts and other legal matters. Donors are allowed to contribute a maximum of $100,200.

Per a DOJ release, Santwon Antonio Davis, 34, is accused of defrauding the unnamed company by falsely claiming he had COVID-19 and fabricating medical records. The AP lays out the details of Davis' alleged scam, which started on March 19 when he claimed to supervisors at the company—which had told workers they'd get paid time off to quarantine if they tested positive—that his mother had been exposed to someone who had COVID-19, per an FBI agent's statement. Davis was told he was  low risk  and could still work, and his story soon started to evolve. Over the next few days, per the agent's statement, he first told a supervisor his mom had developed symptoms, then that she'd tested positive, then that he'd tested positive. When the company asked for his test results, he allegedly sent over a phony medical letter, which the company suspected was fake. They kept asking for his test results, which he never sent; he was eventually fired. In the meantime, the company shut down on March 23 to clean, paying its employees during the shutdown. It also made four of Davis' co-workers quarantine and paid them during that time.  The defendant caused unnecessary economic loss to his employer and distress to his co-workers and their families,  US Attorney Byung J.  BJay  Pak said in the release.

Leston Lawrence, 35, was known to set off the Mint's metal detectors more often than most, but he always passed a search with a hand-held wand, according to prosecutors. They say that's because Lawrence smuggled coins and 18 unmarked gold nuggets out of the Mint hidden in his rectum, then took them to a gold buyer, where he received checks for about $5,000 per piece between November 2014 and March 2015, reports the Ottawa Citizen. After noticing the high number of checks, however, a bank teller discovered Lawrence worked at the Mint and alerted authorities, prosecutors say. The Mint—where  gold is left sitting around in open buckets,  says Lawrence's lawyer, Gary Barnes—could find no record of the alleged thefts, but investigators say they found four nuggets in Lawrence's possession after executing a search warrant. The nuggets are in the shape of the Mint's  dipping spoon,  which is not available commercially, notes the newspaper. Investigators also found Vaseline in Lawrence's work locker. A security employee proved one could pass a security check with a hand-held wand while smuggling gold via the butt, investigators say. Still, Barnes argues there's no proof Lawrence's gold came from the Mint, per the Toronto Sun.

ABC News calls his endorsement  much sought after,  and notes that Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, and Mitt Romney also courted him. But in the Atlantic, Andrew Cohen wonders,  Why would anyone want Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s endorsement?  The fact that the candidates competed for Arpaio  is just one of the many mind-bending absurdities of the 2012 race.  Sure, the sheriff is nationally known,  but he's made a terrible mess of his own job in Maricopa County, which is littered with litigation over his policies and practices.","Sheriff Joe Arpaio Backs Rick Perry for 2012, Will Announce Endorsement Next Week: Source","Sheriff Joe Arpaio Backs Rick Perry for ____, Will Announce Endorsement Next Week: Source",2012,Copy( 2012 ),0

"(Aug 29, 2019  12:53 PM CDT) A one-legged skeleton found under a Russian dance floor could solve a mystery that has persisted since 1812. Charles-Étienne Gudin, whom the BBC refers to as Napoleon Bonaparte's  favorite general,  was hit by a cannonball during the failed French invasion of Russia that year; he had his leg amputated, but died three days later from gangrene. His heart was removed by the French army and returned to Paris to be buried, but no one knew where his skeleton lay—until, possibly, now.  As soon as I saw the skeleton with just one leg, I knew that we had our man,  the head of the Russian and French archaeological team that found the remains, buried in a wooden coffin in Smolensk, tells AFP. DNA testing is being done to confirm the identification; a Gudin descendant says the family hopes he can eventually be buried alongside Napoleon. The archaeologists say the skeleton had injuries consistent with those Gudin suffered, and preliminary results indicate the remains were those of a man between the ages of 40 and 45 when he died. Gudin, a veteran of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars whose name is inscribed on Paris' Arc de Triomphe, was 44. The size of the body is also a match. The team started looking for Gudin's remains in May, using the memoirs of another Napoleonic-era French general to narrow down the location before using the account of another witness to find the actual coffin, buried in a park underneath a building foundation.  For this to be validated 100%, it must be done in France, not Russia,  said the project leader, who added that he has asked the Marseille Forensic Institute to repatriate the body and perform DNA tests.",Could Skeleton Found Under a Dance Floor Solve 1812 Mystery?,Could Skeleton Found Under a Dance Floor Solve ____ Mystery?,1812,Copy( 1812 ),0

At the current rate of job creation, for instance, it would take nine years to recapture jobs lost thus far. Home prices, meanwhile, are down 20% since 2005; even assuming 2% inflation, it would take 13 years for the market to reach pre-crisis levels. Everywhere, offices sit empty.  No wonder Americans are pessimistic and unhappy,  one economist says. America must  face up to the reality that we are entering a period of austerity.  The Times calls this era the  New Normal,  a time defined by debt, unemployment, and uncertainty.

Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting explains: San Diego man Osbaldo Padron claims he was sexually abused as a child in the 1990s by an adult congregation member and filed suit against the Jehovah's Witnesses for not interceding and continuing to promote the man. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports the church allegedly knew in 1982 that Gonzalo Campos had molested a child; Campos later admitted to abusing at least eight kids between that year and 1995 (he fled to Mexico in 2010). Padron wants internal documents that he believes show a pattern, and the church won't hand them over, in violation of a court order. Hence the $4,000 daily penalty; the order was upheld on appeal last week. Reveal offers details on internal documents it was able to obtain, which reach back three decades and include a 1989 letter sent to all congregations from HQ, known as the Watchtower, noting that elders  must be careful not to divulge information about personal matters to unauthorized personnel.  A 1997 letter decried molestation but instructed on how to handle a  former child molester  moving to a new congregation: send a letter about any  needed cautions  in a  Special Blue  envelope to the new congregation's elders, but  this letter should not be read to or discussed with the congregation.

"(Nov 17, 2016  5:03 PM) A judge in Atlanta on Thursday ordered Bobbi Kristina Brown's partner, Nick Gordon, to pay $36 million in a wrongful death case, her estate's lawyers said. Brown, the daughter of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in her suburban Atlanta townhome in January 2015. Gordon, who also lived there, and a friend were listed on the police report as being in the home when investigators arrived there. She was in a coma for six months before dying in hospice care at age 22 on July 26, 2015. Gordon was held legally responsible for her death in September. Investigators with the medical examiner's office were unable to determine exactly how Brown had died. An autopsy showed she had morphine, cocaine, alcohol, and prescription drugs in her body. But the medical examiner couldn't determine if she killed herself, if someone else killed her, or if her death was accidental. Fulton County Superior Court Judge T. Jackson Bedford ruled in September that Gordon repeatedly failed to meet court deadlines in the civil suit. His order said that means the conservator of her estate wins by default. Bedford on Thursday awarded damages of $36,250,000, the AP reports. Bobby Brown and his daughter, LaPrincia Brown, Bobbi Kristina Brown's half-sister, were among the witnesses who testified at Thursday's hearing. The young woman's family blamed Gordon, accusing him in the lawsuit of giving Brown a  toxic cocktail  before putting her face-down in the water.

"(May 2, 2016  3:40 PM CDT) Astronomers searching for life beyond our solar system may need to look no farther than a little, feeble, nearby star. A Belgian-led team reported Monday that it's discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star less than 40 light-years away. It's the first time planets have been found around this type of star—and it opens up new, rich territory in the search for extraterrestrial life. Because this star is so close and so faint, astronomers can study the atmospheres of these three temperate exoplanets and, eventually, hunt for signs of possible life. They're already making atmospheric observations, in fact, using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope will join in next week. Altogether, it's a  winning combination  for seeking chemical traces of life outside our solar system, says MIT researcher Julien de Wit, a co-author of the study, released by the journal Nature. The star in question—named Trappist-1 after the Belgian telescope in Chile that made the discovery—is barely the size of Jupiter and located in the constellation Aquarius. Other exoplanet searches have targeted bigger, brighter stars more like our sun, but the starlight in these cases can be so bright that it washes out the signatures of planets. By comparison, cool dwarf stars that emit infrared light, like Trappist-1, make it easier to spot potential worlds. University of Liege astronomers in Belgium built the Trappist telescope to observe 60 of the nearest ultra-cool dwarf stars and, de Wit notes, the risky effort paid off.",3 Surprise Planets Could Host ETs,____ Surprise Planets Could Host ETs,3,Copy( 3 ),0

A new study out of Australia finds that women are more likely to find a man desirable if he's already had one or two partners, the country's ABC News reports.  There appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner,  say the authors—amusingly, their study, published in Human Nature, is titled  I Want What She's Having.  The phenomenon is known as  mate copying,  and researchers already knew animals practiced it, but wanted to see if it played a role in human mate selection.  A man seeking a mate can get a lot of the information he needs just by observing his potential mate, but ... females are not as superficial as males,  the lead author explains. They need to assess things like whether their partner will be a good parent or whether he'll stay committed; that's likely why they look for a male who's already been  road-tested  by other females and is thus more likely to have these desirable traits. But don't take it too far, guys: The researchers asked 123 women to rate the desirability of men using photos that noted the number of relationships they've racked up in four years, and  when you go to five, the guy becomes really undesirable.

Then it took another quarter-century for tests to be funded and performed, but they're now telling the story of Racton Man in pretty gritty detail. He lived around 4,200 years ago, was in his 40s at the time of his death, and was likely a prominent warrior who died in battle, reports the Guardian. He managed to live well past the average life expectancy of his time but was suffering the effects (spinal degeneration, tooth decay, and a chronic sinus infection), and the bronze dagger he held is thought to be the earliest ever found in the UK.  Dagger burials of any kind are rare, and these daggers are hens’ teeth rare,  says an expert on Bronze Age metalwork.  It was a very short-lived fashion, certainly no more than a few generations.  Thanks to isotope analysis on Racton Man's teeth, scientists say he grew up in southern Britain, and thanks to radiocarbon dating, he was found to have lived during the Bronze Age, reports the BBC.

"(Jun 27, 2018  2:32 PM CDT) For some 3.2 million Americans who work in the private sector, it has apparently seemed like a good deal: Lock in their monthly federal student-loan payments at 10% of their discretionary income. Make those payment for 20 years (25 if it's graduate school debt, notes Forbes). Hit that date and see whatever is left wiped away—and there might be a ton left, as the payments are often smaller than the interest that's being accrued. The Wall Street Journal reports these  income-driven repayment plans  have been available through the Education Department since 2007, meaning balances won't start going to zero until 2027. And when they do, expect a  bomb.  That's because the balance that's forgiven is considered income for that year, meaning the borrower has to pay tax on it. The Journal does the math: One estimate expects such borrowers to have $41,000 forgiven on average. At a 25% income tax rate, that would mean a $10,250 tax bill. On the more eye-popping end of the spectrum, it references an orthodontist it interviewed who had student-loan debt in excess of $1 million; that associated tax bill could be $700,000. (Forbes notes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program doesn't levy taxes on the forgiven amount).  I'm very doubtful that everybody is going to be able to make these tax payments,  said Constantine Yannelis, who worked in the Treasury Department under Obama. The IRS could place liens on homes or garnish Social Security checks, but some experts expect that as 2027 approaches, Congress will see heavy pressure to act; eliminating the tax could put taxpayers on the hook for billions in student-loan costs.",A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in 2027,A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in ____,2027,Copy( 2027 ),0

They're looking for spots where at least three states (or Canadian provinces) meet, such as the Connecticut-Rhode Island-Massachusetts point. Brian Butler of Holliston, Massachusetts, has created a website devoted to the hobby, the AP reports. He says there are 65 sites in the US where at least three states intersect, 38 of them on land. Some, like the one in southern New England, are marked with monuments. Others have survey markers in the ground, and others aren't marked at all.

While machinery has been unable to get beyond 262 feet due to hard rock, rescue teams at the site in Totalan, Spain, as of Wednesday had  scientific evidence  the boy is at the bottom, reports the AP: DNA tests show that a number of hairs pulled from the well's soil belong to Julen (also reported as Yulen). In addition, a robotic camera that couldn't make it past 229 feet due to how narrow the well is on Monday spotted a bag of sweets the toddler had been carrying when he vanished during a countryside lunch. An effort is now underway to carefully dig an intersecting tunnel; the expectation is that rescuers will access the bottom of the well via that tunnel by Friday.

The British hairdresser says she planned to transfer her monthly pay of about $1,500 to her husband's account, but mis-typed one digit of his account number. The heartbreaker: They only noticed the error two years later, after losing $42,000. And the bank, Nationwide, refuses to return the money, the Guardian reports. The bank argues that the lucky recipient has already withdrawn the money from ATMs, so getting it back is impossible. And the transfers are hardly the bank's fault.  Phone calls to Nationwide that night, many tears, and numerous subsequent calls and letters, have left us with just £1,000 returned,  says Donaldson—which isn't her real name.

Unsurprisingly, Haag, who's from the Chicago area, grew up playing video games—a lot of them. His father calls him something of a  loner,  but when it came to gaming, he would yell at fellow players to keep up. As a young teenager, he attended video game events, but it wasn't until recently that he started raking in cash; three years back, the Times notes, he was working at McDonald's. While video game competitions bring him some money, the key to his success is his online presence.

A two-sentence statement issued by the Navy said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, had relieved Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin  due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.  The move follows four Navy accidents in the Pacific since late January, including two collisions that left sailors dead and missing.  While each of these four incidents is unique, they cannot be viewed in isolation,  Swift said late Tuesday. He said the Navy will carry out a  deliberate re-set  of all its ships in the Pacific, focused on navigation, mechanical systems, and bridge resource management. It will include training and an expert assessment of each ship. The Navy said that Rear Adm. Phillip Sawyer, who had already been named as Aucoin's successor, would assume command immediately. Aucoin assumed command of the 7th Fleet in September 2015 and was due to retire in a few weeks. Seven sailors died in June when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off Japan. On Monday, the destroyer USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided off Singapore, injuring five sailors and leaving 10 others missing.

Mike Parson offered a whole-hearted defense Tuesday of Mark and Patricia McCloskey and said President Trump was also  getting involved  in their case. Declaring that the pair had  every right to protect their property,  Parson said Trump  doesn't like what he sees and the way these people are being treated  and added that Attorney General William Barr will likely  take a look  at the case with Trump.  The president said that he would do everything he could within his powers to help with this situation and he would be taking action to do that,  said Parson. But St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who is prosecuting the case, had little positive to say about Parson and Trump getting involved. She said in a statement that they  came after me for doing my job and investigating a case. While they continue to play politics with the handling of this matter, spreading misinformation and distorting the truth, I refuse to do so.

The Matanuska-Susitna School Board voted 5-2 last week to remove five titles from the list of books teachers can use in elective English classes, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The books stricken are: Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison; Catch-22, by Joseph Heller; The Things They Carried, by Tim O’Brien; I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou; and The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. There was no public comment at the meeting. The objections involve depictions of rape and incest— things that are pretty serious problems, especially in our teenage world,  one school board member said. Another member who voted  yes  said he read a summary of Angelou's book, which had a description of molestation.  If I were to read this in a professional environment at my office, I would be dragged to the equal opportunity office,  he said.

There's just one thing: To buy that $54 million private jet (Duplantis has his eye on a Dassault Falcon 7x), the Louisiana preacher needs his followers to donate money to the cause. As for those aforementioned three jets, the most recent of which was purchased in 2006, the ministry has been  just burning them up for the Lord Jesus Christ,  Duplantis said in the video, per NOLA.com. The Falcon 7x, with a range of 5,950 nautical miles, is needed  so we can go anywhere in the world in one stop,  he explained. None of his other jets can do that. Duplantis told his followers that God told him,  I want you to believe in me for a Falcon 7X.  He said viewers should  pray about becoming a partner to it.  He addressed the possible controversial nature of his request, per WGNO:  Now some people believe that preachers shouldn’t have jets. I really believe that preachers ought to go on every available voice, every available outlet, to get this gospel preached to the world.  He has defended his use of private planes in the past in what the Washington Post calls a  widely mocked  video in which he and another preacher said, among other things, that you can't speak openly to God on a commercial airliner.

For the first time, that law has been used to kill one of the mountain lions wearing a collar as part of the state's 18-year study tracking the creatures. The mountain lion—also known as a cougar or puma—called P-56, a male between 4 and 5 years old, was suspected of multiple attacks on animals at a Camarillo property, CBS News reports. The landowner said 12 animals were killed during nine incidents over a two-year period, and that the landowner had taken multiple preventive measures. Those measures included bringing in livestock and penning animals close to buildings if they couldn't be brought in; using hot wire fencing, motion-activated lights, and radio hazing; and utilizing guard dogs. When none of that worked, he was issued a permit, and officials say P-56 was killed at the end of January.  The loss of a breeding male is a concern for the study, especially when the population is already very small,  the lead field biologist for the tracking project says in a statement.  Currently, there is only one adult male in the Santa Monica Mountains that we are tracking and that is P-63,  though he acknowledges  there are always animals out there that are not being tracked.

A gay man in a civil partnership decided to donate his sperm to a lesbian friend (also in a civil partnership), but a nearly six-year feud between the four parties over their informal deal has left their 9-year-old and 13-year-old daughters  irredeemably marred  by a  sense of mutual loathing  between all of their parents, Justice Cobb wrote in his rulings, per the Independent.

The FBI is calling it the largest human-trafficking case ever charged in US history.  In the old days, they used to keep slaves in their places with whips and chains. Today it’s done with economic threats and intimidation,  an FBI agent said. Two Global Horizons employees have been arrested, a third is expected to turn himself in, and the FBI is currently negotiating the surrender of CEO Mordechai Orian.

"(Sep 27, 2014  6:36 AM CDT) A volcano in Japan rumbled to life today unexpectedly, killing a female hiker, the Japan Times reports. At least 40 people were hurt in the eruption of Mount Ontake in central Japan, the AP reports, and the Times notes that 16 were knocked unconscious, per an official. Seven were said to be missing. The mountain spewed ash and initially trapped about 250 hikers on its slopes, reports Reuters. The eruption occurred at midday local time, and by evening most of the trapped hikers had made it down to safety, reports the AP. Many injured, however, are staying in lodges on the mountain. Given the scope of the smoke and ash plumes, it could take a while to account for everyone.  It was like thunder,  a woman tells broadcaster NHK of the first eruption.  I heard boom, boom, then everything went dark.

Authorities say an 8-year-old girl was among five family members who attacked police headquarters in the city of Surabaya on Monday morning, the Guardian reports. CCTV footage of the attack shows the family arriving on two motorcycles and detonating their explosives at a checkpoint, reports the AP. Police say the only people killed were the four adult family members. The girl was thrown by the blast and is being treated in a local hospital. Four police officers and six civilians were injured in the attack, which President Joko Widodo called  undignified and barbaric.  The police headquarters attack follows Sunday's attacks on three Christian churches in the city, which police say were carried out by members of a single family, including a 9-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl. Police have identified the father as Dita Oepriarto, head of a local ISIS-inspired terror cell. Six family members and eight others died in the three attacks. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and police say the family members were among hundreds of Indonesians to return to the country from Syria after the collapse of ISIS'  caliphate.

I started looking for jobs the best I could,  a teen identified as Jordan tells FOX2 Detroit.  I was ready to donate all my time.  The only problem? His girlfriend's pregnancy was a hoax perpetrated with the help of FakeABaby.com. The 16-year-old girl faked her pregnancy for 10 months, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, sharing ultrasounds, sporting a growing belly, joining a Facebook group for mothers of triplets, and naming her unborn babies Ivan, Alice, and Isabella. The unnamed girl, identified as being from Wyandotte, received thousands of dollars in donations from acquaintances, a church, a nonprofit, and more, according to FOX2. The boyfriend's aunt says there were so many gifts at the baby shower, the girl couldn't open them all. Things started to fall apart for the fake mom-to-be when her boyfriend couldn't figure out why nine months came and went without a birth, and his mom, Krissy Wyrabkiewicz, was unable to confirm the girl's doctor even existed. Then a member of the Facebook group pointed out that the girl's ultrasound pictures looked just like fake ones available on FakeABaby.com. Finally, the day before a supposed C-section scheduled for last week, the girl reportedly said she had lost the triplets. Her boyfriend's family called police when she refused to go to the hospital, and the jig was up. The girl's brother tells FOX2 she really was pregnant but lost the baby at six weeks.  She was scared and didn't know what to do,  he says. Police are now investigating whether her parents were in on it and are looking into possible criminal charges over the gifts and donations.

"(Oct 7, 2015  1:11 PM CDT) It's hard to find a one-way ticket domestically for $69, but if the CEO of Norwegian Air has his way, a ticket for that much may soon be available between Europe and the US, NBC News reports. Bjorn Kjos' master plan is to connect flights from smaller coastal US airports—New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport have both been mentioned—that offer lower fees than busier airports to European destinations such as Bergen, Norway, and Edinburgh, Scotland. It's all part of the budget airline's blueprint to wrest trans-Atlantic market share away from larger airlines such as Lufthansa. Norwegian has 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets on order, with the first five set to arrive in 2017, the Telegraph notes. These planes are capable of flying over the ocean, but are more fuel-efficient and smaller, which would make them a better size for smaller airports like the one in Birmingham, England. Regulators would have to agree to the plan and set up customs stations at those US airports that don't currently handle international flights, but Kjos says he's sure that won't be an issue. A round-trip ticket will likely cost around $300 once all the fees are factored in, but that's still cheaper than the $500 or so that Norwegian's flights in and out of busier airports run, NBC notes.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, writes AJ Daulerio on Deadspin: In both New York and New Jersey, where the romancing allegedly occurred, it’s perfectly legal for a 24-year-old man to date a 17-year-old girl. The girl in question, whom Daulerio refers to only as EK, reached out to Deadspin with her story before changing her mind and deciding she didn’t want the infamy that would come along with its publication—but that didn’t stop Deadspin from running it. EK claims she met Sanchez while partying at a Manhattan nightclub on Dec. 31, and that she was upfront with him about her age. Sanchez texted her and she freaked out about it on Facebook (Deadspin has a screenshot; click to see), then he gave her tickets to the Bills-Jets game. Ultimately, they had a dinner date in New York and then they, in Daulerio’s words,  hooked up.  EK says they  went back to his place in Jersey after dinner,  and as proof, she offers pictures of what she claims is Sanchez’s room.

He was 82. Leibman's agent, Robert Attermann, said the actor died Friday. He gave no further details, but a person who knew the actor said the cause was pneumonia. In his lengthy career, Leibman played a huge variety of roles, both dramatic and comic. He appeared in numerous films, including Norma Rae, opposite Sally Field, and Slaughterhouse-Five. He won an Emmy award in 1979 for the short-lived CBS series Kaz, which he also created. He was perhaps best known on TV, however, for his role on Friends, on which he played Dr. Leonard Green, the father of Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston. He picked up a Tony in 1993 for his performance as conservative lawyer Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner's Angels in America: Millennium Approaches, per Variety. Leibman, who was born Oct. 11, 1937, in New York and attended Ohio Wesleyan University, started his acting career in 1956 on the soap opera The Edge of Night, moving on to his first movie, the comedy Where's Poppa?, in 1970.

The loss was driven largely by frigid conditions in the stratosphere—though surface temperatures were actually warmer than normal—and lingering chemicals banned in 1987's Montreal Protocol.

"(Nov 11, 2014  9:51 AM) In a mass sterilization of 83 women in India on Saturday, a surgeon used infected instruments; now, 10 patients are dead and 69 others have been hospitalized, a local health official tells Bloomberg.  It's a case of negligence,  says the chief minister of Chhattisgarh state, where surgeons are banned from conducting more than 30 such procedures daily. A reproductive rights activist in New Delhi uses starker terms:  Chhattisgarh was a culmination of no accountability in the system and when basic hygiene conditions aren't met,  she says, adding that such circumstances are  commonplace.  The doctor involved, RK Gupta, has been suspended amid a criminal investigation, says the state's chief minister. The district's top health officer says the deaths were a result of  infection causing septic shock  and that it's  too early to say that it was due to sterilization.  All the women were poor villagers younger than 32, the AP reports. They were paid about $10 each to join the sterilization program, the state's chief medical officer says. The surgeries took place within a six-hour period. As the country works toward population control, sterilizations are voluntary. But amid events like single-day sterilization drives, India has the third-highest female sterilization rate in the world—and while 37% of married women have undergone the process, just 1% of men have had vasectomies, a national survey shows. Chhattisgarh state is aiming for 180,000 sterilizations for the 12 months preceding March, the chief medical officer says.",Botched Mass Sterilization in India Kills 10 Women,Botched Mass Sterilization in India Kills ____ Women,10,Copy( 10 ),0

Squitieri tells ABC News that he accidentally tossed the 12.5-carat ring in the trash after it was left in paper towels on the kitchen counter Sunday night. When his wife, Carla, noticed it was missing on Monday, they realized it had been thrown out—and they were told it was on its way to a landfill site that also handles radioactive waste. They convinced Meridian Waste Services to divert the truck to another site, where they faced the daunting task of combing through 10 tons of garbage for the ring.  My first thought was we're never going to find it. It was like finding a needle in a haystack basically,  Joe Evans, the operations manager who drove to the site to help the Squitieris search, tells KMOV. It's very rare for that kind of item to be recovered from the trash, Evans says—but he managed to find the ring within 25 minutes and return it to an extremely relieved couple.  He could've put the ring in his pocket and nobody would've ever noticed,  says Bernie Squitieri, who thinks Evans' honesty is as valuable as the ring.

"(Nov 30, 2012  7:06 AM) Although many Americans express anger at the seemingly ever-increasing amount they have to fork over to Uncle Sam, most actually paid a lesser amount in 2010 than they would have in 1980, according to an analysis by the New York Times that took into account federal, state, and local taxes. From 1980 to 2010 (the most recent available year), those earning more than $200,000 have enjoyed the largest decline in total taxes as a percentage of income, and 85% of households earning more than $25,000 per year have also seen the percentage of their income that goes to taxes drop. The group that got hit hardest? Those earning less than $25,000, only about half of which have seen their tax burden decline. While federal tax rates have been cut across the board since 1980, state and local taxes (which typically take a larger percentage of the lowest earners' income) have increased in most of the country, offsetting much of the federal savings—in six states, local tax increases have exceeded the decline in federal rates. Overall, about 31 cents of each dollar earned goes to the government, about the same as in 1980. However, changes to the tax code have seen the taxes paid by a household earning $350,000 fall to 42.1% from 49% (adjusted for inflation). While a household making $22,000 in 2010 paid a much lower percentage—19.4%—that's much closer to what it was for that household in 1980: 20.2%.","If It Was 1980, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes","If It Was ____, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes",1980,Copy( 1980 ),0

Shalit, now 25, was 19 when he was captured during a cross-border raid in 2006, and his captivity has long been an emotional issue in Israel.

"(Feb 27, 2016  7:39 AM) As daunting as it may seem, you can read Crime and Punishment—20 minutes at a time. Serial Reader is a free iOS app that breaks down dozens of the classics into manageable chunks that are sent to your iPhone or iPad each day at a time you choose, Chris Taylor reports at Mashable. At that rate, the aforementioned Dostoyevsky tome will take you 79 days to read. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein comes in at 28 days. And you could finish The Star Lord by Boyd Ellanby in just 10.  This just might be the reading mode of the future,  Taylor writes. Good e-Reader points out that serialized fiction first became popular in the newspapers of Victorian England. And after decades on the decline, it  is now making a rebound thanks to the iPhone.  Even publisher Simon & Schuster is getting in on the action with an app called Crave, which charges a fee, as do apps Pigeonhole and Rooster. What makes Serial Reader different is that it's free, according to the Washington Post.  Users should know that the key word here is 'classics,'  Hayley Tsukayama writes.  You’re not going to find modern bestsellers.  And if you're the type of reader who likes to skip ahead, she notes, Serial Reader can be frustrating. However, it's an  elegant solution  to the problem of finding time to read. Taylor says he found the 20-minute reading time to be an overestimate—it took him,  not a particularly fast reader,  about 15 minutes to complete a day's reading. Also, he notes, you can download an entire text if you choose. (Not into reading?

But the one that took center stage Friday in Durham, NC, focused on her husband, novelist Mike Peterson, who filed what's called an Alford plea on a voluntary manslaughter charge, more than 15 years after his wife's body was found at the bottom of the stairs in their home, the News & Observer reports. The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in Germany who, like Kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before Kathleen (and whose daughters Mike Peterson ended up raising). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, WRAL and the AP report. A new trial was ordered. The Alford plea entered by Peterson Friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict. He walked out free afterward, though his wife's sister declared in court,  You will be a convicted felon forever.  Peterson had said earlier he didn't want to take the plea, but he didn't think he'd ever get a fair second trial by prosecutors.  I am not going to put my life and my freedom in their hands.

Federal subsidies would cover the cost of these plans, most of which are called bronze policies and are the least expensive plans available, for people whose income is near the Medicaid threshold. But insurers and officials aren't making a big deal about the plans, because there's a big trade-off: People with bronze plans will have to pay higher out-of-pocket costs when they get care. The plans typically cover around 60% of medical costs for the subscriber; like all the other plans, out-of-pocket costs will be limited to $6,350 per year for an individual.  We’re not advertising zero dollar,  says a senior VP at Independence Blue Cross, which offers four such plans. Rather, the company is focusing on promoting plans with very low monthly costs (say, $20 to $30); the White House is taking the same approach. Those who opt for a silver plan can get better coverage, including, in some cases, dental and vision coverage. Of course, it's not all good news today: Remember all those people who will lose their current coverage because it doesn't meet the Affordable Care Act's minimum requirements? The Washington Post reports that many are finding they'll have to accept higher premiums, deductibles, or out-of-pocket maximums on their new plans.

"(Nov 26, 2010  5:33 AM) Some 1% of all deaths worldwide are caused by second-hand smoke, according to the World Health Organization. Researchers say passive smoking results in close to 600,000 deaths a year from heart disease, respiratory diseases, asthma, and lung cancer. It takes an especially heavy toll on children, with 165,000 a year dying from smoke-related respiratory infections, largely in Africa and South Asia. Experts say more needs to be done to educate people about the dangers of smoking in homes with children— they found 40% of children (and more than 30% of non-smoking adults) regularly breathe in secondhand smoke.  It's almost as if people are in denial,  the chief of the British Lung Foundation tells AP.

The toll is expected to rise as authorities move heavy machinery to the scene of the derailment of the train known as  The Beast.  Thousands of migrants ride its roof on their way north each year, braving brutal conditions for a chance at crossing into the US. The Red Cross said an undetermined number of people were trapped. Authorities say eight cars had derailed, but they don't yet know why. The Tabasco state government says at least 250 Honduran migrants were on the train heading north from the Guatemala border. The Red Cross chief in Tabasco described the rescue as  a complex situation  that was making it difficult to get rapid confirmation of the true number of dead and injured.

The coins, bearing the likenesses of dead presidents, were mandated by Congress in 2005 and began production in 2007. But government vaults have built up 1.4 billion of the coins, a number that was set to reach 2 billion by the time the US Mint got to the last president in 2016. Instead, the Mint got through 20 presidents—and when the next one, Chester A. Arthur, is produced, the Mint will only make enough coins to satisfy the demands of collectors.  Nobody wants them,  Joe Biden said yesterday at a meeting about cutting government waste.  And as it will shock you all, the call for Chester A. Arthur coins is not there.  Cutting production will save taxpayers $50 million per year.  These coins are a textbook case of wasteful spending—something Americans just don't want or need,  said Sen. David Vitter.

"(Dec 2, 2016  6:28 AM) Road rage is being blamed for the shooting death of former NFL player Joe McKnight in New Orleans on Thursday. McKnight, 28, who spent three seasons with the Jets and Chiefs and played this year in the Canadian Football League, was shot to death at an intersection, reports the Times-Picayune. It's not clear what led to the shooting, but witnesses say McKnight and another man were arguing outside their vehicles about 2:45pm. One woman tells the newspaper that she heard McKnight trying to apologize for something before being shot. She says the second man then shot him again while he was on the ground. McKnight was pronounced dead at the scene. Police have identified the shooter as 54-year-old Ronald Gasser, who is in custody but has not been charged.  The only thing we know right now, everything else is conjecture, is that Mr. Gasser did in fact shoot Mr. McKnight,  says Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand. McKnight is the second former NFL player this year to die in an incident attributed to road rage in the New Orleans area, notes Tribune News. In April, former Saints player Will Smith was shot to death. McKnight, a running back, also led the league in kick returns in 2011 with a 31.6-yard average while with the Jets.

What's more, the highest officials are to blame for the practices, it says, per the New York Times. In a move unprecedented in American history, President Bush and his administration held  considered and detailed discussions ... on the wisdom, propriety, and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody.  There's no  firm or persuasive evidence  that the torture—including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and throwing people into walls—resulted in useful intelligence that officials couldn't have otherwise learned, says the report, which is based on extensive interviews with officials and detainees.

"(Jun 3, 2019  8:23 AM CDT) Lots of people keep an eye on their fitness trackers as they go about the common mission of getting 10,000 steps daily. A new study, however, suggests that specific goal isn't as important as you might think. Researchers found that benefits in regard to longevity began in earnest at about 4,400 steps daily and leveled off at 7,500, at least among older women, reports NPR. The intensity of those steps didn't seem to matter. The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 17,000 women with a mean age of 72, beginning in 2011. The large study sample, combined with the long follow-up of eight years in some cases, gives the study credibility, writes Nina Shapiro at Forbes. The upshot is that the figure of 10,000 appears to be based more on marketing than science.  I’m not saying don’t get 10,000 steps,  lead researcher I-Min Lee of Harvard's TH Chan School of Public Health tells the Atlantic.  If you can get 10,000 steps, more power to you. But if you’re someone who’s sedentary, even a very modest increase brings you significant health benefits.  A University of Iowa researcher not involved with the study amplifies the latter point.  To me, this study suggests there's more benefit to light activity than we were previously thinking there might be,  Kathleen Janz tells NPR. The study was observational, meaning it didn't definitively link the walking to the boost in longevity, but Lee says it's clear that moderate physical activity (walking or otherwise) is key to a healthy life.

"(Apr 1, 2016  8:13 AM CDT) US employers notched another solid month of hiring in March by adding a higher-than-expected 215,000 jobs, driven by large gains in the construction, retail, and health care industries, the AP reports. Despite the jump, the Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 5% from 4.9%. But that increase includes some good news: More Americans came off the sidelines to look for work, though not all found jobs. The figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff, even as overall growth has slowed since last winter. Steady hiring is also contributing to higher pay, which rose a modest 2.3% from a year earlier to $25.43. That figure has increased since the early years of the recovery but is below a peak of 2.6% reached in December. Sluggish wage growth has been a weak spot in the economy and a source of frustration for many workers since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Paychecks typically grow at a 3.5% pace in a strong economy. Construction firms added 37,000 jobs, likely aided by warmer weather. That helped offset another month of job losses in manufacturing, which has been hit by slower growth overseas, and mining, which includes the oil and gas drilling sector. Low oil prices have cost that industry 185,000 jobs since September 2014. Meanwhile, the MoneyBeat team at the Wall Street Journal has deemed Friday  datageddon  for all of the additional info scheduled to be released, including manufacturing data from the US, China, and Europe and an update from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index.","'Datageddon' Day: 215K More Jobs, but Unemployment Ticks Up","'Datageddon' Day: ____K More Jobs, but Unemployment Ticks Up",215,"Paraphrase( 215,000 , K )",1

Not counting the self-employed and farmworkers, women held 50.04% of all jobs in December, with 109,000 more women on payrolls than men. Of the 145,000 jobs added last month, women nabbed 139,000 of them, per Labor Department stats. The Washington Post notes it's only the second time women have outnumbered the guys: The last time women took the majority like this was during a 10-month stretch between June 2009 and April 2010, right after the Great Recession, when men had trouble keeping jobs in typically male-dominated industries such as construction and manufacturing. Women are also more likely than men to hold more than one job.  The sectors that are growing, like education and health care, are predominantly women's employment,  a spokeswoman for the Institute for Women's Policy Research tells the Journal.  Looking at the 21st century, it is really amazing how profound some of the [sex] segregation is in the labor market.  Economists also note that the gender gap in the workforce has been narrowing as women have started to get college degrees in larger numbers than men.

"(May 20, 2015  1:56 AM CDT) A more accurate name for the Cancer Fund of America would be the Reynolds Family Luxury Fund, according to federal investigators who say they've uncovered one of the biggest charity frauds on record. An FTC complaint says the fund and three related charities—the Breast Cancer Society, the Children's Cancer Fund of America, and Cancer Support Services—spent just 3% of donations on cancer patients and used much of the rest to pay for things like college tuition, consumer goods, luxury cruises, and even dating site memberships for family and friends, the Wall Street Journal reports. The organizations are accused of scamming donors out of $187 million between 2008 and 2012. The FTC complaint calls the organizations  sham charities  operated as  personal fiefdoms  by James T. Reynolds of Knoxville, Tenn., and his relatives, the Journal reports. Regulators from all 50 states joined the complaint.  Some charities use donations to send children with cancer to Disney World,  South Carolina's secretary of state tells the New York Times.  In this case, the Children's Cancer Fund of America used donations to send themselves to Disney World.  Two of the charities have already agreed to be dissolved, and the FTC says recovered funds will go to legitimate charities, though the chief of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection tells CNN that there's not much left and regulators will be lucky to recover $1 million.",Feds: Family Spent $187M Given to Cancer Charities,Feds: Family Spent $____M Given to Cancer Charities,187,Copy( 187 ),0

Montgomery County Police said Monday that a sixth body has been found in the debris of the Flower Branch apartments in Silver Spring, the AP reports. An explosion at the four-story building Wednesday night shook buildings more than a mile away. More than 30 people were injured, including three firefighters. Still, there was good news. Police said a 55-year-old man who had been unaccounted for, Oscar Ochoa, was located and is unharmed. That reduces the number of missing from eight to seven. Their ages range from three to 66. Police believe that the six bodies found correspond to those on the missing list, but the condition of the bodies has prevented authorities from making a positive identification thus far. Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the blast; some residents reported smelling gas before the explosion.

Taylor was convicted for a 1970 blaze that killed 28 people and destroyed a historic hotel in Tucson. The then-teenager was in the hotel, even though he wasn't a guest, and had a matchbook in his pocket. He told police during what he recalled as  very tough  interrogations that he'd seen someone else start the fire, CNN recounts. Taylor was sentenced to life in prison. But the judge has long expressed skepticism about the case, telling 60 Minutes recently that the evidence wasn't strong enough to convict—he's even sent Taylor Christmas gifts and law books, the AP reports. Forensic experts, meanwhile, have said that the original trial's experts  used methods no longer valid in the science of today  to declare the blaze as arson.  Today, all that media scrutiny finally resulted in action, as Taylor entered a plea of no contest, in a deal that will see him released from prison at last.",Man to Go Free 43 Years After Shaky Arson Conviction,Man to Go Free ____ Years After Shaky Arson Conviction,43,"Subtract( 2013 , 1970 )",1

It's another thing entirely to win a game you've never played before. Christian Pham of St. Paul, Minn., did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons. By accident. The 40-year-old professional poker player says he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold 'em but inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in.  It's a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies,  says a dealer. Essentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it's better if it's a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards. Pham says he didn't realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what.  At first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good,  says Chris Mecklin, who was sitting next to Pham when the newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn't know it would be a fortuitous one. Pham, who moved to the US from Vietnam 15 years ago, says the guidance from his fellow players at the table helped, and he studied up the night in between the two-day contest. In the end, he says it was his tournament acumen for when and how much to bet and manage his chips that got him to the top.

The Telegraph reports that middle school and high school teachers there have been issued a manual to use while teaching a new subject for 2015:  Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities.  The manual contains details of Kim Jong Un's childhood—specifically, the amazing story of how he was driving by age 3, per YTN TV. It also notes that Kim is an awesome artist, pens musical scores, and was acing yachting races before puberty.  At the age of 9, Kim Jong Un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company who was visiting North Korea at the time,  one of the passages reportedly reads (he won that race  despite the odds,  per Metro). This inherent ability to win at life apparently runs in the family: The Telegraph brings up old claims that were made about Kim's father. Kim Jong Il supposedly walked at 3 weeks of age, talked at 8 weeks, wrote six operas, and penned 1,500 books during his three-year college tenure (take that, L. Ron Hubbard). But a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University thinks the new curriculum is less about genealogical bragging rights and more about panicked propaganda.  Not many people in the North have respect for Mr. Kim, so children are being taught how great and powerful he is,  Toshimitsu Shigemura tells the Telegraph.

"(Oct 6, 2015  2:59 PM CDT) Six thousand federal inmates from around the country will be released from prison between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2, the Washington Post reports. It's the largest mass release of federal prisoners ever. The inmates are drug offenders whose sentences are being cut short based on a US Sentencing Commission decision last year. The commission reduced potential maximum punishments for drug offenders and made that decision retroactive. The releases announced Tuesday are just the first of what could be up to 46,000 drug offenders released early under the sentencing changes. The  overwhelming majority  of more than 80,000 public comments received by the commission supported the change. The Justice Department says approximately one-third of the 6,000 inmates being released are foreign citizens who will be deported, the Post reports. The rest will transition to halfway houses or house arrest then supervised release. Inmates must petition for early release, and judges will review their petitions on a case-by-case basis. So far, judges are granting about 70 early releases a week. Some of those being released early have been in prison for decades, but the average reduction is from a 10.5-year sentence to 8.5 years.

He'd been shot in the head. The 20-year-old was attending college on an electrician's scholarship and was just weeks shy of graduating, but he'd spent the past several months as a drug informant after police caught him selling a small amount of marijuana—$80 total. In a video of a meeting between Sadek and a narcotics detective, Sadek is encouraged to agree to make a handful of drug buys for police in exchange for avoiding felony charges, with the potential penalty being up to 40 years in prison and a $40,000 fine. Sadek agreed without consulting his parents or a lawyer, reports the Daily Beast. Now Sadek's parents are suing a task force deputy and the county for both failing to train their son and to  reasonably supervise  him.  The police just need to do their own job,  Tammy Sadek says.  They don't need to use our children to do their job.  She tells the Daily Beast that police framed her son's death as suicide. The family believes it was murder and connected to his informant work, noting Sadek's body was found wearing different clothes than he'd worn the day he disappeared and without a wallet.

There’re no words to describe it,  police chief Mike Siitari says.  This is a tough one to handle.  The bodies of two adults and three teenage children, all suffering from traumatic injuries, were found in various rooms throughout the house in the small town of Greenwood on Lake Minnetonka. Officers were checking on the family after they had not been seen at work or school in two days. Police are not currently releasing names, causes of death, or who they believe is responsible. But the Star Tribune identifies the family as Brian and Karen Short and their three children—a 17-year-old son and daughters ages 14 and 15.

The AP reports Brian Short founded AllNurses.com. His bio on the site states he lives outside Minneapolis with his wife and three children. According to the Star Tribune, officers found a small dog alive at the home before stumbling across the five bodies one at a time.

They found the air horn guy!  one local crowed online, per the Los Angeles Times, applauding a somewhat anticlimactic ending to the early-morning din that's been plaguing the city for six weeks. On its Facebook page, the El Segundo Police Department noted that at around 4am Sunday, officers heard an  extremely loud air-horn being actuated  and followed the sound to a 2006 Chevy Aveo driving around, which they pulled over. Inside: driver John Nuggent and air horn equipment, which Nuggent admitted to using to stir residents out of sleep. Several locals emerged from their homes and made a citizen's arrest against Nuggent—an important fact, the San Diego Union-Tribune notes, with police explaining that officers can't be victims of  disturbing the peace.  Had the residents not come out, the cops would only have been able to give Nuggent a slap on the wrist for a traffic infraction; now the charge gets prosecutable misdemeanor status, with a maximum of 90 days in jail, a $400 fine, or both if he's found guilty. Sgt. Vincent Martinez tells the Times the blare fest was apparently Nuggent's way of retaliating against someone in the area with whom he had a beef.  I've been an officer for over 27 years and I don't know if I've ever seen someone retaliate using an air horn,  Martinez says.  But people find very creative ways at getting at other people.

Observes Borzou Daragahi for the FT:  Despite seeking to distance itself from the international economy, the new currency's underpinnings may make ISIS's economy even more heavily dependent on global fluctuations than most, specifically on precious metal and commodity prices.

"(Nov 25, 2020  5:05 PM) People thinking of using a certain crockpot as a pressure cooker for Thanksgiving meals should set them aside immediately, the Consumer Product Safety Commission says. Sunbeam Products is recalling its Crock-Pot 6-Quart Express Crock Multi-Cookers because of a problem with the lid that has caused at least 99 injuries, including first-degree burns, CBS News reports. The CPSC says the device's lid doesn't always lock properly, which can  cause the lid to suddenly detach while the product is in use, posing burn risks to consumers from hot food and liquids ejected from the product.  The agency says consumers should contact Crock-Pot immediately to obtain a free replacement lid. More than 900,000 of the crockpots were sold in the US by retailers including Walmart, Target, and Amazon between July 2017 and this month, reports NBC Boston. Almost 30,000 were sold in Canada. The CPSC said the recall affects model SCCPPC600-V1, a number that's shown on a label on bottom of the unit. It says the cookers have date codes K196JN through K365JN and L001JN through L273JN, which appears on a prong of the electrical plug and the bottom of the base. The agency says consumers waiting for a new lid should  immediately stop using the recalled Crock-Pot in pressure cooker mode, but may continue to use for slow cooking and sautéing.",Recall Issued After Faulty Crockpots Burn 99 People,Recall Issued After Faulty Crockpots Burn ____ People,99,Copy( 99 ),0
"(Aug 24, 2011  11:04 AM CDT) Rick Perry holds one impressive record as Texas governor that even some of his competitors for the GOP's presidential nomination might not want—overseeing more executions than any governor in modern history, reports the Washington Post. With 234 people executed in Texas in Perry's 11 years as governor, Perry has overseen more deaths than the next two states combined (Oklahoma and Virginia) over the past 35 years.  If you don’t support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don’t come to Texas,  he wrote in his book Fed Up!. Some legal analysts say Perry is not responsible for that huge number of executions, as decisions to seek the death penalty are controlled by local prosecutors and the Texas governor has little room to interfere in the process.  So the short answer to why Texas has the most executions is (1) size, and (2) not being obstructed by hostile courts,  said the director of a pro-death-penalty group. But because Perry even vetoed a law to ban the execution of the mentally retarded, his critics say he is unusually enthusiastic about supporting the death penalty.",No. 1 Governor in Executions: Rick Perry,No. ____ Governor in Executions: Rick Perry,1,Copy( 1 ),0
"(Jan 30, 2017  10:03 AM) A state visit to Britain by President Trump later this year will go ahead, the prime minister's office said Monday, despite increasing calls for it to be canceled over his temporary ban on residents of seven majority-Muslim countries from traveling to the US, the AP reports. Furor over the travel ban has tarnished what British officials had considered a highly successful trip to Washington by Prime Minister Theresa May. She met Trump at the White House on Friday and announced he'd been invited to come to Britain later this year as Queen Elizabeth II's guest. Only hours after she'd left the White House, the president signed his executive order. May's Downing St. office said Monday  an invitation has been extended and accepted,  and the visit is still on. No date has been announced for the state visit, which involves lavish pomp and ceremony, generally with a stay at Buckingham Palace. Britain's three biggest opposition parties have called for the visit's cancellation, and an online petition opposing it currently has 1.3 million signatures. Per the Telegraph, it's now the second-most popular petition on the government's website, behind the 4 million people asking for a 2nd EU referendum. The petition argues  Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.  Any petition with more than 100,000 signatures must be considered for a debate in Parliament, though not a binding vote.

He died of bacterial pneumonia, and they were convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011. But despite the fact that the Schaibles' probation required them to seek medical attention if their remaining children became sick, they chose to treat a second sick child with nothing but prayer as well. The 8-month-old died on Thursday, after experiencing diarrhea and having trouble breathing, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. A judge yesterday said the pair—who belong to a fundamentalist church in Philadelphia that believes in faith healing— grossly and disastrously,  not to mention  knowingly, intentionally, hypocritically, and callously  violated that probation. They have not been charged, as authorities are waiting on autopsy results, but they could face a prison sentence as long as 10 years.

"(Oct 10, 2016  12:30 PM CDT) When CBS convened a panel to re-investigate the murder of JonBenet Ramsey 20 years after the fact, forensic pathologist Werner Spitz could not have been more clear in his assessment:  It's the boy who did it,  he said, referring to JonBenet's older brother, Burke. Now, Burke Ramsey has made good on a threat to sue for defamation, and he's going after Spitz for $150 million in damages, reports Courthouse News Service.  Spitz made this accusation without ever examining JonBenet's body, without viewing the crime scene, and without consulting with the pathologist who performed the autopsy on JonBenet,  says the complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit. Attorneys for the 29-year-old say they demanded a retraction but didn't get one, reports the AP. The lawsuit accuses Spitz of having a vendetta against the Ramseys  because he believes the Ramsey family shut him out of the investigation—thereby frustrating his pursuit of self-promotion.  It also says he  has a disturbing history of making false statements related to the brutal murder of young girls,  citing his testimony on other cases. Burke Ramsey recently appeared on the Dr. Phil show to maintain his innocence, a move he says he made solely because he was sure the CBS investigation would portray him as the killer.",JonBenet's Brother Files $150M Suit Against Pathologist,JonBenet's Brother Files $____M Suit Against Pathologist,150,Copy( 150 ),0

The actor who brought Tony Soprano to life on HBO for six seasons was in Sicily for a film festival, says the Hollywood Reporter. He won three Emmys as best actor in the role, but he also had a busy film career before and after the show. It ranges from 1993's True Romance (where he drew notice as a hitman) to more recent films such as Zero Dark Thirty.  Overweight, balding, with a thick New York accent, Gandolfini was the opposite of a marquee leading man and yet he proved through his masterful acting that he could make Tony Soprano sexy and smart,  writes Nellie Andreeva at Deadline.

We don't think it's much to break a glass ceiling for one woman and leave millions of women behind,  said the chair of the Feminist Majority, one of the groups that is supporting Obama.

The Hummus Bar in Kfar Vitkin is offering half-off hummus to tables of Jews and Arabs dining together, the Times of Israel reports.  With us we don't have Arabs! But we also don't have Jews … With us we've got human beings! Real excellent Arab hummus! Excellent Jewish falafel!  reads the eatery's Hebrew-language Facebook post from Oct.13, per Al Jazeera. Owner Kobi Tzafrir explains to the network that  we want to show that we're all human beings, just like each other, not so different.  The Times notes the kitchen is both kosher and halal, so there's no reason that Israelis and Palestinians can't break pita together. Quartz notes it's not the first time hummus has been offered in lieu of an olive branch between the Israelis and Palestinians: There's also been a selfies-with-hummus campaign and even a 2013 documentary called Make Hummus, Not War. Tzafrir says his offer has received a mostly positive response: He tells Al Jazeera that some Jew-Arab tables insist on paying full price to support his initiative, though there are the usual critics and wise guys in the Facebook comments section.

At 208 days, it has now bumped the Netherlands, which went 207 days in 1977, to No. 2 on the list. The lag is leading many Iraqis to question why they risked their lives to vote on March 7, notes the Washington Post, and has the US worried that the security gains Iraq fought so hard for could begin to erode.

There is no difference with the Iraqi case, except that the Netherlands had strong, functioning institutions and a caretaker government that continued to govern,  said a Dutch national and Iraq expert.  Iraq has very weak institutions and a caretaker government that can do very little. This makes for a potentially highly unstable and precarious situation.

"(Apr 8, 2015  2:15 PM CDT) An arrest has been made in the bizarre case of 300,000 chickens that were killed in South Carolina roughly two months ago. Former chicken farmer James Laverne Lowery, 44, was arrested at his Sumter County home last night and hit with second-degree burglary and malicious injury to personal property charges, reports WLTX. Two months ago, 16 commercial farms in Clarendon and Sumter counties saw their alarm systems cut and their temperature control systems manipulated to a point where some of the chickens housed inside either froze or overheated to death. At the time, authorities suspected the crime was committed by a disgruntled ex-employee of Pilgrim's Pride, which owned the birds. Pilgrim's laid off 60 employees in advance of the killings, and Lowery was one of them. Clarendon County deputies say he was let go for performance-related reasons.  He was a grower for Pilgrim's at one time,  says Major Kipp Coker, adding that Lowery may have been seeking revenge.  He hurt farmers in this county who work every day to feed their families that had no ax to grind with him, but yet he punished them as well,  says Sheriff Randy Garrett. Officials have pegged the cost of the crime to area farmers at $1.7 million. Lowery could also face federal charges—one count for each of the 16 farms he allegedly attacked—of tampering with the food chain, reports the State.

Thomas Ross—who filed a patent for his  Electronic Reading Device  in 1992—has filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming he has suffered  great and irreparable injury  and seeking a jury trial, the Daily Dot reports.

Now, People reports that Jane Doe No. 59 has been identified as Reet Jurvetson—born in Sweden, raised in Montreal, and just 19 when she died.

Police can't say whether Jurvetson is another Manson victim, but they're not ruling it out, either.

"(Apr 30, 2015  12:08 PM CDT) Need a push to start saving? You've got it, courtesy of the Employee Benefits Research Institute. A review of retirement surveys from 2010 to 2012 finds one in eight people who died at 85 or older were dead broke, with no assets to their name, reports NBC News. One in five had only a house as an asset, with average home equity of $140,000. Single? The news gets worse. One in six who died at 85 or older without a spouse were penniless. Some 10% were actually in debt, while 25% had $83,000 on average in home equity. But not all have the benefit of living to old age. About 30% of households that lost a family member between 50 and 64 left no financial assets and earned less income than older retirees.  A lot of folks really don't have much of a financial cushion by the time they get to the end,  says an economist, who previously found 46% of Americans die with less than $10,000 in assets. His findings suggest those who live longer die richer, perhaps because they didn't battle expensive, life-long health issues and therefore had money to spend on better health care. A shred of good news: Retirement account balances have hit record highs, according to an analysis from Fidelity Investments, per Time. The company says the average individual retirement account balance hit a record high of $94,100 in Q1 and the average Fidelity 401(k) balance is up 3.6% from 2014, though other reports are more discouraging.",One in 8 Older Americans Die Penniless,One in ____ Older Americans Die Penniless,8,Trans( eight ),1
"(Aug 27, 2011  6:18 AM CDT) Hundreds of militants crossed the Afghan border today and attacked three security checkpoints in northwestern Pakistan, killing 10 paramilitary soldiers and two policemen, officials said. It was the latest of a series of attacks that Pakistani officials say have been launched from an area of eastern Afghanistan where the US has largely pulled out its troops. The raids have increased tension between Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the US. The militants seized control of a local village after attacking the security checkpoints in Chitral district, says a local police official. Pakistani forces responded to the raid and killed nine insurgents, he said. But fighting was still ongoing this afternoon, and Pakistani troops requested helicopter gunships to drive the militants back across the border. Pakistan complained earlier this summer that militants coming from Nuristan and Kunar killed at least 55 members of the security forces and tribal police in a spate of attacks, and demanded that US and Afghan forces do more to stem the flow of fighters.",Afghan Militants Kill 12 in Pakistan,Afghan Militants Kill ____ in Pakistan,12,"Add( 10 , 2 )",1

A CDC report released Tuesday warns that hospitals in the Bay Area have recently treated at least seven patients who overdosed after taking what they thought was Norco, a medium-strength opioid painkiller. The pills actually contained fentanyl, a far more powerful drug that's 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the CDC. The Bay Area patients survived, but Sacramento County officials have reported 12 deaths linked to fake Norco in recent weeks, with another two fatal overdoses in neighboring Yolo County. Health officials obtained one of the fake pills from a Bay Area patient and discovered that it was an exact replica of a Norco pill, Medical Daily reports. Finding the source of the fakes  is our number one priority based out of San Francisco,  a DEA special agent in the city tells the AP.  We definitely want to connect the dots where we can.  The CDC report says fake medicine containing fentanyl is an  emerging and serious public health threat  and that it's vital for the general public to realize the  significant risks to life and health when purchasing what appears to be prescription medications from any source other than a reputable pharmacy or health care provider.

The big difference, as expected, is that Iraq is no longer on the banned list after promising to beef up screening, reports the AP. That leaves six Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The new directive, scheduled to take effect March 16, will prohibit new visas from being issued to travelers from those nations for 90 days, but those with current visas won't be affected. The revised order generally makes more exceptions than the first one, notes the Washington Post, including for those who are permanent legal residents of the US. President Trump signed it Monday, though not in a public ceremony as with the first.  If you have travel docs, if you actually have a visa, if you are a legal permanent resident, you are not covered under this particular executive action,  adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Monday, per CNN. The order also will suspend the nation's refugee program for 120 days, making exceptions for those already cleared, and it will cap the total number of refugees at 50,000 for fiscal 2017, down about half from last year. So will the narrower scope appease critics? Early reaction suggests not.

Michels, 64, was arrested Oct. 12 on desertion charges filed against him after he went missing from Minot Air Force Base near the Canadian border. Police say the former airman had taken the name Jeffrey Lantz, married, and had kids, per WFTV. In 1998,  Lantz  applied for a business license and started a construction company, Atlantic Development Corporation. Michels, originally from Ohio, was nabbed after the Facebook group Veteran Doe posted his photo in July, nearly 40 years to the day after he failed to report for duty. (That photo has since been taken down. The site calls  attention to the many missing veteran/active duty cases and unidentified person cases where there is a possible military connection.  The Air Force hasn't explained how Michels was found, per the Miami Herald. But Seminole County authorities identified him by a scar on his left leg near the ankle. There's no statute of limitations on desertion, so Michels will stand trial in a military court, per the IB Times. He was turned over to the custody of the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. Why Michels walked away from the remote base is unknown, but the Herald notes it's known for its nuclear missile silos and hard winters.

And with the Chinese beer market surging by 10% a year, expect Snow to grow even bigger. Though not as well known as Tsingtao, Snow has grown by buying up breweries all over China since it was formed in 1993 in a joint venture between SABMiller and China Resources. Last year, Snow sold 16.5 billion pints, about twice as much as former No. 1 seller Bud Light. Although very light and bland by the standards of most beer lovers in the West, Snow works well with the Chinese palate.  Chinese still see beer mostly as an accompaniment to a meal,  said the head of SABMiller in Asia.  Half of all beer is drunk in restaurants, and with spicy food, they want a less filling and less heavy beer.

This  inner GPS  helps explain how the brain creates  a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment,  the Nobel Assembly said. O'Keefe, of University College London, discovered the first component of this positioning system in 1971 when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room. Thirty-four years later, May-Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, identified another type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system for precise path-finding, the assembly said. It added that knowledge about the brain's positioning system may  help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss  that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.

Some 45% considered Romney's health care reform in Massachusetts a reason to oppose him, and 46% cited Paul's opposition to US military intervention overseas as a major negative. For Gingrich, his views on immigration and his marital history were seen as a negative by just 15% and 16%, respectively.

Then, in the fall of 2014, four days after the flag mystery was featured on the first episode of Brad Meltzer’s Lost History, a man who called himself Brian carried a flag in a plastic bag into a fire station in Everett, Wash., and told the firefighters he was a former Marine who'd been given the flag by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee, who'd been given it by a 9/11 widow.

"(May 12, 2020  7:36 AM CDT) Until this weekend, Wuhan hadn't had a new coronavirus case since early April. Now, with six new cases on the books, the Chinese city where the pandemic began is taking steps to prevent a new outbreak, starting with plans to test all 11 million of its residents. The BBC reports that, after more than two months under lockdown, the city started reopening on April 8 after it stopped seeing any new cases. Then, an elderly man was found Sunday to have the virus, followed by five others from the same housing complex. CNN notes none of those cases is believed to have come from outside the city. Now, per an internal document, each district in the city has been told to come up with its own plan by noon Tuesday for a  10-day battle,  in which it will need to test all residents in that time period. The document stresses that older residents and communities that are more crowded should get first priority. An assistant professor at Yale's School of Public Health tells the Global Times that such wide-scale testing is necessary to get a handle on transmission in China's densely packed cities. Some infectious disease experts think the mass testing is either unnecessary or undoable, either due to cost or logistics.

Plus, because between 3 million and 5 million residents have already been tested, the city would only need to test the 6 million to 8 million who hadn't been in 10 days—between 600,000 and 800,000 a day.

But what about the First Amendment? It's a little murky: The Supreme Court has previously ruled the government can't bar public speech due to profanity, but state law currently allows towns to enforce local laws that give police the power to arrest anyone who  addresses another person with profane or obscene language  in a public place, reports the AP.

"(May 8, 2014  1:03 AM CDT) Leo Sharp turned 90 yesterday ... while sitting in federal court in Detroit, where he was sentenced to three years in federal prison for his role in a drug smuggling operation. The Indiana man, a World War II veteran, was convicted of hauling cocaine between Mexico and Detroit for a Mexican drug cartel; he was arrested in 2011 near Ann Arbor, where he was found with almost $3 million worth of cocaine in his pickup during a traffic stop, the Detroit Free Press reports. In court yesterday, Sharp said he's  heartbroken  about his crime, and threatened suicide:  I won’t live in prison, I’m just going to end my life if I end up there.  His lawyer pleaded with the judge to reconsider the sentence, arguing that Sharp suffers from dementia and the condition caused him to use  bad judgment,  the AP reports. He also spoke at length about Sharp's military service, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star ( before we were even born, he was on top of mountains fighting Nazis,  the lawyer asserted). But the judge would not relent, noting that the dementia argument was an  insult to all the people who have dementia and don't get involved in illegal activity.  She added that she'd basically be sending a message to drug dealers that  if you want to inoculate your organization from punishment ... get an elderly person to do your deliveries for you.  Sharp, who the government says was paid more than $1 million by the cartel, agreed to pay the government $500,000 and give up property in Florida; his prison date has not yet been set.",90-Year-Old Drug Mule Handed Prison on Birthday,____-Year-Old Drug Mule Handed Prison on Birthday,90,Copy( 90 ),0

That makes him the oldest rider to even finish the race, the New York Times reports.  It's nothing,  says the Idaho native.  You just ride 650 miles on a death march.  That meant riding about 100 hours on 28 horses and outpacing 43 other competitors across rivers, dunes, wetland, valleys, and forested hills, often alone. It also meant training for months with previous race winners and preparing thoughtful touches, like taking blue ribbons to honor his horses, and baggies with two cigarettes and a pocketknife for herdsmen.  Preparation trumps youth,  says Long. But he was determined after seeing a documentary about the race, All the Wild Horses.  It took me about 15 minutes to decide that I could do that,  he says. An accomplished amateur rider, he endured a scary horse fall into a muddy trench and stayed sane on long stretches partly by singing  There's a Coach Comin' In  from the movie Paint Your Wagon (1969), he tells Forbes. He also enjoyed staying with locals at night in their tent-like homes, called gers. While others endured injuries including a punctured lung and a broken collarbone, Long kept on riding.

"(Apr 26, 2019  1:30 PM CDT) Four farmers in India only boast a few acres each, but a special potato they're growing has one of the world's biggest food and beverage conglomerates after them. PepsiCo's Indian subsidiary filed suits against the small group of farmers in early April, accusing them of planting a strain of potatoes patented for the company's Lay's potato chips, reports the Guardian. On Friday, the company offered to drop the complaints if the farmers played ball and joined thousands of other farmers in India who'd registered with the company's cultivation program, per CNN Business. That initiative provides seeds to farmers so they can grow potatoes for the potato chips.  Either join us or grow other potatoes,  a PepsiCo rep says the farmers were told in court. The suits are seeking close to $150,000 from each farmer. The Guardian notes that the lawsuits didn't go over well in India, where foreign companies swooping in to produce and sell food is a sore spot.  It's a question of India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty, and country sovereignty,  one activist says, adding that the suit was  spreading panic among the farmers.  A PepsiCo spokesperson said the legal action, a  last resort,  was necessary because the farmers being painted as rogues were hurting other farmers who were growing the same potatoes for the company. It's not the first time India has seen such a David-versus Goliath battle: CNN reports that small retailers there have also pushed back at giants like Walmart and Amazon infringing on their turf, getting restrictions passed in some cases.

"(Mar 18, 2016  10:41 AM CDT) Can't get that last bit of lip balm out of the tube? Scrape it out with your finger. That's basically what a federal appeals court told a California woman Thursday when it dismissed her class-action lawsuit alleging Fresh Inc. conned consumers into thinking there was more of its Sugar Lip Treatment in the tube than they could actually access, Courthouse News Service reports. The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit rejected Angela Ebner's claim that the company tried to mislead consumers about the quantity of its pricey lip balm, which sells for roughly $24 a tube, per the AP. Ebner had insisted that the way the company packaged and dispensed the lip treatment was in violation of her state's consumer protection laws, Reuters notes. To be more specific, Ebner said that the lip balm tube employs a twist-up mechanism that allows only 75% of the product to dispense beyond the tube opening. But the court noted that no state or federal laws were breached because the package labels accurately indicate just how much balm is in each tube. The court opinion stated, probably not to Ebner's liking, that  the reasonable consumer understands the general mechanics of these dispenser tubes  and that  it is up to the consumer to decide whether it is worth the effort to extract any remaining product with a finger or a small tool.

The operations were performed in early November on 130 patients who were all older than 50 and living in either Amritsar or nearby Gurdaspur, in Punjab state, an official says. Some of the patients reported this week that they'd lost their eyesight or were suffering infections. Doctors in Amritsar are treating some of the patients, but they say it's unlikely any will regain their sight. Police have launched an investigation and detained at least one doctor in Gurdaspur. Every year, thousands of people, especially in rural areas without proper health facilities, undergo cataract operations in medical camps held by health authorities and welfare groups. The case once again highlights the perilous state of health care in India, where hundreds of millions of poor people without access to doctors or health insurance are forced to seek treatment at medical camps because of poor services and corruption at government hospitals.

"(Feb 25, 2010  4:35 AM) When a NATO raid killed 10 children and teenagers at a remote mountain compound in Afghanistan last December, troops claimed to be targeting a  known insurgent group responsible for a series of violent attacks.  But after a lengthy investigation by the Times of London, NATO now admits that the boys killed—all of them between 12 and 18, eight of them members of the same family—were innocent civilians without connections to insurgent activity.  Knowing what we know now, it would probably not have been a justifiable attack,  a NATO official said. News of the deadly mistake comes amid growing anger over civilian casualties in Afghanistan and after a warning from US commander Stanley McChrystal that civilian deaths are putting NATO forces at risk of  strategic defeat.  But nobody appears ready to take blame for the botched raid: Western officials hint that Afghans pulled the triggers, while Afghan sources say US special forces were involved.",NATO Admits Killing 10 Afghan Kids in Botched Raid,NATO Admits Killing ____ Afghan Kids in Botched Raid,10,Copy( 10 ),0
"(Dec 18, 2018  7:10 AM) In what Mediaite says appears to be the first 2020 ad for President Trump's re-election campaign, supporters hear an unusual request. Campaign chief Brad Parscale asks them to call an 800 number and leave a personal message of thanks for the president.  We need to let President Trump know that we appreciate what he's doing for America,  Parscale says.  I need you to call the number on your screen and deliver a thank-you to President Trump.  You can see the ad via this tweet from journalist Yashar Ali, who spotted it on CNN Monday night.  President Trump has achieved more during his time in office than any president in history,  says Parscale. This being a campaign ad, another motive is at play: money. The Washington Post punched in the number and found that callers do indeed get a prompt to record their message. Then comes a plea for a donation, followed by a second one if callers disregard the first.  I understand a contribution is a lot to ask for, but President Trump is asking for your support now, before it's too late,  Parscale says.

And the stats don't get rosier from there: 38% said they had fallen asleep by accident during the day in the last month, and close to 5% nodded off while driving, reports the LA Times.  Sleep difficulties, some of which are preventable, are associated with chronic diseases, mental disorders, health-risk behaviors, limitations of daily functioning, injury and mortality,  says the report.  Drowsy driving, one of the most lethal consequences of inadequate sleep, has been responsible for an estimated 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the United States,  wrote the report. The survey also revealed that nearly half of Americans snore; that people who are unable to work are much more likely to get less than 7 hours of sleep compared to employed people; and people who are divorced or single tend to be slightly more likely to get less sleep than their married counterparts.

I wore a Speedo when I was in my 20s,  he says.  But come on. There should be a law prohibiting anyone over the age of 50 from wearing a Speedo.  He argues that the Long Island beach where he worked was using the rule to shed its older lifeguards—though 80% of them are over 40, he estimates.  They were just trying to get rid of the older guys.

Nearly 340 people were rescued from the rubble in Tainan, the city hit worst by the quake. About 2,000 firefighters and soldiers scrambled with ladders, cranes, and other equipment to the ruins of a 17-floor residential building that folded like an accordion onto its side, the AP reports. Local media said the building included a care center for newborns and mothers, and a newborn was among the dead in the disaster. Rescuers pulled out 248 survivors from the collapsed building. The quake came two days before the start of Lunar New Year celebrations that mark the most important family holiday in the Chinese calendar. The building had 256 registered residents, but far more people could have been inside when it fell because the population might have swelled ahead of the holiday, when families typically host guests. Taiwan's emergency management information center said 475 people were injured, with 368 of them discharged from hospitals by Saturday evening.

He died Tuesday morning after suffering a heart attack, his wife Nancy tells the AP. Though Lange had a successful career in radio, he is best known for his television role on the ABC game show, which debuted in 1965 and on which he appeared for more than a decade, charming audiences with his mellifluous voice and wide, easygoing grin. He also played host to many celebrity guests. Michael Jackson, Steve Martin, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, appeared as contestants. Even a pre-Charlie's Angels Farrah Fawcett appeared on the program, introduced as  an accomplished artist and sculptress  with a dream to open her own gallery. Lange was born on Aug. 15, 1932, in St. Paul, Minn., where at 15 he discovered a passion for local radio after winning an audition at a local station. He hosted that show for two years before attending the University of Minnesota and doing a three-year stint in the Marines. His big break on network TV came in 1962 when he was made an announcer and sidekick on The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show. After The Dating Game, he also hosted the game shows Hollywood Connection, $100,000 Name That Tune, and The New Newlywed Game. Lange also worked as a disc jockey for decades in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, and upon his retirement from broadcasting in 2005, he was the morning DJ for KABL-FM.

Lead Flight Director Milt Heflin picked up the phone and was given a warning by his flight dynamics officer: Air Force trackers who monitor orbital traffic had determined an inactive satellite from Turkey could potentially collide with the space shuttle Atlantis in just 15 minutes; the crew on board were asleep and couldn't be warned—based on their current positioning, they were about to enter a communications blackout period. As Eric Berger writes for Ars Technica, Heflin had no options and was  livid.  The Air Force generally gave 24 hours' notice in these cases, and if the satellite did indeed make contact, all lives could be lost. But there was that word Heflin missed, remember? Turkey. It was not a potential disaster but a Thanksgiving prank dreamed up by a couple of Heflin's flight controllers  during an otherwise boring overnight shift, during a fairly routine shuttle mission to deploy several Air Force payloads,  writes Berger. Heflin this month reflected on what happened next in a conversation with Berger. Knowing there was nothing he could do, he says he decided to use the bathroom. As he began to exit the room, one of the controllers urged him to look at the display that showed Atlantis' orbital track, saying the Turkish object has been included on it.  I don’t need to see the damn thing!  was his reply, and he left—without knowing that the  damn thing  was actually a turkey that had been coded to appear.

Carlo Goias was charged under New Jersey's strict gun law, which requires permits for firearms, including the airsoft gun Goias used while filming a car chase scene. Goias rejected a plea deal offer Tuesday that could have sent him to jail for less than a year. He faces up to a decade behind bars because of prior felony convictions that prosecutors say include theft and burglary.  I was shooting a movie—I wasn't committing a crime intentionally,  Goias says.  Robert De Niro doesn't ask Marty Scorsese if he has gun permits. We're actors. That's for the production company to worry about.  When he was arrested, Goias was playing the body guard of a drug dealer in the unfinished film Vendetta Games.

"(Jun 26, 2019  8:11 AM CDT) Two NOAA scientists were asked why the federal government waited 14 years to conduct a study of an oil spill that started in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. They didn't know, reports the Washington Post, but as the ones asked to do the study they could put a figure on what's still pouring out of the site all this time later: as many as 4,578 gallons daily. The oil platform was located in an underwater canyon some 12 miles from Louisiana and leased by the Taylor Energy Company—which claims just 3 gallons are seeping out daily. Monster waves churned up by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, triggered an undersea mudslide that took down the platform and more than two dozen well pipes, which were buried in more than 100 feet of sediment. Taylor Energy claims the oil is seeping out of the oil-soaked sediment. The report commissioned by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement found the oil is coming from a number of wells. The AP explains nine wells were capped by Taylor Energy, but the company has maintained it's more environmentally prudent to leave 16 of them buried than try to cap them. Gizmodo puts the new numbers in context, reporting they make for a cumulative spill of 25 million gallons; the Deepwater Horizon Spill was more than six times bigger, at 168 million gallons. The Weather Channel reports news of the former spill only publicly emerged in 2010, as scientists discovered it while looking into the latter spill; no coastal environmental damage has been reported.

"(Apr 20, 2015  8:58 AM CDT) The death knell of FM radio has sounded in Norway, but fortunately for listeners, that doesn't mean radio is going away. Instead, Norway is shifting to Digital Audio Broadcasting, a system already used by half the country, Ars Technica reports. The country is the world's first  to decide upon an analogue switch-off for all major radio channels,  as Radio.no puts it. The end of FM is due on a rolling basis in 2017.  This is an important day for everyone who loves radio,  says the head of NRK, the country's national broadcaster. The minister of culture agrees, per a government press release:  Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality.  DAB is currently home to 22 national Norwegian channels; FM has just five, Gizmodo reports. A poll finds that half of homes have a DAB-ready radio; however, some 7.9 million older radios will need to be upgraded, if not recycled, Ars Technica notes, pointing to an NBC News report on the  free, over-the-air digital service  that's usable via an attachment to a receiver. So is the US headed digital? Well, more Americans are listening to Internet radio all the time, Gizmodo notes, but at least as of 2012, more than 90% of Americans listen to AM/FM radio at least once weekly. Still, such digital shifts seem to be on the way for many countries, Maddie Stone writes. (As for AM radio, pot growers have reportedly caused some reception problems.)",Norway to Ditch FM Radio in 2017,Norway to Ditch FM Radio in ____,2017,Copy( 2017 ),0
"(Dec 11, 2018  3:08 PM) A shooting in the French city of Strasbourg killed at least three people and wounded 11 others near a world-famous Christmas market Tuesday, sparking a broad lockdown and a search for the suspected gunman, who remained at large, the AP reports. French prosecutors said a terrorism investigation was opened, though authorities did not announce a motive for the bloodshed. The city is home to the European Parliament, which was locked down after the shooting. It was unclear if the market—which was the nucleus of an al-Qaeda-linked plot in 2000—was targeted. The prefect of the Strasbourg region said the suspect was previously flagged as a possible extremist. The gunman has been identified and has a criminal record, according to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner; one official says he was wounded by soldiers guarding the market. Gendarmes went to the suspect's home to arrest him earlier Tuesday, before the attack, but he wasn't there, Morisse said. They found explosive materials, he said. French military spokesman Col. Patrik Steiger said the shooter did not aim for the soldiers patrolling in and around the Christmas market, but targeted civilians instead. Several of the people wounded were in critical condition, the interior minister said. President Emmanuel Macron adjourned a meeting at the presidential palace Tuesday night to monitor the emergency, his office said, indicating the gravity of the attack. In multiple neighborhoods of Strasbourg, the French Interior Ministry urged the public to remain indoors. Local authorities tweeted for the public to  avoid the area of the police station,  close to the city's well-known Christmas market, which is set up around the city's cathedral during the holiday season and is a popular gathering place.

In reality, he actually had spy connections, a Wall Street Journal investigation finds. It reveals that Heywood dished intel on the Bo family to MI6 in the year leading up to his murder. He apparently met an MI6 officer in 2009 and, after learning the person's true identity, acted as an unpaid informant. The revelation has implications for both the British and Chinese, in the Journal's view. It reframes the British government's reaction to his death: Officials didn't demand an autopsy or intervene in the quick cremation of his body, and didn't request that China investigate the death (initially blamed on  excessive alcohol consumption ) until three months had passed. And, if true, Chinese authorities would be  guilty  of a massive security breach should they have been unaware that MI6 had a source so close to a top party leader.

"(Apr 7, 2020  10:39 PM CDT) Grammy-winning singer-songwriter John Prine died Tuesday of COVID-19 complications, his family says. The 73-year-old folk-country artist was admired by such big-name colleagues as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and, as Rolling Stone reports, he helped shape the Americana genre, whose current stars Jason Isbell and Brandi Carlile, among others, were also fans of his. Born in a Chicago suburb to the president of the local steelworkers' union and raised on the stars of the Grand Ole Opry, Prine started writing songs at a young age. After high school, he became a postal worker, an era during which he wrote many of his  classics,  per Rolling Stone. He was drafted into the army during the Vietnam War, though he ended up in Germany instead. Upon his return home, Roger Ebert discovered him performing at a Chicago club's open mic night. After Ebert's glowing review of that 1970 performance (which you can read in full here), Prine started selling out shows, including one attended by Kris Kristofferson and Paul Anka. They, too, were impressed, which ultimately led to Prine's deal with Atlantic Records. His self-titled debut album was released in 1971. Rolling Stone says he spent much of his career  underground,  with his songs covered and sung by such luminaries as Bonnie Raitt, Johnny Cash, George Strait, the Everly Brothers, Joan Baez, Carly Simon, and Bette Midler—but his 2018 album, his first one in 13 years featuring original material, was the highest debut of his career and led to some of the biggest shows he'd ever done (and that was after he beat cancer twice). Of his music, the New York Times says he  chronicled the human condition in song,  telling stories including those of of a drug-addicted war veteran, a lonely elderly couple, and a middle-aged woman stuck in a bad marriage.

Mickelson was not in the field at the AT&T Byron Nelson tournament in Irving, Texas, where play began Thursday morning. Walters, meanwhile, was arrested in Las Vegas Wednesday and charged with insider trading; he's set to appear in court Thursday.

"(May 14, 2017  3:34 PM CDT) When Charles Shaw wines first debuted at Trader Joe's in 2002, they lived up to the name  Two Buck Chuck,  costing just $1.99 a bottle. And yes, plenty of critics call the wine undrinkable and worse, even accusing parent company Bronco Wine of not removing such harvest debris as dead birds, insects, and rodents from its crops of grapes. But far more people like it enough to buy it, with more than 800 million bottles sold since then. So Business Insider set out to calculate just how the wine can be produced so cheaply, and a lot of it comes down to simple location and sheer volume. Bronco Wine may be  bottled in Napa Valley,  per its label, but the grapes are grown in a far less prestigious and ideal area: California's hot Central Valley. This means grapes grow in great abundance, with huge harvests, but the heat scorches quality. Bronco also ferments the wines in oak chips instead of barrels, uses a cheap form of natural cork for its corks, and ships in lighter bottles and cheaper brown boxes. The wines are even described as being  freeway aged,  meaning they only age on the truck ride to the bottling facility in Napa, per Marketplace. Volume helps, too, with 90 million gallons of wine produced a year. Like the price but not the product? Trader Joe's is introducing $1 cans of wine from an Italian supplier that Delish reports  sound amazing.

"(Mar 24, 2015  1:45 AM CDT) The first of 100 wood bison aimed at re-establishing a species that went extinct more than a century ago in Alaska were flown to a rural village over the weekend ahead of a return to the wild. The 30 juveniles were loaded into specially designed  bison boxes  and trucked from the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in Portage to Anchorage before being flown to Shageluk, about an hour away. In several weeks, after 70 more wood bison reach Shageluk, and after they've become acclimated, they will be released as a group into the Inoko Flats, one of the areas of Alaska where wood bison once roamed. The group will include 25 pregnant females; wood bison tend to establish a connection to places where they give birth, a biologist says. The director of the conservation center says restoring an animal to its native habitat is an opportunity that doesn't come often.  It's such an opportunity to go back in time and right a wrong. We as people never get a chance to do that, but in this case, they did. And today's the day we correct that mistake,  he says. Wood bison are native to Alaska and Canada. They're North America's largest land mammal and are bigger than the plains bison found in the Lower 48. The herd will be closely monitored for the first couple of years, authorities say, and hunting may resume when the herd reaches 300 or 400 animals.","After 100 Years, Bison Back in Alaska","After ____ Years, Bison Back in Alaska",100,Copy( 100 ),0

Victoria state County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd sentenced the 77-year-old to six years in prison for abusing two 13-year-old choirboys in 1996, NPR reports.  I am conscious that the term of imprisonment ... carries with it a real, as distinct from theoretical, possibility that you may not live to be released from prison,  he told Pell, who will be eligible for parole in three years and eight months. The former Vatican treasurer was once the church's No. 3 official. One of the two victims, identified in court as  J,  said that while he is glad Pell is going to prison,  everything is overshadowed  by the appeal, which will be heard in June. The second victim,  R,  died of a heroin overdose in 2014 and his family didn't learn of the abuse until after his death. Lawyer Lisa Flynn said R's father is glad there has been a conviction, but he believes the abuse destroyed his son's life and is saddened by a sentence he feels is too short, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

That's if we don't change our greenhouse-gas-emitting ways, scientists say: A study co-author says the chance of a megadrought in the central and western US sometime this century is more than 80%, the AP reports. A megadrought is one lasting at least 35 years. The data shows  more convincingly than ever before that unchecked climate change will drive unprecedented drying across much of the United States—even eclipsing the huge megadroughts of medieval times,  an outside expert tells the Smithsonian. The Southwest has an 80% risk of megadrought at the current rate of emissions, but even if we drop to  moderate  emissions, the risk remains high, the Smithsonian reports. Scientists turned to more than a dozen different climate models to examine the future; as for the past, they got information from tree rings, which show how wet each year was.  There are degrees of screwed, and this paper suggests we’re falling off the cliff,  another expert tells Slate. Still, we have  ample warning  to make changes, a researcher tells the Smithsonian.

The poll found that only 17% of Americans expect to know the winner Tuesday night, while 18% expect to know the following day, 30% expect to know within a week, and 3% believe it will be a month before the winner is determined. The poll found only minor variations between different groups: The people most optimistic about getting a result Tuesday night are Republican men—23% of them believe a winner will be confirmed then. The poll also found high levels of distrust of the electoral system among supporters of both parties, with 34% of Democrats and 30% of Republicans expressing a lack of faith in the system's integrity. With a rise in mail-in voting and a close vote expected in swing states that don't start counting ballots until polls close, including Pennsylvania, analysts say it could be days before a winner is confirmed unless either President Trump or Joe Biden has a much better night than polls predict.

Per Krebs on Security, the FBI has been on the receiving end of  unspecified reporting  suggesting cybercriminals are preparing to carry out a so-called cash-out, in which they hack a bank or payment card processor—often gaining entry by successfully phishing an employee at the institution—and then visit ATMs armed with cloned cards and begin pulling out money, as much as millions over the course of a few hours. The alert made to banks on Friday indicated the scheme would take place in the coming days, with Krebs reporting such attacks typically occur after close-of-business on Saturdays. Krebs delves more into the process, which typically involves loosening fraud controls—like doing away with the cap on the amount of cash that one can withdraw in an ATM transaction—and jacking up account balances so there's more cash to take. The alert explained  historic compromises have included small-to-medium size financial institutions, likely due to less robust implementation of cyber security controls,  and Krebs backs that up by recalling an alleged cash-out scheme that occurred at the National Bank of Blacksburg in Virginia that saw $2.4 million taken over two cash-outs in May 2016 and January 2017.

TMZ has video of the  bizarre naked struggle  Monday night between 22-year-old Buffalo Bills receiver Zay Jones and his older brother, 25-year-old Cayleb Jones, a receiver for the Minnesota Vikings. The skirmish went down in a Los Angeles apartment building, where the party who was naked—Zay Jones—can be heard in the video yelling,  I'm going to fight for Jesus  before briefly scuffling with Cayleb in a hallway, then running out of the frame as a woman in the background screams; TMZ identifies her as Cayleb's girlfriend and says it was her apartment they were near.

Now, the battle is over, and Hermine Ricketts and husband Tom Carroll won, CBS Miami reports. They had been growing vegetables in their front yard for more than two decades, per the Miami Herald, when they were told in 2013 by code enforcement officers that Miami Shores bans such a practice. They dug up the garden, and have been fighting the law ever since. First, the Institute for Justice filed a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the ban on front yard gardens is an unconstitutional violation of property rights, but a court ruled in favor of the village, an appeals court upheld the ruling, and the state Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Then their attorney decided to take a different route. They went to the state legislature, and this year, a bill passed both chambers, was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis, and took effect July 1. It states that any local ordinance that expressly limits or prohibits growing vegetables on a person's property is  void and unenforceable.  To celebrate the law taking effect Monday, the couple replanted their vegetable garden, which can't grow in the backyard due to insufficient sunlight.

"(Jan 16, 2014  2:30 PM) State wildlife officials are trying to figure out why all the fish have died in a northern Nevada marina where the stocked fishery has flourished since the man-made lake was created nearly 15 years ago. An estimated 100,000 trout, bass, and catfish have died over the past month in the Sparks Marina along US Interstate 80 east of Reno, apparently the result of a dramatic, unexplained drop in dissolved oxygen levels, says state Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris Healy. And that's  probably a pretty conservative guess,  says Healy, who estimates they've stocked close to 1 million adult fish in the lake since 1998. Scientists say a bitter cold snap could have caused oxygen-poor waters to rise from the old rock quarry's bottom to the surface, but they don't understand what sparked the massive die-off. Fish biologists confirmed that low oxygen levels caused the death of an estimated 3,000 fish in one corner of the lake in mid-December, but they thought at the time that the event was localized and of limited impact.

The Washington State Patrol says 47-year-old father Corey Simmons died Friday evening after his Nissan Sentra came off the winding Whidbey Island road and fell more than 100 feet into a ravine, hitting trees on the way down, KING5 reports. His twin daughters, Rosaline and Aurora, escaped through the vehicle's broken back window and went for help after checking on their father, police say. After they made it back to the roadway, they were helped by a Good Samaritan who spotted the girls as she drove past. Rosaline and Aurora were hospitalized with minor injuries after the driver called 911. Police say their father wasn't wearing a seat belt, but the girls were strapped into their booster seats when the vehicle came off the road. Police say the crashed vehicle was not visible from the road.  It’s one of the truly saddest stories, but so heroic at the exact same time.

Instead, write out  2020  in its entirety. Why? Writing  1/3/20  or something like that makes it easy for someone to doctor the document by sticking a few numbers onto the end.

"(Jun 16, 2015  9:48 AM CDT) The Obama administration is cracking down on artificial trans fats, calling them a threat to public health. The FDA said today it will require food companies to phase out the use of artificial trans fats almost entirely. Consumers aren't likely to notice much of a difference, but the administration says the move will reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year. The FDA made a preliminary determination in 2013 that trans fats no longer fall in the agency's  generally recognized as safe  category, and made that decision final today, giving food companies three years to phase them out. With trans fats off the list, any company that wants to use them will have to petition the FDA, which is unlikely to allow many uses. Once a staple of the American diet—think shortening and microwave popcorn—most trans fats are already gone. The FDA says between 2003 and 2012, consumer trans-fat consumption decreased about 78% as food companies used other kinds of oils. Still, the FDA says those trans fats still in the food supply are a public health concern. Scientists say there are no health benefits to trans fats, created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid (they're often called partially hydrogenated oils). Trans fats are used in processing food and in restaurants, usually to improve texture, shelf life, or flavor, but they can raise levels of  bad  cholesterol and lower  good  cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. The FDA hasn't targeted small amounts of trans fats that occur naturally in some meat and dairy products because they'd be too difficult to remove.

On a shelf in a hut in Cape Adare sat a  perfectly preserved  fruitcake apparently untouched for more than a century, reports Stuff.co.nz. Made by British label Huntley & Palmers, the fruitcake was hidden inside a  severely corroded  tin taken from the hut as part of a conservation project encompassing several old huts built during a Norwegian expedition in 1899, per AAP. And though its paper had begun to deteriorate, the cake itself looked  like new  and rather tasty. Unfortunately, it didn't smell quite as good, with an odor of  rancid butter,  Lizzie Meek of New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust tells Newshub. The fruitcake was actually one of 1,500 artifacts recovered from the huts. And it wasn't the only food item. There were also  badly deteriorated  meat and fish, sardines, and  rather nice looking  jams, in addition to tools and clothing, Meek says. The fruitcake, however—believed to have been carried to Cape Adare by a member of Robert Falcon Scott's British Antarctic Expedition in 1911—was  quite a surprise,  Meek says.  Most people don't carry a whole fruitcake to Antarctica and not eat it.

Researchers say that around 1.7% of men and women aged 14 to 39 have chlamydia, which adds up to 1.8 million cases nationwide, but only 1.4 million cases have been reported, leaving around 400,000 undiagnosed cases of the sexually transmitted disease, reports WebMD. The disease can do serious damage to women's reproductive systems but is often symptomless, Fox notes.  Young women continue to bear a disproportionate burden,  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers say in a press release, explaining that there is a chlamydia prevalence of 6.4% among sexually active adolescent girls aged between 14 and 19—but with a major racial disparity. The rate is 18.6% among black teenage girls, compared to 3.2% among white girls. The researcher says the study shows the need for regular screening of sexually active teen girls, with targeted intervention for those most at risk.","400K Americans Have Chlamydia, Don't Know It","____K Americans Have Chlamydia, Don't Know It",400,"Paraphrase( 400,000 , K )",1

NATO said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device but provided no further details about the attack and did not identify the dead service members. The statement said NATO's policy is to allow  national authorities  to give details about the soldiers. A surge in Afghan and coalition forces during the past two years routed Taliban fighters from many of their strongholds in the south, but the insurgents have stepped up their attacks this summer to take back key areas. The service members' deaths were the latest today caused by bombs planted by insurgents along roadsides, paths or mountain tracks.

The collision involving a Metro-North Railroad train and a Jeep Cherokee in Valhalla, about 20 miles north of New York City, sent hundreds of passengers scrambling to get to safety. Authorities say the impact was so forceful the electrified third rail came up and pierced the train. Killed were the SUV's driver and five people aboard the train, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says. The toll was initially reported to be seven; officials revised it to six this morning, reports the Journal News. Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino says the front part of the train was  completely charred and burned.   I am amazed anyone got off that train alive,  he says. Authorities say the SUV's driver had gotten out of her vehicle momentarily after the crossing's safety gates came down around her. She then got back in and was trying to drive forward when she was hit. The train shoved the SUV about 10 train-car lengths.

The AP reports that Adolfo Martinez, 30, was convicted last month, and Wednesday he was sentenced to at least 15 years behind bars for an arson hate crime, with an additional 30 days tacked on for harassment, per Story County records. The June 11 incident took place after Martinez got kicked out of the Dangerous Curves strip club in Ames and threatened to come back and burn the bar down, per an Ames Police Department spokesman. Police were called to the scene shortly after midnight, which is when they found, burning in the street outside the bar, a car tire and a gay pride banner Martinez had ripped off the front of the Ames United Church of Christ, reported KCCI at the time. The flag featured a rainbow design and read  God is still speaking.   We believe God is still speaking to us through the Bible and through each other ... and because of that we've been able to get to a place where we can affirm all of God's children, including queer people,  said the Rev. Eileen Gebbie, a church minister who herself is gay. Martinez told KCCI in June that he was  guilty as charged  and that it was his  honor  to burn the flag.  It is a judgment and it's written to execute vengeance on the heathen,  he said. The judge was all for the maximum sentence, as Martinez has a history of harassment.  Nobody got shot [and] nobody was sexually assaulted,  says Gebbie, who tells KCCI her church offered money to help with Martinez's legal bills and to take care of his three kids.  It was a banner.

Johann Breyer, a native of the former Czechoslovakia, was arrested yesterday at his home by federal authorities and now faces an extradition hearing. German prosecutors say he worked as a guard at Auschwitz and Buchenwald—and more specifically that he worked in the Birkenau section of Auschwitz where prisoners were killed in gas chambers. He immigrated to the US in 1952 and worked as a tool-maker. The New York Times says this could be the  last Nazi case on American soil,  and both the Times and the Inquirer describe Breyer as appearing confused at times during his initial hearing. Breyer faces 158 counts of aiding and abetting the Nazis, one for each trainload of prisoners killed at Auschwitz between May and October of 1944, reports AP.

That's because their coastal village, located some 480 miles west of Anchorage, is in the process of being washed into the Bering Sea. As the Guardian explains in an in-depth look at the town, the Ninglick River flows past three of Newtok's sides on its path to the sea, and it's been chipping away at the village at a rate that's only grown more aggressive due to climate change (more than 100 feet of shoreline gone some years), which has been linked to melting permafrost and dwindling protective sea ice. The US Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the village, and offered no break to the gloom: It concluded that seawalls or other protective measures wouldn't work, and that Newtok's highest point could be underwater in just four years, by 2017. The villagers must leave (a tribal administrator tells Alaska Public Radio relocation has been a major town talking point for the last three decades), leading the Guardian to dub them  America's first climate change refugees.  The villagers selected a new site nine miles away, but moving the town there could cost $130 million, and relocation efforts have yet to truly get off the ground.

Turns out it didn't save taxpayers any money, didn't affect the number of applications, and didn't even ferret out very many drug users, the New York Times reports. During the four months the tests were given, just 2.6% of applicants failed, mostly for marijuana use. Everyone who passed was reimbursed for the cost of the test—which totaled $118,140, or more than the state would have paid in benefits to those who failed, according to an ACLU director. That means the program actually cost the government $45,780. The tests were only given from July through October; at that point, following an ACLU lawsuit against the state, a judge issued a temporary injunction halting the tests. The recently released state data comes on the heels of Georgia installing a practically identical law and other states considering doing the same. Of course, supporters of the Florida law still back it, and some insist that the law will deter drug users who would normally apply for assistance.

Today, in a sign of just how fast the crisis is escalating, it made a formal request to Congress for nearly twice that amount, reports the Washington Post. The $3.7 billion would be divvied up among various agencies with a two-pronged goal: to speed up the deportation process while making sure that the kids get adequate health care in detention centers in the interim.

Police say remains found in a remote part of rural Pima County weeks ago have been identified as those of Isabel Mercedes Celis, the New York Daily News reports.  Obviously this is not the ending that any of us had hoped for, but this is also not the ending of the case,  Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said Friday.

Magnus did not disclose the cause of death or how long the remains had been in that location, but said they weren't found by accident, Tucson News Now reports.  It was not a happenstance,  the chief said. The Celis family issued a statement thanking the community for its support over the years.  Now is our time to mourn,  the statement said.  We ask for our privacy during this time so that we can do that.  After Isabel disappeared from her Tucson home overnight on April 20, 2012, police followed up more than 2,200 leads without success.

Shirley Niemiec says she has no choice but to call firefighters daily to help her husband George get out of bed. The fire chief estimated that each visit cost about $65, WTKR reports. But the firefighters union puts that total much higher: between $250,000 and half a million dollars, according to WTVR.

She said they thought they found a solution when they bought a lift to help George get out of bed. But, she said,  I thought I could do it myself but I couldn't.  So she started dialing up the fire station 1.8 miles from her house.

The Vanzolini bald-faced saki, a distinctive  flying monkey  that sports shaggy hair with golden highlights around its arms and legs, hadn't been seen since 1936, when it was spotted in an isolated part of the Brazilian Amazon along the border of Peru. (Dead specimens were collected 20 years later in another expedition, notes Gizmodo.) Led by Global Conservation Institute Director Laura Marsh, a team set out to find the elusive primate on a four-month expedition of the Eiru River in a cramped, two-story houseboat. Just four days into the journey, Marsh says she saw three Vanzolini saki high in the trees and immediately burst into tears.  It was fantastic,  she tells National Geographic.  I was trembling and so excited I could barely take a picture.  A journalist accompanying the team documented the highs and lows of the research trip in a stunning bioGraphic photo essay. She noted that during the expedition, the team learned that a graduate student doing field research nearby obtained a skull and skins from a hunter and, scooping the very title the team had hoped to use, published a paper titled  Rediscovery of Vanzolini’s Bald-Faced Saki.  But the team continued its research and plans to publish its findings in the journal Oryx later this month.

The last thing we wanted to do was put these animals down,  says Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple.  But it wasn't a safe scene.  Three men hired by the farm opened fire on the animals this afternoon in woods in the town of Coeymans, about 10 miles south of the capital. Bethlehem police Lt. Thomas Heffernan said the decision was made after experts agreed tranquilizers would not be effective and no portable corrals or trailers could hold the animals. They escaped yesterday from a farm across the Hudson River in the Rensselaer County town of Schodack. The owner believes they swam across the river to the town of Bethlehem, where they wandered across a busy stretch of Interstate 87 and into neighboring Coeymans. The killing of the buffaloes, which were confined in the stream bed, turned chaotic at the start, with deputies detaining one of the shooters who refused their order to finish off one of the three buffaloes that were initially shot. Apple said the wounded animal was floundering in the water.  We wanted that animal down,  he said, and the man continued instead to shoot blindly into the brush at the other retreating buffaloes.

Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke announced Monday that the status will be lifted July 22, 2019, giving around 60,000 people 18 months to get their affairs in order and leave the country in an  orderly transition.

Significant steps have been taken to improve the stability and quality of life for Haitian citizens.  Lawmakers from both parties, however—especially in Florida, home to more than half the affected TPS holders—had argued against lifting the designation, saying Haiti is in no shape to accept 60,000 new arrivals and that the move would deprive the US construction industry of badly needed workers, the Washington Post reports.

"(Dec 16, 2015  5:45 PM) Listeners in Chile got a major shock last week when a 62-year-old bus driver named Guillermo Reyes called into a popular radio program to talk about his love life and ended up confessing to at least 18 murders, the Daily Beast reports. Reyes, going by the fake name  Alberto,  told the host of Chacotero Sentimental he shot multiple people and then disposed of the bodies while serving as a soldier in General Augusto Pinochet's army.  We blew them up,  Reuters quotes Reyes.  They fell apart. Nothing was left of them. Not even their shadow.  Over the 17 years of Pinochet's rule, at least 3,200 civilians were killed. A thousand bodies still have yet to be found, the Guardian reports. An expert tells the Daily Beast that Reyes' interview is the first time dynamite has been mentioned as a method for  disappearing  Pinochet's enemies. Reyes, who didn't appear to have any remorse for the killings, said he was conscripted into the Pinochet army young and then indoctrinated, the Guardian reports.  The first time [I killed someone] I cried,  he said.  The second time I liked it.  He defended his actions, saying soldiers who didn't follow orders were executed.  Let’s get back to the Italian,  the Daily Beast quotes Reyes, who repeatedly tried to return to the topic of an Italian woman he had slept with. The Guardian reports police traced the call and arrested Reyes Friday. He's now been charged with the murders of two men, members of Chile's socialist party who were arrested and held as political prisoners after Pinochet overthrew President Salvador Allende, in 1973. Their bodies have never been found.

It's the first clinical proof that a man's age has a direct effect on a couple's fertility.  Even more surprising, the proportion of miscarriages went up as well,  said a lead researcher.

But after his family called the fire department on March 30, they never saw their son alive again. He was admitted to the ICU of a nearby hospital and put on a ventilator, and was unconscious when a nurse FaceTimed his family so they could talk to him as visitors were not allowed. Late the next night, he was gone. His kidneys and heart had failed.  Our son is proof positive that it can take the life of a young person,  his mom says.

Riley, whose lungs collapsed after a severe case of pneumonia last fall, died on Saturday, KSL reports. He had just turned 20 last week, per the Salt Lake Tribune. A few weeks ago, he underwent transplant surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, which agreed to treat him after his parents searched the country for a willing hospital. His parents say that after being drug-free for around a year, he smoked pot on Thanksgiving, days before becoming ill, which was enough to get him kicked off the transplant list in Utah, BuzzFeed reports. Riley's family says he died of complications from the surgery.  We know that in our hearts we gave him every opportunity to survive,  the family said on a YouCaring page.  He will live in our hearts forever. Riley is now free to climb every mountain ... and run every river [and] ... will continue to do so with his family in spirit.  In an earlier statement, the Utah hospital said it does not transplant organs in  patients with active alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use or dependencies until these issues are addressed.  BuzzFeed notes that, in a sad irony, the Pennyslvania doctors treated Riley with Marinol, an FDA-approved synthetic version of the marijuana ingredient THC, to stimulate his appetite after his weight dropped to 97 pounds.

"(Dec 20, 2018  9:40 AM) The Catholic Church in Illinois withheld the names of at least 500 priests accused of sexually abusing children, while nearly 75% of allegations were either not investigated or investigated but not substantiated, according to a scathing report from the state's attorney general. Claims involving just one victim were often found to be not credible, even when the victim was believable, while claims against deceased and reassigned priests, and those in a religious order (like the Jesuits), weren't investigated at all, AG Lisa Madigan writes in the nine-page preliminary report out Wednesday, based on files turned over by Illinois' six dioceses, per CNN. The report doesn't name priests or officials suspected of negligence, but it concludes the dioceses of Chicago, Belleville, Joliet, Peoria, Rockford, and Springfield are  incapable of investigating themselves,  as the New York Times puts it. They  will not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own,  having previously discredited claims by  focusing on the survivors' personal lives,  reads the report. It reveals a  shocking  number of hidden names, Madigan tells the Times. She leaves her post in January with a promise from her successor to keep up the investigation launched in August. Only 185 of 690 accused priests were publicly identified by the church as facing credible allegations.  I want to express again the profound regret of the whole church for our failures to address the scourge of clerical sexual abuse,  says Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago and an ally of Pope Francis.  It is the courage of victim-survivors that has shed purifying light on this dark chapter in church history.

Women will be  made available  to these 15 men, even if they are married to someone else, notes the Daily Mail.

Ruth Ann Steinhagen, whose story inspired the Robert Redford movie The Natural, was 83 when she died Dec. 29 of a subdural hematoma that arose after a fall in her home, reports the Chicago Tribune. The paper talks to the biographer of the Philadelphia Phillies' Eddie Waitkus, who explains the depth of her obsession: In 1949, at age 19, she was in a Chicago hotel where Waitkus was staying. She managed to slip him a note telling him she had  something of importance to speak to you about,  and he visited her room. When he sat down, she told him she had a surprise for him; she took a rifle from the closet and shot him in the chest, then held his hand, the AP reports.

Now Adam is suing the Washington DC university, where he just finished his junior year, USA Today reports. Adam Semprevivo's lawyer tells the Daily Beast Georgetown notified the rising senior on Wednesday that he would be expelled. Per the lawsuit, the university is also considering nullifying his earned academic credits. The suit says doing so would deprive Semprevivo of due process and violate 10 of the procedures outlined in Georgetown's honor system, including appointing an investigations officer, making a written report on the alleged violation, organizing a hearing board, and allowing the student the right to appeal evidence.

But Mitoshi Matsumoto says the company is trying to change that description to Japan's best-known former 7-Eleven franchisee. The convenience store owner and the company have been engaged in a battle over its round-the-clock demands: Last month, Matsumoto said he would close the store—open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, per company policy—for New Year's Day only, so that he and his two full-time workers could break from their normal schedule of 14-hour shifts. He'd already irked the company in February by deciding to trim his store hours and close between 1am and 6am daily. 7-Eleven threatened to close the store then but backed off after he attracted media attention. Matsumoto says retaliation took the form of a letter sent to him 10 days ago that said 7-Eleven had logged 78 complaints in 2019 about his store, and that the location would be closed if he didn't rectify the situation by year-end. The Japan Times reports negotiations failed on Sunday and 7-Eleven canceled his contract, but that Matsumoto still plans to close Wednesday and reopen Thursday—though his cash register won't work and he won't be able to restock inventory. He says he may sue to remain open. The Times notes 7-Eleven is controlled by a Japanese company and that 40% of the convenience stores in the country are 7-Eleven. More fascinating, it writes that Japan views these stores as an element of its  infrastructure, like highways and sewers.

He was 90. Pell sponsored legislation creating the Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, which passed in 1972 and provided direct aid to college students. The awards were renamed  Pell Grants  in 1980. By the time Pell retired, the grants had aided more than 54 million low- and middle-income Americans.  Any student who has ever received federal aid has Senator Pell to thank for his or her education,  said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Pell was first elected to the Senate in 1960.

Maribel Martinez says she was supposed to meet her son, Andy, at New York's JFK Airport after his flight from the Dominican Republic—where he'd been staying with relatives—on Aug. 17, but was instead presented with another boy carrying Andy's passport.  I was freaking out,  Martinez, who says she paid a $100 fee to have a JetBlue representative take Andy to his plane, tells the New York Daily News.  I thought he was kidnapped. I thought I would never see him again.  Three hours later, Martinez learned there had been a switcheroo. Both boys were flying out of the Dominican Republic when the mixup occurred. JetBlue says it's investigating what happened, per NBC News, adding that it  immediately took steps to assist the children in reaching their correct destinations.  The statement notes that  while the children were always under the care and supervision of JetBlue crew members, we realize this situation was distressing for their families.  Distressing is an understatement, says Martinez, who's suing JetBlue for negligence.  I still haven't stopped crying,  she says.

An 18-year-old man says West hit him, but a source insists the alleged victim actually sparked the incident. The details: Kim Kardashian was dogged by the paparazzi as she headed into a meeting at which West had already arrived.

Amina Al-Jeffery grew up in Wales and has dual British and Saudi Arabian citizenship, and says her father Mohammed Al-Jeffery, a 60-something academic, took her to Saudi Arabia four years ago, where he has kept her imprisoned and physically abused her, the Independent reports. Lawyers representing her are now in London asking a court to help her. It's not clear how they learned of her, though the BBC reports that she alerted the British Consulate in Jeddah to her situation. Her lawyers say it has been difficult to communicate with her.  Her treatment has extended to depriving her of food and water, depriving her of toilet facilities, physical assault, and control of her ability to marry who she wishes and creating a situation in which she feels compelled to marry as a means of escape,  one of her lawyers said, per the Telegraph. Mohammed Al-Jeffery disputes his daughter's claims; he says he took her to Saudi Arabia to  save her life,  and that he  fear[s] she will go back to her old destructive lifestyle  if she is returned to the UK. That lifestyle involved taking drugs, not focusing on her education, and  going to clubs and spending time with older men,  his lawyer says. Mohammed Al-Jeffery also says Amina shaved her own head.

"(May 17, 2016  7:00 PM CDT) The Senate passed legislation Tuesday that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, rejecting the fierce objections of a US ally and setting Congress on a collision course with the Obama administration, the AP reports. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, approved by voice vote, had triggered a threat from Riyadh to pull billions of dollars from the US economy if the bill is enacted. The legislation, sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chuck Schumer, D-NY, gives victims' families the right to sue in US court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks that killed thousands in New York, the Washington, DC, area, and Pennsylvania. The House still must act on the legislation. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims have urged the Obama administration to declassify and release 28 pages of US intelligence that allegedly discusses possible Saudi involvement in the attacks. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir denied earlier this month that the kingdom made any threats over the bill. He said Riyadh had warned that investor confidence in the US would shrink if the bill became law.  In fact, what they [Congress] are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,  Al-Jubeir said in a May 3 statement.

These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as  a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves.  The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prize—but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy.

Avalanche warnings are in effect for parts of the Washington Cascades and the Mount Hood area. The group was on the third day of a guided backcountry outing meant to last five days, and was comprised of two guides and six skiers, the AP reports. The owner of the company that organized the trip says they were all  fit, proficient downhill skiers  and that the avalanche  caught them by surprise  from above. The two injured skiers—one with two broken legs, another with a broken thigh bone—are still on the mountain, with medics, until conditions clear so rescue efforts can resume. So far this season, 12 people have died in avalanches, six of those since Sunday.",Avalanche Kills 2 Skiers in Oregon,Avalanche Kills ____ Skiers in Oregon,2,Trans( two ),1

I never expected to win. I just got lucky,  says Raleigh retiree Charles W. Jackson Jr., who's played the same five numbers in Powerball and Mega Millions, sometimes altering the sixth, ever since they appeared in a fortune cookie given to his young stepdaughter two years ago, reports the News & Observer. WRAL, however, reports the cookie was given to his granddaughter at a Vietnamese restaurant. Following Saturday's draw, the 66-year-old had no idea how much he'd won because he doesn't watch the news. He opted for a lump-sum payout of $233 million, or $158 million after taxes.  I hope it don't change me a lot,  he says, adding,  I'm still going to wear jeans—maybe newer ones.  He'll give $1 million to his brother—they agreed to such a deal if either of them ever won a big prize, per WRAL—and also plans to donate to the Wounded Warrior Project, Shriners Hospital for Children, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

"(Jul 20, 2014  8:40 AM CDT) RJ Reynolds is about $23.6 billion poorer after a Florida jury awarded a widow a whopping $23.6 billion in damages over her husband's death from lung cancer. As the Pensacola News Journal notes, it's one of the largest verdicts ever against a tobacco company, and a Reynolds exec tells the AP that the company will fight the  grossly excessive  award.  This verdict goes far beyond the realm of reasonableness and fairness, and is completely inconsistent with the evidence presented,  he said.  They'll appeal because they always appeal, that's the attitude they have,  said a lawyer for widow Cynthia Robinson, whose husband, a longtime smoker, died in 1996.  But no matter how the ball bounces with the appeal, it's not the money that's important in this case.  Robinson's suit is among thousands of individual lawsuits filed after Florida's Supreme Court threw out a $145 billion class-action settlement in 2006.

The Florida man says his project, which has been hiatus for a while, is back on since the global economy is doing better; now he just needs to raise the $1 billion he needs from backers to start construction.  The Freedom Ship will be the largest vessel ever built,  Gooch says. It will be 25 stories high and one mile long, able to hold 50,000 residents, 20,000 crew members, and as many as 40,000 guests at a time, the New York Daily News reports. It will also have an airport, shopping centers, hotels, casinos, schools, a library, a hospital, parks, art and entertainment, banks, athletic and recreational facilities, and even aquariums. But it will have to be permanently at sea, since at 2.7 million tons (and four times longer than the Queen Mary II), it will be too big to enter a port. It would circle the globe every two years, the Telegraph reports, anchoring off big cities and ferrying residents ashore via commuter aircraft and hydrofoils. In fact, just 30% of its time will be spent actually in transit. The ship would set off from the US East Coast in June, spend the summer months in Europe and Christmas in Africa, then hit Australia in time for its summer.

"(Feb 17, 2020  11:16 AM) A 6-year-old girl is recovering from minor injuries after a mountain lion (also known as a cougar or puma) attacked her in a California nature preserve. KGO reports that the child was walking with her parents, four other adults, and four other children around 10am Sunday in the Rancho San Antonio Preserve, which is adjacent to the Rancho San Antonio County Park in Cupertino, when a mountain lion emerged from the bushes and started mauling her. An adult in the group started punching the big cat in the ribs, and it eventually ran off. NBC Bay Area reports it was a friend of the girl's father who fought off the cougar, believed to be anywhere from 100 to 160 pounds, during the attack, which took place about a mile from the preserve's front entrance. The girl, who received some minor puncture wounds to her calf, is expected to fully recover, authorities say. A message on the preserve's website says that it's closed until further notice; NBC notes the decision to shut it down came after an overnight search for the mountain lion turned up nothing. Mountain lion attacks are said to be rare, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife confirming only 17 such attacks on people over the last century.

The US Geological Survey says the quake struck 49 miles off the island's northwest coast at a shallow depth of 6 miles. Two aftershocks, of 4.7- and 4.6-magnitude, hit within 20 minutes in the same region at the same depth. Kiara Hernández, spokeswoman for the island's Emergency Management Agency, tells the AP that there were no immediate reports of damage and that there was no risk of tsunami.

Hernández says emergency management officials were already on alert for the approaching Tropical Depression Karen and communicated quickly with mayors and others across the island to check on any damage. The National Guard also had been activated for the storm, and schools and government offices remained closed as heavy rains were forecast for Puerto Rico on Tuesday, with warnings of possible flooding and landslides.

Lawyer Robert Bourgi, a onetime aide to the politicians, made the accusations in a radio station interview today, Reuters reports. Bourgi claims that between 1995 and 2005 he acted as a  bag carrier  and handed over the money, which was sometimes hidden in African drums and was paid out by the leaders of former French colonies like Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Congo.  I saw Chirac and Villepin count the money,  Bourgi said. Both former leaders plan to sue. Villepin is seven months away from a possible run against Nicolas Sarkozy, who Bourgi also advised, though the lawyer noted that he never brought any cash to the current president.

The company knew about a serious listeria problem at one of its production plants years before an outbreak linked to the company's products killed three people, the FDA says. In what food safety attorney Bill Marler tells ABC are among the worst results he's seen in his career, inspections found listeria on surfaces at an Oklahoma plant five times in 2013, 10 times in 2014, and once in January this year. The FDA told the company it had failed to show that its  cleaning and sanitizing program is effective,  but Blue Bell failed to make major changes to procedures, the Houston Chronicle reports. Blue Bell halted operations at the plant last month before recalling all its products. The report also outlines cleaning problems at plants in Alabama and Texas, the Wall Street Journal reports. A Blue Bell spokesman tells ABC that the company  thought our cleaning process took care of any problems, but in hindsight, it was not adequate, which is why we are currently conducting such a comprehensive re-evaluation of all our operations.  The FDA report could lead to major lawsuits against the company, which says it will be months before its products are back on the market, the Chronicle reports.  There's no question that Blue Bell’s Oklahoma plant was out of control from a listeria perspective,  Marler tells the Journal, adding that  it appears Blue Bell did nothing about it.",FDA: Blue Bell Knew About Deadly Bug in 2013,FDA: Blue Bell Knew About Deadly Bug in ____,2013,Copy( 2013 ),0

Indeed, the list has existed since last year, the official said, but it's been held up by efforts to streamline the US' weapons export rules. It's a problem that's eating at companies like Northrop Grumman, which is eager for a bigger market for its Global Hawk surveillance drones.

Bank shares rose sharply yesterday and today, and some investors said the results were better than they feared. The Wall Street Journal writes that weak banks might have trouble enticing the private investors they'll need, while the New York Times is more optimistic, saying  the big bailouts for the banks may be over.  Stronger banks will be permitted to repay TARP funds and escape restrictions on pay and dividends, while weaker ones will have to address their shortfalls. According to the Times, the weak banks will need less than $100 billion to survive a deep recession.

The wildlife authority says Byamukama could have received a life sentence if he had been tried by a special wildlife court.

The move, which takes effect at 8pm Thursday, came after the Supreme Court partially restored an executive order from President Trump that was widely criticized as a ban on Muslims, the AP reports. Visas that have already been approved will not be revoked, but instructions issued by the State Department say that new applicants from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran, and Yemen must prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or sibling already in the United States to be eligible. The same requirement, with some exceptions, holds for would-be refugees from all nations who are still awaiting approval for admission to the US. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be close relationships, according to the guidelines that were issued in a cable sent to all US embassies and consulates late on Wednesday. As far as business or professional links are concerned, the State Department says a legitimate relationship must be  formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading  the ban.","US Tightens Visa Rules for 6 Nations, Refugees","US Tightens Visa Rules for ____ Nations, Refugees",6,Trans( six ),1

Alan Nevil died later in a hospital, but police say the boy—whom they found having celebratory sex with his 12-year-old girlfriend—admitted to shooting the Nevils on his girlfriend's orders; she had lied, telling him her stepdad had sexually abused her, police say.  He took responsibility almost immediately,  a detective said during a hearing Wednesday.

The Washingtonian dives headlong into the bizarre tale of Thompson, who was behind what is believed to be one of the biggest US charity frauds ever. Thompson was born John Donald Cody, a man incapable of crying due a lack of tear glands. Cody worked in military intelligence and then as a lawyer until 1984, when he disappeared amid fraud charges. He reappeared years later as Thompson, a member of the nonprofit United States Navy Veterans Association and a prolific political donor and hobnobber. By 2009, the Navy Veterans Association was doing well for itself: It had 41 state chapters and had raised around $100 million from donors. Thompson wasn't doing too shabby either: He had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to John McCain, Mitt Romney, and other Republicans and got his photo taken with George W. Bush.

Shortly before 9:40am local time, Sean Anderson yelled that he and his wife, Sandy, were coming out of the Malheur, and they were arrested without incident, the New York Times reports. A couple of minutes later, Jeff Banta emerged and was also peacefully taken into custody. That's when the last holdout, David Fry, apparently decided to renege on the deal to give himself up.  Unless my grievances are heard, I won't come out,  he reportedly shouted, informing officials he was feeling suicidal as he sat alone in a tent. He then added:  I have to stand my ground. It's liberty or death. I will not go another day as a slave to this system.  Among his grievances, per the Times, is that his tax money is being used to fund abortions. Just before 11am PST, Fry announced on the live feed that he was having one more cigarette and cookie, and then he said he was going out to meet with the authorities. The FBI confirmed at 11am that Fry was in custody, per the Oregonian. Gavin Seim, a right-wing activist who had set up the live feed, said after Fry had walked out that  America needs to learn from what just happened here.

"(Sep 8, 2013  8:14 AM CDT) Amid all the uproar over chemical weapons in Syria comes this surprising revelation: What could be the earliest archaeological evidence of chemical weapons was uncovered in the country—and it is some 1,700 years old. A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains Discovery News. It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation:  I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel.  Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

I have made mistakes, I'm sorry for the time and resources I have taken from the court,  she said. Bronfman is accused of illegally bringing young women into the US for the Nxivm cult and using part of her $210 million fortune to silence the group's enemies with legal action.  She used her incredible wealth as a means of intimidation, threat and exacting revenge on individuals who challenged its dogmas,  Brooklyn Federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis said in sentencing her.

A ruling is expected soon from an appeals court that recently lifted protections for wolves in Wyoming. In Congress, wolf-hunting supporters aren't giving up, even though a Minnesota representative was instrumental in killing an effort that would have allowed the three western Great Lakes states to resume wolf hunting, the AP reports. Gray wolves were once hunted to the brink of extinction in most of the country, but they recovered under Endangered Species Act protections and reintroduction programs. They now number over 5,500 in the lower 48 states, including nearly 3,800 in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has repeatedly tried to remove wolves in the three states from the endangered species list, but courts have stymied those efforts. Now, a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is looking at the issue. Lawmakers from the region have also tried to attach riders to various bills in Congress that would  delist  wolves, return management responsibilities to the states, and bar further court challenges.

An email from Leon Russell Records to the AP says Russell died in Nashville  last night,  citing Russell's wife. Russell had heart bypass surgery in July and was recovering at the time of his death. He had been planning on resuming touring in January, the email said. Russell's website says the musician died Sunday, also citing his wife. Besides his music, Russell was known for his striking appearance: wispy white hair halfway down his back and covering much of his face. He wrote Joe Cocker's  Delta Lady  and in 1969 put together Cocker's  Mad Dogs and Englishmen  tour, which spawned a hit double album and a documentary. As a musician, primarily a pianist, he played on the Beach Boys'  California Girls  and Jan and Dean's  Surf City.  He also played guitar and bass. Russell produced and played on recording sessions for Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Ike and Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones, and many others. He recorded hit songs himself like  Tight Rope  and  Lady Blue  and participated in  The Concert for Bangla Desh.

"(Feb 27, 2017  10:59 AM) The Trump administration isn't straying from its  America first  mantra: It plans to recommend some significant reallocation of funds in the 2018 budget, bumping defense spending by 10%, or $54 billion. An equivalent amount will be shaved off non-security spending for the budget year starting Oct. 1; law enforcement and veterans may also see additional funds come their way. The Washington Post reports that while few specifics have been released, officials did name foreign aid as being subject to  large reductions ; the paper points out that makes up one of the more minor parts of the federal budget. How the Office of Management and Budget official that briefed reporters put things, per Politico:  This budget expects the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding in the past.  Individual agencies can push back on recommendations with proposed changes. The OMB will pen the official fiscal 2018 request, which then goes to Congress in mid-March. The upshot for the AP: Trump's first pass won't reduce what is projected to be a budget deficit of $500 billion, and things will likely get ugly:  Democrats and some Republicans are certain to resist the cuts to domestic agencies, and any legislation to implement them would have to overcome a filibuster threat by Senate Democrats. A government shutdown is a real possibility.  The Wall Street Journal explains one legal hurdle: a 2011 law that stipulates that defense and non-defense funding have to increase by the same amount; Congress would have to amend it.

He then went to great lengths to avoid prosecution—claiming to be a quadriplegic and even pretending he was comatose. The Telegraph reports authorities tried at least two times to haul him to court; in both instances, his condition suddenly grew more serious and he admitted himself to the hospital. Surveillance video proved to be his undoing: He was spotted walking normally at grocery stores (police used his supermarket card to track him) and filmed driving through a toll booth; nurses and doctors later saw him feeding himself, wiping his face, and writing, reports the BBC.

"(Feb 20, 2015  9:57 AM) Three London teens on their winter break are believed to have skipped town and headed to Syria to join up with ISIS, British police said today, per the BBC. Shamima Begum, 15, and two classmates—Kadiza Sultana, 16, and a 15-year-old friend whose parents asked for anonymity—reportedly got on a plane at Gatwick Airport on Tuesday and flew to Istanbul. They had given their families  plausible reasons  for disappearing for the day, police say, but Shamima and the other 15-year-old were reported missing by Tuesday night; Kadiza was called in on Wednesday morning. Their families are said to be  devastated,  according to Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command unit, but they're hoping the girls may still be in Turkey and that they'll see social media pleas for them to return.  [Syria] is an extremely dangerous place, and we have seen reports of what life is like for them and how restricted their lives become,  Walton said, per the Guardian.  The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those under the control of [the] Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK … with very few options to secure their safe return.  To assure the girls that it's their safety that's paramount, the Metropolitan Police also tweeted a statement from Walton today that said,  This is not about criminalizing people, this is about preventing tragedies,  as well as listing a number to call for the girls or anyone who knows where they may be.",Cops Fear 3 UK Schoolgirls Are on Their Way to Syria,Cops Fear ____ UK Schoolgirls Are on Their Way to Syria,3,Trans( Three ),1
"(May 7, 2020  5:07 PM CDT) Anyone who's survived hospitalization for a case of COVID-19 will not be welcome in the US military. A mild case wouldn't keep a recruit out of service, NPR reports, but a hospital stay would be  permanently disqualifying,  according to a Pentagon memo. Recruits can apply for a waiver, as they can for other illnesses and conditions, including asthma and heart disease. But there's no framework yet for granting an exception, per the Military Times; specific guidance would have to be handed down. A Pentagon spokeswoman declined to say why a COVID-19 hospitalization would prohibit military service when stays for other viral illnesses do not. A Defense Department official listed as reasons the fact that little is known about the long-term effects of the disease, as well as the possibility that a coronavirus patient might need care again, per CNN. The new policy is spelled out in an internal Pentagon memo that's considered interim guidance. It's not yet known whether patients who have recovered from the illness can become infected again, the World Health Organization has said.

"(Jun 3, 2019  7:17 PM CDT) Terrifying surveillance video shows a 3-year-old Georgia girl jump into her apartment complex pool wearing an inner tube around her waist—only for the inflatable device to flip her upside down, trapping her head under the water. Eventually Kali Dallis' body came free of the tube, but after flailing in an attempt to get above water, she ended up back underneath the surface. That's when her 10-year-old sister Jayla, who had just exited the pool, turned around and saw what was going on. The surveillance footage also captured Jayla racing across the pavement and leaping into the pool, grabbing her sister, and dragging her out of the water. Thanks to Jayla, the girls' aunt and an apartment manager who took turns doing CPR, a witness who called 911, and the quick response of a local police officer, Kali was just released Friday after two weeks in the hospital.  She was, like, heavy, so I had to pull her by her hair, then I grabbed her by her waist and pulled her up,  Jayla tells WSB-TV of rescuing her sister. Meanwhile, Sgt. Ed Lyons was nearby, checking reports in his police car, when the call came in. He has his own 6-year-old daughter, he tells WSB:  I saw my little girl laying there.

Thousands of eared grebes dived into roads and parking lots across Cedar City and St. George, apparently mistaking the flat surfaces for water, the LA Times reports. About 1,500 birds died in the incident, but many more survived the plunge—officials have so far rescued more than 3,000 of the duck-like birds, and released them into the water. It's not unheard of for birds to occasionally take such fatal plunges,  but this is by far the largest we've had,  a spokesman for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said.

The sea has started to come inland, it forced us to move up to the hilltop and rebuild our village there away from the sea,  he says. Nararo is one of six islands in the Solomon Islands to be severely eroded by rising sea levels, which are climbing seven to 10 millimeters per year in the area, or three times the global average. Nuatambu Island has lost half of its habitable land since 2011, and Taro in Choiseul province may soon become the world's first provincial capital to be abandoned due to climate change, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. But another five uninhabited reef islands have vanished entirely, according to a new study—the first that scientifically  confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people,  researchers say, per the Guardian. Scientists used sea-level records, wave models, and aerial and satellite imagery from 1947 to 2015 to evaluate sea level changes in 33 reef islands, they write at the Conversation. The 21 exposed to  higher wave energy in addition to sea-level rise experienced greatly accelerated loss compared with more sheltered islands.  The remaining 12, situated in a low wave energy area,  experienced little noticeable change in shorelines despite being exposed to similar sea-level rise.  Villagers forced to flee sometimes find space on ancestral land. But  the majority of land is tightly controlled by traditional owners, so moving one group of people onto other peoples' lands has been the source of ethnic conflict,  a study author tells the Washington Post. He adds  the rates we have recently seen in the Solomons will be experienced globally in the second half of this century.

The Coconino County Sheriff's Office has confirmed on Facebook that the body of Jerold Joseph Williams was found last night in Kaibab National Forest, where he disappeared while camping last Thursday.

A previous report from ABC15 suggests his mother was with him at the time, and that he vanished from her view as he started to chase grasshoppers. More than 500 volunteers searched the rugged terrain for the missing boy over a five-day span alongside military helicopters carrying night vision equipment and crews with dogs and ATVs, reports ABC15. The AP describes volunteers trudging shoulder-to-shoulder through thick vegetation in the pouring rain yesterday in search of Jerold, whose body was found by a member of the search team.

That entry and others describing the journal writer breaking into a house to steal food or keeping tabs on the ensuing manhunt were read to a Pennsylvania jury during Frein's murder trial on Wednesday, reports the NBC News. The 33-year-old is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson II and critically injuring Trooper Alex Douglass outside the Blooming Grove barracks in Pike County on Sept. 12, 2014. The shooting spawned a 48-day manhunt before Frein was captured near an abandoned airplane hangar on Oct. 30.  This massive search cannot last forever,  an Oct. 4 entry reads. Days later, Frein allegedly wrote,  30 Days. A lot longer than I expected to last.

"(Mar 20, 2014  4:10 PM CDT) Prior to today, the official scientific answer to the question,  How many scents can the human nose detect?  was a measly 10,000. But now, thanks to a new study in Science, the answer is 1 trillion, give or take. Researchers had long assumed that the first number, based on relatively rudimentary tests in the 1920s, was way off the mark, and the new study is the first significant one to apply modern methods to revise it, reports Nature. The 1 trillion figure is seen as an average, with some people able to detect as  few  as 80 million odors and others able to pick up on a mind-boggling  thousand trillion  of them, according to the scientists' extrapolations.  Ten thousand is kind of pathetic—it’s a pretty low number,  says molecular neurobiologist Leslie Voshall of the Rockefeller University, a co-author of the study.  It led to the idea that humans have a comparatively low sense of smell.  For their experiment, the scientists used  a procedure similar to a hearing exam, in which listeners must try to distinguish between two tones,  explains the Washington Post. Researchers combined 128 different odor molecules to create composite scents of varying complexity, then ran them by 26 test subjects. Participants got three vials—two had identical odors and the third was slightly different—and had to pick the odd one out, reports NPR. The analysis gets more complicated than that, but after hundreds of experiments on each subject, researchers extrapolated the results to arrive at the 1 trillion average. The study is being well received in the field.  Their work confirms that smell is an incredibly rich, variable, and nuanced medium,  says one olfactory scientist not involved with the research.

A Kitson lawyer tells the AP that Hudson, which operates two stores at LAX for Kitson,  is taking advantage of the post-9/11 airport restrictions  and refused to sell liter bottles of water for $2.55 at the Kitson stores it operates because it was making too much money selling water at higher prices elsewhere. According to airport authority rules, products sold in LAX terminals cannot be priced more than 18% above their  street value,  NBC notes. With $5 water,  I don't know what street that is, but that's not my street,  a Kitson spokeswoman tells Forbes. Hudson, which accuses Kitson of angling to get its own airport retail space, counters that Kitson only started trying to sell water after it was accused of breach of contract when its founder turned up at the airport stores to berate employees. Anyone who thinks that the company is motivated  by an altruistic concern over how much consumers are paying for water at LAX has either never shopped at a Kitson store or is really naive,  a Hudson lawyer tells the AP.

While faulting pilot error in last month's plane crash that killed a total of 98 people in Karachi, Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that 262 of 860 commercial pilots in Pakistan  don't have flying experience  and  did not take the exam themselves,  per CNN.  They give money and have a dummy candidate sit in their place,  Khan said, per Al Jazeera. The shocking revelation came as Khan reported that the pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight that crashed near Jinnah International Airport on May 22 had initially tried to land without lowering the landing gear. The engines scrubbed the runway and later failed. It's unclear if the pilots had legitimate licenses, per Business Insider, though PIA has now grounded 150 of its 434 pilots.

The women—who appear on the cover and in a photo essay inside—describe how they were drugged and abused by a man many of them had trusted and looked up to, and how they felt it was impossible to come forward.  I felt like a prisoner; I felt I was kidnapped and hiding in plain sight,  says Barbara Bowman, who accuses Cosby of abusing her when she was a teenager in the '80s.  I could have walked down any street of Manhattan at any time and said, 'I'm being raped and drugged by Bill Cosby,' but who the hell would have believed me? Nobody, nobody.   Each story is awful in its own right,  writes Noreen Malone at New York.  But the horror is multiplied by the sheer volume of seeing them together, reading them together, considering their shared experience.  An empty chair on the cover symbolizes women who have not yet come forward, notes Daniel Politi at Slate, who believes the magazine's jarring cover may do  more to destroy the once-beloved comic's reputation than anything that has been released so far.  And Cosby's legacy is continuing to unravel, reports the New York Times.

With the same confidence he showed 15 years ago when he routed the field, Montoya sliced his way through the field twice and won his second Indianapolis 500 today.  This is too much,  he said in victory lane, the winner's wreath around his neck and the traditional bottle of milk in his hand. Flanked by his children, he looked everywhere for his wife: It was a far different scene from 2000, when the fearless Colombian was single, childless and using Indy cars as a stepping stone to Formula One. But his career has been a series of ups-and-downs through F1, NASCAR, and finally back to IndyCar with motorsports icon Roger Penske. This victory was almost certainly going to go to a Team Penske or Chip Ganassi Racing driver, which had a combined 9 cars in the field. Proving that Indianapolis is their own personal playground, Penske and Ganassi drivers led the majority of the laps today and turned the final restart with 15 laps to go into a three-car thriller between Penske teammates Montoya and Will Power, and Ganassi driver Scott Dixon.

The violence broke out yesterday after protesters stormed a base belonging to Libya Shield, a grouping of militias tasked with maintaining security. The protesters were demanding that militias leave their camp and submit to the full authority of Libya's security forces. The death toll is likely to increase public backlash against militias, who have been accused of acting with impunity, abusing citizens, and enforcing their own agendas. Libyan officials have provided few details of the clashes. Witnesses say some of the protesters came armed. The camp was believed to house dozens of Libya Shield militiamen, while the protesters who attacked their camp were estimated to number several hundred.

The plan, which is believed to be the  pet project  of Chinese President Xi Jinping, calls for integration by 2020 into a metropolis almost the size of Idaho, the South China Morning Post reports. In recent months, moves to spread things like government departments—and polluting industries—around the region have been stepped up.

Agents arrested Yaser Abdel Said, 63, in Justin, some 36 miles northwest of Dallas. The Egyptian-born suspect had been sought on a capital murder warrant since the New Year's Day 2008 fatal shootings of the two Lewisville High School students, Sarah Yaser Said, 17, and Amina Yaser Said, 18, the AP reports. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2014. A police report says a family member told investigators that the suspect threatened  bodily harm  against Sarah for going on a date with a non-Muslim. The mother, Patricia Said, fled with her daughters in the week before their deaths because she was in  great fear for her life.  Gail Gattrell, the sisters’ great-aunt, has called the deaths an  honor killing,  in which a woman is murdered by a relative to protect her family’s honor. The teenage sisters were found shot multiple times in a cab outside a motel in Irving, a Dallas suburb. Police found them after one of the girls called 911 from a cellphone and said she was dying.  Help,  said a crying voice on the 911 recording, later determined by police to be that of Sarah Said.  I’m dying. Oh my God. Stop it.  Police could not immediately find the teens after the 7:33pm call.

Myerson died Dec. 14 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif, officials say. The Bronx-born Myerson was hailed as a Jewish, feminist Jackie Robinson—a groundbreaker for her religion and sex—after parlaying her stunning 1945 Miss America victory into national celebrity. The 5-foot-10 dark-haired beauty, unlike her predecessors, accentuated her intelligence. Myerson landed a series of television jobs, from game show hostess to on-air reporter, before her appointment as New York City's chief consumer watchdog in 1969. The popular Myerson then helped Ed Koch win the 1977 mayoral race, deflecting rumors that he was gay. Koch later appointed her Cultural Affairs commissioner, but Myerson's carefully cultivated image crumbled in the mid-1980s when a city background check exposed her as an insanely jealous woman who harassed an ex-boyfriend and his new lover. She repeatedly invoked her right against self-incrimination in a 1986 corruption probe of a subsequent boyfriend, Carl Capasso, with purported mob ties. Myerson was later acquitted on charges of trying to fix Capasso's divorce case, but add a couple of shoplifting convictions, and the damage was done. Yet the Miss America Organization says Myerson will be remembered for her unwavering commitment to equality:  Bess used her Miss America title to fight anti-Semitism and racial bigotry as she traveled around the country,  the organization says.",Miss America Later Caught in Scandals Dead at 90,Miss America Later Caught in Scandals Dead at ____,90,Copy( 90 ),0

Also known by names including  Cloud Nine,   Five Minutes in Heaven,   Blackout,  and  Good Kid's High,  the game involves briefly cutting off the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in a euphoric feeling. But it's dangerous, especially when played alone; some children use belts slung from doorknobs to achieve the high. The advocacy group GASP estimates nearly 400 children died from playing the Choking Game between 1995 and 2007, but notes that it's difficult to track exact numbers since many of the deaths are reported as suicides. Indeed, rumors went around that Garrett had committed suicide, which is one of the reasons his parents are speaking out.  Please know that his senseless death was not intentional. He took this terrible 'game' too far,  they write in a Facebook post that has been shared more than 1,500 times so far.

It was Davis' willingness to buck the establishment that helped turn the NFL into the establishment—the most successful sports league in American history. Davis was charming, cantankerous, and compassionate—a man who when his wife suffered a serious heart attack in the 1970s moved into her hospital room. But he was best known as a rebel, a man who established a team whose silver-and-black colors and pirate logo symbolized his attitude toward authority, both on the field and off. Davis was one of the most important figures in NFL history. That was most evident during the 1980s when he fought in court—and won—for the right to move his team from Oakland to Los Angeles. Even after he moved them back to the Bay Area in 1995, he went to court, suing for $1.2 billion to establish that he still owned the rights to the LA market. Davis, elected in 1992 to the Football Hall of Fame, also was a trailblazer. He hired the first black head coach of the modern era, Art Shell in 1988. He hired the first Latino coach, Tom Flores; and the first woman CEO, Amy Trask.

Starting in 2018, civil rights pioneer Viola Desmond—aka the  Rosa Parks of Canada —will have her mug on the country's $10 bill, the Toronto Star reports. The Globe and Mail relays the story that made Desmond famous in November 1946, when her car broke down in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. While she was waiting for her car to be repaired, she went to see a movie—but because she was nearsighted, she couldn't see well from the balcony seats where black patrons were made to sit. Instead, Desmond took a seat in the whites-only section on the floor. She refused to move when asked and ended up being arrested and spending the night in jail. She was charged and convicted of tax evasion (her balcony ticket cost a penny less than a floor ticket would have) and was fined $26. Desmond took her case all the way up to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, though her appeal was eventually dismissed. Desmond, who died in 1965 at the age of 50, was officially pardoned in 2010 by the region's black female lieutenant governor.

Turns out, those  accidents  were the work of a criminally imaginative body shop owner, say prosecutors. They charged 63-year-old Ron Galati and 40 other people—including his wife, his son, a former city cop, a soon-to-be-former city worker, tow-truck drivers, and insurance adjusters—with an elaborate scheme to concoct accident reports involving fictitious deer collisions, reports NBC Philadelphia. They also filed bogus claims involving  geese, dogs, cartons of fruit, flying metal and falling concrete,  says the DA's office, as per Philadelphia Magazine. But deer were the apparent specialty, with Galati allegedly keeping deer blood and carcasses at American Collision and Auto Center to use in staged photos, or  Hollywood photos,  as the DA says he called them.

NTSB officials declined to comment directly on whether a petition calling for a fresh investigation will indeed lead to a new probe. But they stressed that there was no radar evidence of anything  intercepting the plane,  and that the patterns of damage were not consistent with a bomb or missile strike, Politico reports.

Instead, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter to first threaten Israel and then to send the US a pointed message or two.  After negotiations, in Zionist regime they said they had no more concern about Iran for next 25 years,  the tweet read.  I'd say … you will not see next 25 years. … Until then, struggling, heroic and jihadi morale will leave no moment of serenity for Zionists.

He seemed to close the door on future talks with the US about other topics, stressing,  We allowed negotiation with US only on nuclear issue for certain reasons, in other areas we did not and will not allow negotiations with US,  adding that  [US] negotiation is means of infiltration and imposition of their wills.

"(Mar 4, 2015  9:00 AM) Two dramatically different portraits of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are expected to emerge when prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers give their opening statements today at his federal death penalty trial. Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother? Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks? Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear they will try to show that at the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev, then 19, looked up to his older brother, Tamerlan, 26, and was heavily influenced by him; they plan to portray Tamerlan—who died following a shootout with police days after the bombings—as the mastermind of the attack. But prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal participant who acted of his own free will. Tsarnaev faces 30 charges in the bombings and the fatal shooting days later of a police officer from MIT; 17 of the charges carry the possibility of the death penalty. A jury of 10 women and eight men were chosen yesterday to hear the case, which is to be held in US District Court in Boston under extremely tight security. The trial, which is expected to last three to four months, will be split into two phases: one phase to decide guilt and the other to decide punishment. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the same jury will decide whether he's sentenced to life in prison or death.

Sadly, it's no joke. As Bloomberg explains, one such collector made $454,000 in a single year, most of it in bonuses for getting people to pay up.

ECMC is one of about 30 such  guaranty agencies  that help the government run its student-loan program. When the agencies collect money from defaulted borrowers, they keep their own cut, and with so many students graduating with massive debt loads these days, business is booming.

"(Apr 10, 2020  3:32 AM CDT) It looked like a white splotch on the underside of a Neanderthal stone tool. But a microscope showed it was a bunch of fibers twisted around each other. Further examination revealed it was the first direct evidence that Neanderthals could make string, and the oldest known direct evidence for string-making overall, researchers say. The find implies our evolutionary cousins had some understanding of numbers and the trees that furnished the raw material, they say. It's the latest discovery to show Neanderthals were smarter than modern-day people often assume. Bruce Hardy, of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and colleagues report the discovery in a paper released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. The string hints at the possibility of other abilities, like making bags, mats, nets, and fabric, they said. It came from an archaeological site in the Rhone River valley of southeastern France, and it's about 40,000 to 50,000 years old, the AP reports. Researchers don't know how Neanderthals used the string or even whether it had been originally attached to the stone cutting tool. It was made of fiber from the inner bark of trees. Neanderthals twisted three bundles of fibers together counterclockwise, and then twisted these bundles together clockwise to make the string.

"(Feb 11, 2016  12:08 PM) Euthanasia is itself not without controversy; the euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of the mentally ill even more so. It's an infrequent practice but one on the rise in the Netherlands, which is thought to have seen no more than five such cases in 1997 but 42 in 2013. Still,  little is known  about these cases, write researchers in a report published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. And so they reviewed the particulars of 66 patients who opted for EAS in the country from 2011 to 2014. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder, but there was also psychosis, PTSD, and anxiety and long-term eating disorders (most had more than one condition). About half had attempted suicide; almost all had a comorbidity (ranging from cancer to arthritis), though the study calls out one healthy 70-year-old woman who simply found her life a  living hell  in the year after her husband's death. As for how they came to end their lives,  the reality of implementing such programs is messy,  Reuters notes. In 32% of the cases, the patient had been refused EAS. The physicians for three of those 21 patients ultimately reversed their decisions; the other 18 got approval from a new physician. In 24% of the cases, there was physician disagreement, per a press release, and the New York Times points out that while most patients had long treatment histories, 56% had turned down at least some treatment. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Paul S. Applebaum sees further  red flags,  among them the 20% who had never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, the  ratio of women to men (2.3 to 1), and the 56% of cases in which social isolation or loneliness was important enough to be mentioned,  raising  the concern that physician-assisted death served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention.

That's OK, the US government doesn't mind—to the tune of some $107 billion it's given in federal contracts and grants to corporations doing business with Tehran. As the New York Times reports, a large portion of that went to Iran's energy sector—a huge financial boon to both Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Both the Obama and Bush administrations have spotty records, and it's difficult to exert control over foreign companies or foreign subsidiaries of US companies. Recent political tensions have led various companies to pull out of Iran, but according to the Times, 49 of 74 firms that have dealt both with Tehran and Washington have no stated intention of leaving the former.",US Gave $107B to Firms Dodging Iran Sanctions,US Gave $____B to Firms Dodging Iran Sanctions,107,Copy( 107 ),0
"(Dec 11, 2020  12:09 AM) The pandemic appears to have done what years of increasingly dire warnings about climate change couldn't. Global carbon dioxide emissions fell by an estimated 7% in 2020, the largest drop on record, according to the Global Carbon Project. The emissions reduction was mainly the result of lockdowns keeping people at home and massively reducing international travel, Axios reports. According to a report in the journal Earth System Science Data, carbon emissions dived 12% in the US and 11% in Europe but just 1.7% in China. Study co-author Corinne LeQuere, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia, says the drop was less pronounced in China because the country had much less of a second wave and more of its emissions come from industry, not transportation, reports the AP.  The restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19 led to dramatic and unprecedented changes in society, and this caused large changes in CO2 emissions,  the report states.  All countries had significant deviations from their previous emission trends.   Of course, lockdown is absolutely not the way to tackle climate change,  LeQuere says, but emissions growth had already slowed noticeably in 2019 and scientists hope that year could mark the peak year for carbon emissions. Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says that to limit warming, the economic recovery shouldn't  go down the old path,  the Guardian reports.

The agency calls the uniforms a necessity, but for many on Capitol Hill it was just another sign of the TSA's cluelessness.  When we’re losing essential services and they’re closing down or threatening to close down all sorts of important government activities, to have them cut the deal on $50 million for uniforms is absolutely outrageous,  complains a Florida Republican. The TSA's recent announcement that it will allow small knives on flights—but still not full size shampoos and toiletries—is also angering many, including the families of people killed on 9/11, reports the AP.

"(Apr 20, 2015  9:57 AM CDT) Tomorrow, former SS guard Oskar Groening, 93, goes on trial in Germany on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in a trial that will focus on whether legally he can be found an accessory to murder for his actions. Groening is accused of helping operate the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland between May and June 1944, when some 425,000 Jews from Hungary were brought there and at least 300,000 almost immediately gassed to death. His job was to deal with the belongings stolen from victims. Prosecutors allege among other things that he was charged with helping collect and tally money that was found, which has earned him the moniker  the accountant of Auschwitz  from the German media. Groening's trial is the first to test a line of German legal reasoning opened by the 2011 trial of former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk on allegations he was a Sobibor death camp guard, which has unleashed an 11th-hour wave of new investigations of Nazi war crimes suspects. Prosecutors argue that anyone who was a death camp guard can be charged as an accessory to murders committed there, even without evidence of involvement in a specific death. Groening has openly acknowledged serving as an SS non-commissioned officer at Auschwitz, though he denies committing any crimes. Groening has said he felt an obligation to talk about his past to confront those who deny the Holocaust.  I want to tell those deniers that I have seen the crematoria, I have seen the burning pits, and I want to assure you that these atrocities happened,  he said.

The premise is pretty simple: People send in photos of their former loves, and facial-recognition software then scans the possible matches available to find a close approximation.  People have a type and it's not necessarily about height or race or hair color, but a lot of it is about face shape,  Talia Goldstein, founder of matchmaking service Three Day Rule tells Mashable. TDR is teaming up with Match.com on the service, which costs $5,000. Those who pony up also get a professional matchmaker assigned to their case, who will vet potential matches and even go on  pre-dates  to screen out duds. Much of the reaction to this can be summed up thusly:  It's creepy as hell,  writes Adam Clark Estes at Gizmodo. He wonders who will be more disturbed—your exes or your new partners who have been  robotically selected because they look like your ex and hand-curated so that you don't get bored over coffee?

"(Jun 13, 2014  7:26 AM CDT) Four hundred miles beneath the United States, there appears to be enough water to fill all our oceans—almost three times. Researchers have for the first time discovered direct evidence of the water, which exists as a fourth form: not liquid, not ice, not vapor, but hydrogen and oxygen molecules trapped in a mineral called ringwoodite found in the transition zone, which sits between the upper and lower mantles, USA Today reports. Their findings follow up on the discovery, announced in March, of a water-rich sample of ringwoodite from the transition zone that was brought to the surface via a Brazilian volcano. That find  showed us at least one place there is water, but it didn't tell us how expansive the water would be,  explains Steve Jacobsen, one of the lead researchers. By analyzing how seismic waves moved at various depths, they found that  water is everywhere beneath North America,  New Scientist reports. To measure all of the United States took eight years, and the team wants to next determine whether the water-rich minerals extend around the whole planet, though doing so is reliant on the availability of seismometers in other regions.  Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades,  Jacobsen says, according to the Guardian; its existence was first theorized in 1987. The discovery could change our understanding of how the oceans formed: While some scientists have theorized the oceans' water came from a comet or asteroid, these findings suggest the oceans actually hail from water deep inside the planet that oozed out of rocks and was driven to the surface by geological activity in Earth's early days. The underground  reservoir  could hold three-quarters of the Earth's water.

It's at least the fifth such allegation against the former House speaker, who will soon be released from prison in a hush-money case, though previous accusers were in high school at the time of the alleged assaults. The suit was filed in a suburban Chicago court for a man using the pseudonym Richard Doe. It alleges Hastert abused him after the boy stopped during a bicycle ride to use the restroom in the summer of 1973 or 1974 in the Game Farm Building in Yorkville, Illinois. The location is now a parking lot for Yorkville High School, where Hastert was a high school wrestling coach, the Chicago Tribune reports. Doe alleges a man opened the door of the stall he was using and sodomized him. He says he saw the man's face but didn't know who he was. Doe alleges that changed a few weeks later when Hastert walked into him gym class at Yorkville Grade School, which is next to Yorkville High School. The suit, filed Friday in Kendall County Circuit Court, says Doe  was traumatized, repressed the sexual assault by Hastert, and was intimidated into silence.

It was a sign that the show  was not the best format for me,  the former talk show host tells the Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Tuesday. She says she left the show after her pronunciation of her name was viewed as  too emotional.  It was  a deja vu moment  that took her back to a time when as a young reporter she was told a story she'd written about a family who lost their home had  too much emotion.   I was working on pulling myself down and flattening out my personality—which, for me, is actually not such a good thing,  Winfrey said. Winfrey said her energy would instead be invested in a collaboration with Apple.  Maybe at some point there will be a regular series,  the 65-year-old teased.  Right now, I'd probably want to sit down and talk to Butta.  That's one of the names she has for Pete Buttigieg, aka  Buttabeep, Buttaboop.

"(May 10, 2014  1:54 PM CDT) Arkansas today issued its first gay-marriage licenses thanks to a rather bold deputy clerk in training, the Arkansas Times reports. The day after a judge struck down a state ban on gay marriage, about 50 couples arrived at the Eureka Springs courthouse this morning—and were told by the deputy county clerk that she wouldn't give out licenses because the county clerk was away. Apparently, she had called an attorney general for an opinion and, not hearing back, made the decision to shut down the courthouse, adds the Times. Police even asked everyone to leave. But minutes later, deputy clerk in training Jane Osborne reopened the doors and said she was  happy to do it.  The first to marry were Jennifer Rambo, 26, and Kristin Seaton, 27, who'd slept outside the courthouse overnight in their Ford Focus and woke up every half hour so they wouldn't miss the opening. Rambo's reaction when the license was issued, according to the AP:  Thank God.  Formidable forces had opposed them, including a state law banning same-sex marriage and a 2004 constitutional amendment that passed with 75% approval, Arkansas News notes. But  the fact that Amendment 83 was popular with voters does not protect it from constitutional scrutiny,  wrote county circuit judge Chris Piazza in his ruling.

Oracle had been seeking up to $1 billion in damages on copyright claims after alleging that Google Inc. built its popular Android mobile software by stealing some of the technology from Java, a programming platform that Oracle Corp. bought two years ago. In delivering a partial verdict today, the jury found that Google infringed on the largest of Oracle's claims, but it couldn't agree on whether Google's use was legally protected  fair use.  Without that determination, it will be difficult for Oracle to win major damages. The jury also found that Google infringed on Oracle's copyright on nine lines of Java code that is in Android, but Oracle can only go after statutory damages on that one.

The suit then claims that at an after-after-party in a hotel suite, Singer and Broadway producer Gary Goddard (who was also named in the first lawsuit) grabbed him sexually even after he asked them to stop. Doe says a third man smacked him around and then Singer tried to rape him. The suit also accuses Goddard of inappropriate acts when Doe was 15 or 16, including once plying Doe with alcohol and allegedly having anal sex with him. Singer and Goddard both deny the allegations, the Daily Beast reports. Interestingly, the age of consent in England is 16, but as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the lawsuit says California's age of consent (18) should apply since Singer and Goddard made their sexual plans while still in California.

The Witnesses' move to Warwick, a town about an hour north of New York City, will likely mean the end of the complex's most well-known feature, the neon  Watchtower  sign advertising the church's flagship publication. But it will free up hundreds of thousands of square feet for businesses and apartments in a now-trendy neighborhood at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.  It's going to be incredibly transformative,  says the executive director of the DUMBO Improvement District, a business group. The Witnesses bought their 733,000-square-foot headquarters from Squibb Pharmaceuticals for $3 million in 1969. It was placed on the market this month along with a nearby apartment building and a 135,000-square-foot lot.

According to a new study in Australia, parents with at least four children get the most satisfaction out of life despite the chaos and higher expenses, the Daily Signal reports.  With large families, we think they have social support within the family,  study lead Bronwyn Harman tells ABC News Australia.  The kids are never bored, they have someone to play with and they get independence quite early on.  She interviewed 950 parents over a 5-year period to evaluate their happiness level, Yahoo reports, and asked them about self-esteem, social support, and resilience. While parents with big families did have issues—like people asking if the kids had multiple fathers—they were still the most satisfied. Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but  they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate,  she says. Second-happiest (by a razor-thin margin of 0.25%) were LGBT parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, IVF, or adoption.  These children are not accidents ... so the child is very much desired,  says Harmon. The least happy in her still-unpublished study were single dads, who she says are often seen as lesser parents and struggle to play a role in their childrens' lives.  There is this perception that mothers are the real parents and fathers just sort of help,  Harmon tells the Sydney Morning Herald.

As the awards show opened, host Seth Meyers joked that if his stint as host at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association dinner had somehow prompted Donald Trump to run for president,  I just want to say: Oprah, you will never be president! You do not have what it takes.  He also not-asked Tom Hanks to be vice president, calling him  mean and unrelatable.  The crowd laughed, but then Winfrey dropped a bombshell speech as she accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award later in the evening—and that has now renewed whispers about the mega-star actually running, per the Washington Post. Winfrey has said in the past she would  never run for public office,  but she's given other hints she's not 100% against the prospect. The Post notes it's  no longer all that far-fetched to think that someone known primarily for their work on TV and with absolutely no governing experience could not only run for president but also win.  Per the AP, Twitter was abuzz after her speech Sunday, with comedian Sarah Silverman tweeting:  Oprah/Michelle 2020.  Winfrey's longtime beau and her best friend also weighed in.  I thought that speech was incredible. I got goosebumps,  BFF Gayle King told the Los Angeles Times, and Stedman Graham, who's been with Winfrey for decades, added:  It's up to the people. She would absolutely do it.  One other who thinks she's a winner: her potential rival.  Oprah will end up doing just fine with her network—she knows how to win,  Donald Trump tweeted in 2012.","After Golden Globes Speech, Talk of Oprah 2020 Builds","After Golden Globes Speech, Talk of Oprah ____ Builds",2020,Copy( 2020 ),0

Police say Terry Majors, 64, shot and killed his wife Leigh Shea-Majors, 61, and his 6-year-old grandson, Ty Dodson, before fatally shooting himself Saturday. Ty's 4-year-old sister ran to a neighbor's house for help and escaped unharmed, NBC News reports. She is now back home in Kentucky, where Ty had just started kindergarten little more than a month ago, with her mother, her mother's partner, and three older sisters. Of Majors, Ty's aunt tells the Tennessean,  He's always been as good as he could be. We never dreamed this could happen. It's just pure evil.  Adds a neighbor of the Majors to WKRN,  I know that they loved their grandkids very very much. ... I’m just as dumbfounded as everybody else is.  Majors had no significant criminal history in the county, and police were still investigating a possible motive. Ty's uncle, Chase Dodson, says the little boy visited the Majors often—it's unclear whether Terry Majors is the boy's grandfather, as he's often referred to in news articles on the case, or simply his grandmother's husband, as he is sometimes referred to, but in a Facebook fundraiser he set up for Ty's family, Chase Dodson writes,  My nephew Ty Dodson was visiting his grandparents on his moms side this past Saturday night in Tennessee. This visit went extremely wrong and the step-grandad murderd his wife, My nephew, and then cowardly turned the gun on himself.  Chase Dodson notes this is the latest in a series of tragedies for the family; Ty's biological father died just 15 days before Ty was born.","Man Kills Wife and Grandson, 6, During Grandkids' Visit: Police","Man Kills Wife and Grandson, ____, During Grandkids' Visit: Police",6,Copy( 6 ),0

"(Feb 3, 2014  4:03 PM) Archaeologists have excavated a 4,600-year-old pyramid in southern Egypt that was hidden under a pile of sand, waste, and its own remains, and come to a simple conclusion: They don't know what it's for. They do know the Edfu pyramid once stood 43 feet high and was brilliantly made in three blocks, LiveScience reports. It's also one of seven so-called  provincial  pyramids that may have been symbolic monuments affirming the king's power in those parts.  The similarities from one pyramid to the other are really amazing, and there is definitely a common plan,  says study leader Gregory Marouard. Supporting the royal-power theory, the researchers discovered an installation on the pyramid's east side that was apparently used for food offerings. But it seems the royals skipped off: By time Pharaoh Khufu came to power (2590-2563 BC), just 50 years after the pyramid was built, offerings weren't being made anymore and the pyramid had been abandoned. Khufu was focusing his resources on building the Great Pyramid at Giza, and may have felt his influence was assured in southern Egypt. The  center of gravity of Egypt was then at Memphis for many centuries—this region draining resources and manpower from the provinces,  writes Marouard.","4,600-Year-Old 'Mystery' Pyramid Excavated",____-Year-Old 'Mystery' Pyramid Excavated,"4,600","Copy( 4,600 )",0

Rowe was diagnosed with the virus in April 2015, and then embarked upon what the judge called a  determined hateful campaign of sly violence,  meeting men on gay dating app Grindr for sex. After they slept together, he would send them messages like  I have HIV LOL. Oops.  After having sex with eight men between October 2015 and February 2016, Rowe went on the run from police and had sex with two more men. He lied, telling the men he did not have the virus, but pressured them for unprotected sex or tampered with condoms if they refused, the Guardian reports.

Yue Chen, who also planned to kill himself, was angry the doctors had treated him like a  laboratory monkey,  according to a suicide note found by police, the Mercury News reports.

"(Apr 26, 2015  6:29 AM CDT) A tip for looking your best at age 145: Try replacing bits of your skin with plastic. That's what the experts in charge of preserving Vladimir Lenin's body have done, Scientific American reports. The Soviet Union founder, who died in 1924, would have turned 145 this week, and his mausoleum closed while the preservation team made improvements to his embalmed body. Their primary goal is maintaining the body's look and feel rather than its original material, Scientific American notes:  They have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials, so in terms of the original biological matter, the body is less and less of what it used to be,  says an expert. That sets the work apart from processes like mummification, he notes,  where the focus was on preserving the original matter while the form of the body changes.  Now, in addition to the skin replacements, Lenin has false eyelashes, and instead of skin fat, researchers have molded a combination of chemicals to keep his skin looking the same. The body is re-embalmed using a bath of chemicals in alternate years. Lenin has kept scientists busy: During the period between the 1950s and 1980s, as many as 200 experts had jobs maintaining the body, Scientific American notes. Meanwhile, the image of Lenin remains a potent symbol, as two statues of the leader in eastern Ukraine were knocked down last week in protest of Russia, AFP reports.

"(Sep 20, 2017  10:05 AM CDT) Feathers, wishbones, colored eggs. If they're things you associate as only found in birds, you're wrong, says paleontologist Mark Norell. It turns out dinosaurs evolved all three, though we've only just recently learned about that last item. The discovery of fossil egg-shells in China has upended the conventional wisdom that all dino eggs were white, a belief born out of the fact that, as National Geographic reports, lizard, turtle, and crocodile eggs are white. But as a study newly published in Peer J explains, researchers now believe that a species of oviraptor named Heyuannia huangi laid blue-green eggs. While fossil eggs often end up looking brown or black, the 67 million-year-old ones found in China seemed blueish, which led scientists to try—and, as it turns out, succeed—to identify bits of colored pigments. The two, biliverdin (blue) and protoporphyrin (red), are typically found in today's bird eggs, and the researchers speculate that the coloring may have worked as a protective camouflage.  It was a huge surprise. I couldn't believe it,  says co-author Jasmina Wiemann. The findings suggest the dinosaurs were at least partially open nesting, as  colored eggs are present in most modern birds which build open nests, as the eggs are vulnerable due to periods without parental guarding.  A 2015 report from CBS News on the initial findings shares another hypothesis: that male oviraptors may have provided care for the eggs, as is the case among their colored-egg modern bird counterparts.

Prorodatcylus walked on four legs, was about the size of a house cat, and lived in the shadow of its  more diverse, successful, and abundant crocodile-like cousins  for millions of years, according to the researchers. The discovery means that dinosaurs emerged some 9 million years earlier than had previously been believed, say the scientists. The footprints prove that dinosaurs arose just 2 million years after the Permian extinction wiped out over 90% of life on Earth, the researchers say, indicating that the rise of the dinosaurs is directly related to the extinction.

"(Jun 2, 2015  2:33 AM CDT) In 1933, promising young Jewish-German violinist Ernest Drucker left the stage midway through a Brahms concerto in Cologne at the behest of Nazi officials, in one of the first anti-Semitic acts of the regime. More than 80 years later, his son, Grammy-winning American violinist Eugene Drucker, has completed his father's interrupted work. With tears in his eyes, Drucker performed an emotional rendition of the Brahms Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 77, over the weekend with the Raanana Symphonette Orchestra in Israel.  I think he would feel a sense of completion. I think in some ways many aspects of my career served that purpose for him,  the 63-year-old Drucker said of his father, who passed away in 1993.  There is all this emotional energy and intensity loaded into my associations to this piece.  Thursday's concert, and a second performance Sunday night, commemorated the Judischer Kulturbund—a federation of Jewish musicians in Nazi Germany who were segregated so as not to  sully  Aryan culture. After the humiliation in Cologne, the elder Drucker became a central player in the Kulturbund—to which, initially, the Nazi culture ministry granted relative freedom, so long as its performers and audiences were exclusively Jewish. As the years progressed, however, and the Nazi ideology took deeper root, greater restrictions were imposed until eventually they could only perform Jewish works, with Bach and Beethoven off-limits. The Kulturbund was reduced significantly after the pogroms of Kristallnacht in 1938. Musicians went underground or fled, like Drucker's father, who went to America.

"(Mar 10, 2015  1:50 PM CDT) The US is the only country out of 38 that doesn't require paid maternity leave, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. And while the US Family and Medical Leave Act does provide for up to 12 weeks of leave for some employees with a new baby or other qualifying family situation, it's unpaid leave. A global telecom company, however, has decided it's not waiting for mandates from each of its affiliate nations, including the US: Vodafone will offer 16 paid weeks of maternity leave, covering new moms in the US, Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, and Europe, CBS News reports. And once moms are back behind the desk, the company takes its progressive policy one step further, paying a mother's full salary for a 30-hour workweek for the first six months. The changes will be implemented by the end of 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. KPMG research commissioned by Vodafone estimated that businesses offering 16 paid weeks would dole out $28 billion a year globally for the benefits. But it also found that by saving $47 billion by not having to recruit and train new employees taking over for moms opting out of the workforce, companies would save $19 billion a year collectively. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao also thinks that since fewer moms will permanently off-ramp, his company can boost more women who work there (35% of its employees) into upper-management roles—only 21% of its international upper ranks are currently made up of women.

He was 91. Throughout his rule, he was a stalwart US ally, a bulwark against Islamic militancy, and guardian of Egypt's peace with Israel, per the AP. But to the tens of thousands of young Egyptians who rallied for 18 days of unprecedented street protests in Cairo's central Tahrir Square and elsewhere in 2011, Mubarak was a relic, a latter-day pharaoh. They harnessed the power of social media to muster tumultuous throngs, unleashing popular anger over the graft and brutality that shadowed his rule. In the end, with millions massed in Cairo's Tahrir Square and city centers around the country and even marching to the doorstep of Mubarak's palace, the military that long nurtured him pushed him aside on Feb. 11, 2011. The generals took power, hoping to preserve what they could of the system he headed. Though Tunisia's president fell before him, the ouster of Mubarak was the more stunning collapse in the face of the Arab Spring shaking regimes across the Arab world.

It’s not a public-service job, nor should it pay like one.  As one analyst tactfully put it,  You’re going to get a different variety of folks who are going to come in.  Translation: Only a lousy executive is going to work for $500,000. Obama is  swept up in the public-relations tantrum  over bonuses.

"(Mar 8, 2016  8:11 AM) For Wall Street bankers, 2015 didn't turn out as well as it usually does in terms of bonuses. Per Bloomberg, the average bonus fell 9% last year to $146,200, which is the largest decrease since 2011, according to estimates by NYS Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. As the Washington Post notes, 2015's bonuses were larger than those during the Great Recession, but smaller than those in 2006, which saw a record-high average of $191,360. The Post also speculates that 2016 isn't going to improve much on that, with state officials anticipating a decline in the overall bonus pool—last year's was $25 billion—of about 2.5% this fiscal year.  Wall Street bonuses and profits fell in 2015, reflecting a challenging year in the financial markets,  DiNapoli says in a press release.  While the cost of legal settlements appears to be easing, ongoing weaknesses in the global economy and market volatility may dampen profits in 2016.

"(Dec 20, 2015  2:45 PM) It is one of the most unusual, and rarest, jobs in the country: Larry Villarin is a certified male sex surrogate, one of only 10 in the US sanctioned by the International Professional Surrogates Association. But as a profile at Broadly makes clear, the 62-year-old Villarin is not to be confused with a male gigolo. His role is to help clients  cope with their fears and anxieties about physical intimacy,  writes Natalie O'Neill, and sex is just one component of that. The story uses the example of a 35-year-old woman who had shied away from intimacy her entire adult life because a car accident as a teenager left her blind in one eye. She'd never even been kissed until her sessions with Villarin.  She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away,  he says.  It was beautiful to see her open up.  On its website, IPSA says  it is committed to promoting healthy attitudes toward sexuality and intimacy in our clients and in the community,  and the story explains that it gets around prostitution laws  because it doesn't acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice.  Villarin says his clients range in age from 22 to 75, with milestone birthdays seemingly one of the big triggers. Most are referred to him from a psychologist, with survivors of abuse and women with disabilities among those reaching out. One of the tricky parts is setting boundaries so the clients don't confuse the physical intimacy with romantic feelings for Villarin.  It's just growth—what humans are capable of,  he says.

"(Aug 3, 2017  9:36 AM CDT) A Virginia man has been arrested and charged with abduction after law enforcement went to a home and found a woman and two children who'd allegedly been held against their will for two years. Fredericksburg.com reports that the break in the case came Saturday, when sheriff's deputies went to a Spotsylvania County home after receiving a tip from a concerned caller, who noted no one had seen the family members in some time. A man greeted the deputies but seemed  reluctant  to speak with them, and as that stilted conversation was taking place, a 32-year-old woman and two kids, ages 8 and 11, dashed out a side door and toward the safety of other deputies, who heard from the trio that they hadn't been allowed to leave the house for at least two years. Kariem Ali Muhammad Moore, 43, was arrested for abduction and assault and battery; he's believed to be the boyfriend of the woman and the father of her two kids, per NBC Washington. Investigators looking into the allegations say it doesn't appear the family was physically restrained or caged, but every window and door at the home was reportedly shrouded with blankets and other coverings. The kids apparently did not attend school during the alleged captivity. A sheriff's office rep says the woman was hospitalized due to unattended-to medical issues and is in serious condition; the kids were checked out and released to family. The sheriff's office says no missing persons report was on the books. Moore is being held without bond in Rappahannock Regional Jail.

"(Jul 4, 2014  5:30 AM CDT) With US student debt at a staggering $1.2 trillion—including an average $30K each for member of the class of 2012—Indiana University has set an example a lot of places could learn from. The seven-campus system managed to slash student debt by far more than the national average with a simple letter that it began sending in the 2012-2013 school year. Sent out largely via email in advance of students taking loans for the subsequent year, the letter let them know what their monthly payment would be after graduation, Bloomberg finds. In the 9 months ending March 31, Federal Stafford loan disbursements to the university dropped 11%, or $31 million, compared to the year prior. The national average for the same period was a 2% drop.  We are having more contact with the student where they can say 'I don't want this,' or 'I want less,'  says the Indiana system's director of financial aid.  If they know at all times their debt, and the repayment, it helps with a lot of planning.  The letters, he says, are part of an effort to boost students'  financial literacy  with far more advice offered than that required under federal law, which only requires counseling at the beginning and end of studies.

Or so its demise was believed: The initiative—which embedded social scientists with combat units to help them avoid pointless battles and boost local aid efforts, and which cost $725 million since 2007—was apparently never shut down at all, yet the Army seemed content to let it appear as if it were, according to Army files and an anonymous DoD official. One person outraged about this development: California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the Armed Services Committee who calls the revelation  absolutely astonishing.   Even if … the program was never killed, the Army was happy with members of Congress and the scientific community thinking and believing it was killed,  he says.  The Army is evidently OK with taking people for fools.  Other issues the program was plagued by: commanders who didn't take scientist recommendations seriously and a condemnation from the American Anthropological Association. In 2015, the Army said the program had been shut down the previous year, noting there  was no longer a requirement for HTS teams in theater.  But a look at Army documents by USA Today found the focus of the program had simply changed from experts in the field to those based at Kansas' Fort Leavenworth, and it rebranded itself the Global Cultural Knowledge Network. Plus there's a paper trail showing Leavenworth officials wanted critics (including Hunter) to think the program had been killed, including a memo with instructions on how to handle  Evil People Questions  about the program.

Inside were 116 small bombs, and each bomb was filled with needles and shrapnel,  he recalls.  My son had to carry the pieces of his mother and sister out of the house,  he says; the boy was 14 at the time. Shrapnel wounded another daughter.

The strip of plastic mesh is used to help with urinary incontinence and to lift organs that shift post-pregnancy, and it's meant to remain in place for life. But doctors who have removed the mesh from women's bodies tell CBS News the devices come out shrunken and contracted, and experts say that the type of plastic used, polypropylene, disintegrates over time. Boston Scientific, which makes the mesh, originally got its plastic (called Marlex) from a subsidiary of Chevron Phillips, but after Chevron Phillips became concerned about implanting Marlex in the human body, it stopped selling it to Boston Scientific in 2005. Boston Scientific ultimately turned to China for a replacement—and a plastic expert tells CBS it is even worse than the one originally used. Though evidence mounted that the product from China was a counterfeit version of Marlex, with testing showing it was different from the original version used, Boston Scientific officially concluded it was the same material and started using it. Experts who looked at the Chinese product say they would only expect it to last inside the body a few months, not permanently. And women who spoke to CBS News report horrifying experiences with the mesh, with one saying she could no longer feel when her bladder was full and often had blood in her urine and another saying it felt like there was a cheese grater inside her body. Experts say the supply chain of the plastic is not clear and that the lack of documentation and testing on the product is a huge concern:  Implantation of this into anyone is human experimentation but without consent,  says one surgeon.

But the agency is planning for that possibility and increasing its monitoring, per the Wall Street Journal.  This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,  Nancy Messonnier said. Seven of the US cases are in California, with one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. The 13th case, in Humboldt County, California, was confirmed Friday. Other Americans are seriously ill in hospitals in Japan, Messonnier said.","US Reports 34 Coronavirus Cases, With More Likely","US Reports ____ Coronavirus Cases, With More Likely",34,Copy( 34 ),0
"(Jun 15, 2017  12:57 PM CDT) Seven people were killed and 59 injured in an explosion Thursday at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China as relatives were picking up their children at the end of the school day, local officials said. The blast at the Chuangxin Kindergarten in Fengxian, which struck at 4:50pm, was under investigation, the Xuzhou city government in Jiangsu province said on its microblog. It wasn't immediately clear whether the explosion was deliberately set or the result of an accident, the AP reports. The official newspaper Global Times reported on its website that the incident was caused by the explosion of a gas cylinder at a roadside food stall, citing a witness identified only by the surname Shi. The blast sent people flying several yards into the air, Shi was quoted as saying. Kindergartens in China have been targeted before in apparent revenge attacks carried out by mentally ill people or those bearing grudges against their neighbors and society. Videos purportedly from the scene and posted on social media showed children and adults lying on the ground, some bleeding. Clothing, shoes, and other items were strewn on the ground beside pools of blood. The videos showed ambulances arriving and medics wheeling people into an emergency room. The Xuzhou government said two people died at the scene and five others died at a hospital. At least four others were seriously injured, it said. China maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes, or homemade explosives.",7 Dead in Explosion at China Kindergarten,____ Dead in Explosion at China Kindergarten,7,Trans( Seven ),1

The government is the only source of pot for nearly all research in the US, while it still considers it illegal and dangerous. Scientists have asked for weed that more closely matches what's sold in states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, the National Institute on Drug Abuse said in an email to the AP.

The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, and three out of four stocks in the index sank. But the market’s losses would have been much worse if not for continued gains for technology stocks. Momentum for Microsoft, Apple, and other tech stocks has proven to be nearly unstoppable this year, even in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, and more gains for them almost singlehandedly kept Wall Street steady for much of Wednesday’s trading. The S&P 500 wavered between modest gains and losses for much of the day before it turned lower in the last half hour, ending down 20.02 points at 2,848.42.

Romney, after all, wasn't talking about his tax bracket, but his effective tax rate, meaning what percentage of his income he actually winds up paying, USA Today points out. The average American's effective federal tax rate is just 11%, according to 2009 IRS data, and if you make less than $50,000, that falls to 5%. Yes, that's low—taxes are at a 40-year nadir, David Leonhardt of the New York Times points out. But most people think taxes are high, both because of weak wage growth and because they  sense, and not incorrectly, that others are benefiting from tax breaks unavailable to them,  he writes. The wealthy have seen their taxes fall the most, and they also benefit more from deductions. And then there's the fact that capital gains—which likely make up most of Romney's income—are only taxed at 15%, a part of the tax code that  favors assets over wages,  writes Jared Bernstein in the Christian Science Monitor.

The city undertook a surprise overnight operation to remove them, with crews starting about 11:30pm and working until the early morning, reports the Baltimore Sun. (See video.)  They needed to come down,  says Mayor Catherine Pugh.  My concern is for the safety and security of our people. We moved as quickly as we could.  Overshadowing the move, of course, is the violence in Charlottesville, Va., that revolved around the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee. One of the statues that came down in Baltimore was of Lee with fellow Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. It had stood in a city park since 1948, notes the New York Times. Also coming down was a Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, another honoring Confederate women, and one in tribute to former Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 decreeing that even free blacks had no right to citizenship. Pugh said the city is still figuring out where the statues will end up. In North Carolina, meanwhile, a 22-year-old woman who helped topple a Confederate statue faces felony charges, reports the Herald Sun. Takiyah Thompson admits she climbed a ladder and tied a rope to the statue of a Confederate soldier so it could be pulled down.

The airline issued a report Thursday detailing 10 changes it is making after the Chicago incident earlier this month, reports the Washington Post. United's report says its mistakes on April 9, when 69-year-old David Dao was dragged out of his seat by aviation police, included trying to make space for off-duty crew members at the last minute by bumping passengers involuntarily, only offering $800 in compensation to try to persuade people to give up their seats, and calling police when Dao refused to get off the plane. In a statement, United CEO Oscar Munoz described the incident as a  turning point  and the start of a shift toward becoming a  better, more customer-focused airline.  Reuters reports that other changes announced by United include a  no questions asked  policy on bags it permanently loses, for which passengers will be paid $1,500 starting in June.

Australian researchers have found that a drug made using venom from ocean-dwelling cone snails may be 100 times as powerful as top painkillers morphine and gabapentin, which are currently used to ease chronic nerve pain born from injury, cancer, diabetes, and other diseases, AFP reports. What's more, the drug, based on peptides called conotoxins that reside in the snails' venom, is thought not to have the addictive properties of other painkillers, the Sydney Morning Herald notes. So far, though, the drug has been tested only on rats.  We don't know about side effects yet, as it hasn't been tested in humans. But we think it would be safe,  says lead researcher David Craik. A test on people is at least two years off, he notes; still, the finding could lead to a  whole new class of drugs capable of relieving one of the most severe forms of chronic pain that is currently very difficult to treat —and one taken orally. Another drug made from conotoxin is already approved for use on humans, but it requires spinal cord injection.

A climber sheltering from the rain happened upon four coins in Dovedale, Derbyshire, reports the Ashbourne News Telegraph, which led to a National Trust excavation of the site, called Reynard’s Cave. And what exactly did they find? A trove of 26 Roman and Late Iron Age coins and 20 Late Iron Age gold and silver pieces that may have belonged to the Corieltavi Tribe; three of the Roman coins pre-date the 43 AD invasion of Britain, reports the BBC. The discovery is a triple mystery: Roman coins have never been found in a cave, coins from these two civilizations have never been buried together, and the Corieltavi have long been thought to have occupied areas further east during the Late Iron Age. The stash was possibly hidden in a cave for protection; Late Iron Age coins were largely symbols of power and status, rather than used to buy goods. However, it's possible the coins' owner squirreled away his  best stuff,  or was awaiting an increase in their value, speculates one archeologist on the dig. The project proved exciting for one participant—a military vet involved in the excavation as part of a rehabilitation program.  I was working at the back of the cave, in the dark, and I was the first person to find a coin—a silver coin. It was so exciting,  she tells the Telegraph.

The Kansas City Star reports on the 39-year-old's indictment for second-degree murder, almost seven months after his 20-year-old son Dominick J. Pittsenbarger passed away. Per the New York Post, the Clay County jury that handed down the indictment Tuesday believes injuries from the February 1998 attack on baby Dominick—in which Tannery is said to have squeezed, shaken, and thrown the month-old infant to the ground in an effort to stop his crying—ultimately led to Dominick's death in April. Doctors didn't initially think the baby would survive the attack, but he did, although he was left with broken ribs, a fractured vertebra, bleeding on the brain, and other head injuries. He was left severely brain damaged and used a wheelchair for his entire life. Tannery pleaded guilty to a first-degree assault charge in 1999 and was sentenced to 13 years in prison; he was released in 2007.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for today's bloodshed, but the attacks bore the hallmarks of al-Qaeda's Iraqi arm. The group, known as the Islamic State of Iraq, frequently uses car bombs and coordinated blasts in an effort to undermine Iraqis' confidence in the Shiite-led government. The blasts are the latest indication that Iraq's security is rapidly deteriorating as sectarian tensions exacerbated by months of Sunni-led anti-government protests and the war in neighboring Syria are on the rise. Although violence has decreased sharply in Iraq since the height of insurgency, militants are still capable to carry out lethal attacks nationwide. The recent wave of bloodshed has raised tensions between the country's Sunni minority and Shiite-led government. The surge in violence has been reminiscent of the sectarian carnage that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007.

The nonbinding measure, introduced by Reps. Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Louie Gohmert, would put the House on record as believing Mueller should resign because he's unfit to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Politico reports. Why? Due to  obvious conflicts of interest,  including his relationship with James Comey, who succeeded him at the FBI and was later ousted from his post by President Trump; among other things, Mueller is investigating whether anyone in the Trump administration obstructed justice during that ouster. Per Fox News, the measure also makes note of Mueller's supervision of a bribery probe when he was FBI director that involved a Russian nuclear-energy company that got approval from US government agencies to buy a Canadian energy company that had mining operations in the US.  Evidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and from the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies,  Gaetz said in a statement wondering how the deal got US approval despite the bribery probe. The representatives say that's another reason Mueller should recuse himself as special counsel, as his  impartiality is hopelessly compromised.

We know where the good effects of alcohol are mediated in the brain, and can mimic them,  he says.  And by not touching the bad areas, we don't have the bad effects.  A nontoxic alcohol that doesn't let drinkers get blotto could save a lot of money, Time reports. The CDC estimated that over-consumption of alcohol cost US taxpayers up to $223.5 billion in 2006.

"(Nov 22, 2018  10:30 AM) Congratulations, you've lived to see a planet transformed back to the Pliocene Epoch, at least in terms of greenhouse gas levels.  The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,  says the UN's World Meteorological Organization after its annual assessment found concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbed 0.5% last year to record levels; those levels of carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, are 41% higher than in 1990, per Bloomberg. That's a level last seen 3 million to 5 million years ago, when the global temperature was several degrees warmer and sea levels were up to 66 feet higher than today.  Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth,  WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas says. Contributing to violent weather events and the melting of ice caps, CO2 concentrations rose from an average of 403.3 parts per million in 2016 to 405.5 parts per million in 2017, reports New Scientist. Levels of methane, at 2.5 times the pre-industrial mark, and nitrous oxide, over 20% higher than the pre-industrial mark, also rose, per the Guardian, while WMO reported a resurgence of trichlorofluoromethane, a banned chemical tied to ozone depletion.  I am very concerned,  a climate researcher tells the Guardian.  It seems the urgency and extent of the actions needed to address climate change have not sunk in.  Per Bloomberg, the report will  add to pressure  on representatives from almost 200 countries who will meet to discuss climate change responses in Poland next month.

While 64% of Americans are aware that incandescents are being phased out, only 4 in 10 know that the bell tolls for the last two varieties, 40- and 60-watt bulbs, in 2014, according to the latest Sylvania Socket Survey. The 100W and 75W varieties were phased out in 2012 and 2013, respectively. But the survey also found that most Americans won't be in mourning; 59% said they were  excited  about the phase out, which will see Americans switching to more efficient bulbs. Thirty percent, however, say they intend to stock up on incandescents while they can: Though production ends Wednesday, the supply isn't expected to run out until mid-2014.

Vescovo, a 53-year-old private equity investor from Texas, has become the first person to visit the deepest spots in all five of the world's oceans; that includes the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot on the planet, the BBC reports. His dives in the DSV Limiting Factor, a prototype deep-diving submersible launched from the DSSV Pressure Drop, also included a visit to the wreck of the Titanic. The team says the 10-month-long  Five Deeps Expedition  discovered at least 40 new species and collected bottom-water samples for scientific analysis. The Five Deeps team also mapped tens of thousands of square miles of the ocean floor. Vescovo is now seeking a buyer for the DSV Limiting Factor, which he commissioned from Florida company Triton Submarines. The expedition involved a total of around 40 dives, but Triton Submarines president Patrick Lahey tells Popular Science that it's  built for thousands of dives over decades.  Vescovo says the deep sea has long been  this big impenetrable mystery.  But with the new vehicle, he says,  we feel like we have just created, validated, and opened a powerful door to discover and visit any place, any time, in the ocean—which is 90% unexplored.

Its own president has, when he tried visiting the Louvre as a tourist, the New York Times reports. Now, Jean-Luc Martinez is working to make the museum more visitor-friendly—and tougher to get lost in. He's reorganizing its overwhelming reception area, adding two more entrances to try to pare down those lines, and working to improve the way the Louvre informs visitors about its works. The project, which will cost some $67 million, involves improving on the 40,000 banners and other displays discussing each piece in French. Museums have in the past tended to target visitors who already know a lot about art history, notes Martinez, who says the redone signage will be briefer—and also offered in English and Spanish.  For nearly everybody, museums are scary spaces,  says an expert.  It’s like going into the city for the first time.  But Martinez, born to a postman in a working-class suburb rather than hailing from the wealthy world of his predecessors, is working to change that.  Our museum is not a book,  organized into  chapters  and  paragraphs,  he notes.  It’s something physical. It’s necessary to move things around to try to increase understanding of our art.  The effort could  take decades,  he has said, according to artnet.

The racket that Serena Williams threw down onto the court in September 2018 during a US Open final match against Naomi Osaka is up for sale via Goldin Auctions, and while the opening bid is set at just $2,000, founder Ken Goldin thinks it'll bring in at least $10,000, and perhaps as much as $50,000, he tells the New York Times. The incident that led to the racket's untimely demise was Williams' clash with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, which, combined with a playing violation, brought her a $17,000 fine and jump-started a debate over sexism and racism in the tennis industry. The racket took a nonlinear path to Goldin.

"(Jul 15, 2015  8:20 AM CDT) On Amber Scorah's first day back at work after maternity leave, she dropped her 3-month-old son off at the SoHo daycare that she and Lee Towndrow had chosen for him. Hours later, son Karl was dead. New York City's medical examiner's office yesterday performed an autopsy on the child, who, according to the owner of the unlicensed daycare, never woke from a nap. No obvious signs of trauma had been noted, and a cause of death has yet to be determined. The New York Daily News spoke with law enforcement sources who shared this timeline: Owner Maryellen Strautmanis reportedly gave Karl a bottle of breast milk around 10:30am; he was fussy, and she put him in a bassinet around 11:45am. By noon, he was quiet, but roughly 10 minutes later Strautmanis allegedly noticed his lips were blue. Those sources tell the Daily News neither Strautmanis nor her three employees were trained in CPR. But the New York Times describes SoHo Child Care in terms that don't make it sound shoddy: It reportedly provided organic meals and Spanish immersion, and the woman at the helm of it for the last 14 years had herself raised six kids. Her daycare, which had been caring for 15 children, was yesterday shut down by the city. The Times points out that those working in licensed facilities must undergo training in CPR and preventing sudden infant death syndrome. A GoFundMe page set up by friends and family to assist with funeral expenses reads  Karl was beloved by his parents, who doted on him every moment.  Scorah, 41, is a writer who works for Scholastic; Towndrow, 40, is a cinematographer who worked on the HBO Scientology documentary Going Clear. They released a statement via a friend that asks  for privacy as they grieve [Karl's] short, wonderful life.

Isabel Martinez, 33, appeared before Gwinnett County Magistrate Judge Michael Thorpe a day after police said she stabbed the five to death and seriously injured another child at her home outside Atlanta, per the AP. The injured child, a 9-year-old girl, survived but remains hospitalized with injuries police described as serious. Before the hearing began, Martinez sat with other inmates and struck poses for cameras—smiling, giving a double thumbs up, putting her hands in a prayer position, and spreading her arms out wide. As Judge Thorpe listed the charges she faces—five counts of malice murder, five counts of murder, and six counts of aggravated assault—Martinez smiled, shook her head  no , and wagged her finger at him. The judge advised her sharply not to perform for the cameras. When the judge informed her of her right to have an attorney, she said through a Spanish-language interpreter that she doesn't want one. She later added that her attorney will always be the people and her faith. Thorpe advised Martinez to hire a lawyer or to allow one to be appointed for her. The four children killed were identified as Isabela Martinez, 10; Dacota Romero, 7; Dillan Romero, 4; and Axel Romero, 2.

"(Mar 7, 2019  10:25 AM) The headline of an op-ed published by Bloomberg reads  Stop Listening to Michael Jackson.  The piece by Ramesh Ponnuru is exactly what Jackson's estate had been hoping to avoid following HBO's Leaving Neverland documentary, in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim Jackson sexually abused them as children. Having made $2.1 billion since Jackson's 2009 death—consider the film This Is It, two Cirque du Soleil tribute shows, a forthcoming Broadway musical, and the $250 million Sony paid in 2018 for the rights to Jackson's music over seven years—the estate has plenty to lose should fans turn their backs on the megastar, per the Guardian and Washington Post. One music industry expert tells the Guardian its revenues will almost certainly suffer in the short term, but the long-term prognosis  comes down to the consumer.  Hence why Jackson's estate is on a PR blitz. Not only did it file a $100 million lawsuit against HBO, with lawyers calling the documentary  a one-sided marathon of unvetted propaganda to shamelessly exploit an innocent man,  but it released two concert films on YouTube to compete with the premiere. Then there are the bus ads that have appeared in the UK, where the second part of the documentary is to air Thursday.  Facts don't lie. People do,  the ads read, per the Post. Still, various radio stations in Canada and New Zealand have stopped playing Jackson's music, citing a change in public opinion. Sony's investment might still pay off, however. Per CNBC, there was a 116% increase in US streams of R. Kelly's music in the days after Lifetime aired a documentary in which several women accused the singer of abuse.

"(Jun 21, 2017  12:24 AM CDT) The severity of America's opioid epidemic was captured in a dire government report published Tuesday. According to the report, released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the rate of opioid-related emergency room visits nearly doubled between 2005 and 2014, increasing a whopping 99%. The report also found the rate of opioid-related inpatient hospital stays increased 64% during that time. All told, American hospitals reported 1.27 million opioid-related visits in 2014, about 3,500 per day. The report also states that women have closed the gender gap when it comes to opioid-related hospital visits. In 2005 the rate of male inpatient stays was considerably higher than the rate for women, but by 2014 the rate was the same, though men are still more likely to be treated in hospital emergency departments for opioid-related issues. Though the opioid epidemic is a countrywide problem, the AHRQ report finds that the problem is considerably worse in certain states. Maryland ranked at the top of the list of states for emergency visits in 2014, while Massachusetts saw the most inpatient stays. The Washington Post reports that Maryland is already suffering high rates of heroin and prescription-opioid overdoses. The number of opioid-related deaths in the state has nearly quadrupled since 2010 and the governor declared a state of emergency earlier this year. That increase can be blamed partially on the spread of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. One expert tells the Huffington Post the AHRQ data comes as  no surprise,  noting that overdose deaths are  just the tip of the iceberg  in the US.

Charlene Thomas, who was 65 when she died, was 41 years old when she was attacked in her home by then-23-year-old Eric Shaw. He was sentenced to a maximum of 18 years in prison for attempted murder and sodomy but served additional time because of prison contraband offenses and state inmate records show that he was released on parole in March of 2015, reports the New York Daily News.

"(Apr 13, 2011  1:12 PM CDT) Tough new details are emerging in the story of the 25-year-old mother who killed herself and three of her children by driving a minivan into the Hudson River. It turns out that the lone survivor, 10-year-old Lashaun Armstrong, escaped by opening a power window and climbing out after his mother drove into the water, reports the AP. Earlier reports suggested Lashanda Armstrong had let the child out. Lashaun then swam to a boat ramp, turned around to look for the vehicle,  and it was gone,  say police. A passerby stopped and drove him to a nearby firehouse, reports the Daily News. Rescuers had no chance of saving Armstrong; Landon Pierre, 5; Lance Pierre, 2; and 11-month-old Lainaina Pierre. Armstrong reportedly had an earlier argument with live-in boyfriend Jean Pierre, father of the three dead children.  We're talking about a tragedy in this city that is second to none,  said Newburgh Mayor Nick Valentine.","Boy, 10, Escaped Hudson Mom's Van by Window","Boy, ____, Escaped Hudson Mom's Van by Window",10,Copy( 10 ),0

The Jeddah Tower has already been built to the 26th floor, but there are many more to go; ultimately, the tower will boast 200 floors and stretch a full kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky. The Jeddah Economic Company has signed a $2.2 billion financing deal with Alinma Investment to complete the tower and the surrounding Jeddah City, CNN reports. Upon completion, planned for 2020, it will break the record for the world's tallest building currently held by the 2,716-foot-tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The tower, which will overlook the Red Sea, requires 200-foot-deep foundations in order to ensure the saltwater doesn't damage them. The tower will also change shape every few floors so that the wind won't buffet the building as badly as it would a solid block, one of the architects on the project explained to Construction Weekly in 2011. It will require 80,000 tons of steel and 5.7 million square feet of concrete.",Saudi Arabia: We'll Have World's Tallest Building by 2020,Saudi Arabia: We'll Have World's Tallest Building by ____,2020,Copy( 2020 ),0

The report by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the killings and injuries were among 11,779 grave violations against children during the period between April 1, 2013, and Dec. 31, 2018. It said the figures are likely to be worse because monitoring Yemen has become increasingly difficult, the AP reports.

Researchers at the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimate that the B117 variant, which carries a set of 23 mutations, is 56% more transmissible than other strains, Bloomberg reports. They say that while there is no sign B117 is deadlier than other strains of COVID-19, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are likely to surge unless the British government takes steps including closing schools and increasing the vaccination rate tenfold from the current 200,000 a week. Britain's Office for National Statistics said Friday that there has been a sharp rise in positive tests in London and the southeast of England, where the variant was first detected, the BBC reports. The ONS estimates two-thirds of people testing positive in the region could have the new variant. The variant has also been detected in countries including Denmark and Singapore, which reported its first B117 case Friday.  Unfortunately, this is another twist in the plot,  Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, tells the New York Times.

Greenglass—who admitted decades later that he lied on the stand about his own sister—died in New York City on July 1, according to the Rosenbergs' sons. After his release from prison in 1960, Greenglass lived under an assumed name in Queens. The Rosenbergs were convicted in 1951 of conspiring to steal secrets about the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union and were executed at New York's Sing Sing prison, insisting to the very end that they were innocent. Greenglass, indicted as a co-conspirator, testified that he had given the Rosenbergs data obtained through his wartime job as an Army machinist at Los Alamos, headquarters of the project to build the atomic bomb. He told of seeing his sister transcribing the information on a typewriter at the Rosenbergs' New York apartment in 1945. That testimony proved crucial in convicting Ethel and her husband. In 2001, Greenglass was quoted in the book The Brother by New York Times reporter Sam Roberts as saying he had not actually seen Ethel typing and knew of it only from his wife.

Instead, it praised them for  selflessly  serving the poor and asked the nuns themselves to assess their own challenges amid declining numbers, reports the Catholic News Service.

Niels Hoegel, 40, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 for those crimes, but prosecutors voiced their belief that the nurse had killed many more while working at clinics in Oldenburg (from 1999 to 2002) and Delmenhorst (from 2003 to 2005), reports the AP. Now police are giving a sense of just how many more: at least 84. Hoegel said at trial that he wanted to play the hero and drugged his patients so that he could then resuscitate them and win praise. Except a commission established three years ago to determine the breadth of his crimes has found that many patients ended up receiving lethal doses of drugs that brought on heart failure or destroyed the circulatory system. The BBC reports that 134 bodies have been exhumed and tested for traces of the drug, but  it is simply not possible to say how many people were killed,  per Oldenburg police chief Johann Kuhme. That's in part because many of his patients were cremated. The AFP quotes chief police investigator Arne Schmidt as describing the death toll as  unique in the history of the German republic.  There is  evidence for at least 90 murders,  he said at a press conference,  and at least as many [suspected] cases again that can no longer be proven.  Kuhme faulted the clinics for having  hesitated to alert authorities,  saying the death toll could have been much lower if they had. New charges against Hoegel will likely be filed next year.

"(Sep 27, 2014  1:29 PM CDT) Apple says its latest iPhone has an encryption system that will keep users' emails and photos safe from the prying eyes of the NSA or any law-enforcement agency, reports the New York Times. The company says its algorithm is so complex that if it ever had to turn over data from an iPhone 6, it would take the NSA about five years to decode it. Even if Apple is underestimating the NSA's abilities, the principle isn't sitting well with FBI chief James Comey.  What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law,  he says. Comey cited the example of a kidnapping in which parents come to him  with tears in their eyes  and say,  'What do you mean you can't?'  The Times report also quotes security officials who predict terrorists will quickly embrace such technology, along with a tech expert who says law-enforcement concerns are being exaggerated. In an earlier piece on the encryption by Matthew Green at Slate, Green says Apple isn't picking a fight with the government.  Apple is not designing systems to prevent law enforcement from executing legitimate warrants,  he writes.  It’s building systems that prevent everyone who might want your data—including hackers, malicious insiders, and even hostile foreign governments—from accessing your phone.  What's more,  Apple is setting a precedent that users, and not companies, should hold the keys to their own devices.  Google has similar protection available for Android phones, though the encryption is not currently a default option. That will change with new Androids out in October. (In other iPhone 6 news, Apple said last week it's received only nine complaints about phones bending.)",Apple: iPhone 6 Is NSA-Proof,Apple: iPhone ____ Is NSA-Proof,6,Copy( 6 ),0

The FDA allows  compassionate use of unapproved drugs in such cases, but the Chimerix pharmaceutical company had insisted that giving the drug to Josh Hardy, who developed a bone marrow disorder after cancer treatment, would delay efforts to get it to market, CNN reports.

The country's health minister says the blast, which caused a mushroom cloud and was heard as far away as Cyprus, 150 miles across the Mediterranean, injured at least 4,000 people, the BBC reports. Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told reporters that the blast was apparently caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a port warehouse since 2014, when it was seized from a cargo ship, reports the AP. Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed that those responsible for the catastrophe will  pay the price.  Other countries in the region—even longtime adversary Israel—have offered humanitarian aid, with Qatar promising to send field hospitals, the Guardian reports. It's not clear what caused the detonation, but witnesses said a fire in a nearby building spread to the warehouse just before the huge explosion.

Of course, there is still the danger of  lone wolf  attacks, like Mohamed Merah in France or home-grown extremists like Anders Behring Breivik (who says he studied al-Qaeda, too). And while al-Qaeda is mostly a shell of what it once was, it has given birth to four major spinoffs that worry intelligence experts, especially the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has made several attempts at hitting the continental United States over the past 18 months, including hiding a bomb in a photocopier toner cartridge in a US-bound plane.",Gutted al-Qaeda Incapable of Another 9/11: Experts,Gutted al-Qaeda Incapable of Another ____: Experts,9/11,Copy( 9/11 ),0

He was 81. Tyner will always be associated with John Coltrane's  classic quartet,  which erupted in the 1960s with pieces like  My Favorite Things  and  A Love Supreme.  As the Washington Post explains, Tyner's  shifting chords  and  fleet-fingered solos  pushed Coltrane's saxophone to greater heights.  Even though John was, so to speak, the engineer of the train, each of us had to fashion his own concept,  Tyner once said.  The stimulation was mutual; while we always felt the strength of John’s presence, he told us that what he played was a reaction to what was happening around him.  Disturbed by Coltrane's increasing atonality, Tyner broke free in 1965 and carved out a solo career that included the landmark album The Real McCoy (1967). He went on to win five Grammys for records including Blues for Coltrane (1987), The Turning Point (1991) and Journey (1993), per the New York Times.

Weak traces of DNA from at least two people have been found in the flat, and police think there might be more on a green hand towel found in Williams' sink. The revelation comes a day after the coroner looking into Williams' death said that the possibility that MI6 had killed him was  still a legitimate line of inquiry.  Police have already taken samples from 15 MI6 employees. They're also looking into whether a telephone reset close to the time of Williams' death might have any clues.

For the past four days, the numbers of users have almost doubled the previous day.  He said the last time he saw any surge like this was in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.

The woman known as  Aunt V  died Friday at a local hospital, where she had been treated for heart arrhythmia and dehydration. Prime Minister Andrew Holness expressed his condolences in a Facebook post, calling her  an inspiring woman.  Brown was born Violet Moss, or Mosse—both spellings were sometimes used—on March 10, 1900, and spent much of her life cutting sugar cane near her home in the Duanvale district in western Jamaica. A biography posted on the website of a foundation named in her honor said she was baptized at age 13 at the Trittonvale Baptist Church and remained a member throughout her life, long serving as organist. She credited her longevity to hard work and her Christian faith. Her husband, Augustus Brown, died in 1997 and the eldest of her six children died in April at age 97. In an interview this year with the AP, Brown said she was surprised but grateful to have lived so long.  This is what God has given me, so I have to take it,  she said.

He was led into a room that consisted solely of him and  five super-wealthy guys  who didn't want to hear a speech but instead wanted to mine him for information about how to prepare for  the Event.

And they had questions like whether using  disciplinary collars  would make the personnel guarding their underground bunker loyal to them. The full anecdote is mesmerizing, but for Rushkoff it's really just a jumping-off point for examining how the pro-human future we were so energized by in the early '90s got lost amidst the allure of unicorn IPOs and potential windfalls. Our  hopes for humankind  gave way to a view that humans are the problem and technology is our saving grace. And that released us from  the real moral quandaries associated with unbridled technological development in the name of corporate capitalism.

Dorothy Craig started by just saying  Mommy  as a baby could be heard crying in the background, KTRK reports. She eventually told the dispatcher her mom was on the ground and hurt. That's about all she said, but it was enough to get Liberty County Sheriff's deputies to the Cleveland home. They had to go door-to-door since the call came from a cell phone and they could only pinpoint the general location and not the exact address. When a deputy spotted through a window a 2-year-old playing in a kitchen sink full of water, he knocked on the door and Dorothy eventually answered, the Houston Chronicle reports. Inside, deputies found the two toddlers, an infant in a car seat, and Miranda, who suffers from narcolepsy and had taught her daughter how to dial 911 for that reason. She says the sudden attacks of sleep caused by the condition thankfully don't happen to her often, but Dorothy had called 911 for her once before.  I am extremely proud of her.

"(Jul 25, 2017  4:48 AM CDT) Two former leaders of an isolated polygamous community in Canada were convicted Monday of practicing polygamy after a decades-long legal fight, setting up another potential court battle over the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws. Winston Blackmore, 60, and James Oler, 53, were found guilty by British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Sheri Ann Donegan, who said the evidence was clear that Blackmore was married to 25 women at the same time and that Oler was married to five women in the tiny community of Bountiful, the AP reports. Blackmore never denied having the wives as part of his religious beliefs that call for  celestial  marriages. His lawyer, Blair Suffredine, has already said Blackmore would challenge the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws if his client was found guilty.  I'm guilty of living my religion and that's all I'm saying today because I've never denied that,  Blackmore told reporters after the verdict.  Twenty-seven years and tens of millions of dollars later, all we've proved is something we've never denied. I've never denied my faith. This is what we expected.  Blackmore and Oler, members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a breakaway Mormon sect that believes in plural marriage, were prosecuted as part of an investigation first launched in the early 1990s by the provincial government. The group's main base is in a small community on the Utah-Arizona border in the United States, but Oler was chosen to lead the Canadian community years ago.

NATO has claimed improvements in security after months of raids, patrols and strikes on insurgents in Kandahar province, but today's blast—the deadliest attack on coalition troops this month—shows the area is still far from safe. Afghan officials said today's suicide attack took place in Kandahar's Zhari district, where Mullah Mohammad Omar organized the Taliban in the early 1990s. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the blast, saying the insurgent group was retaliating for attacks on its fighters in the area in recent months.

The Virunga Massif, made up of three national parks, had only 380 gorillas seven years ago and is now up to 480.  This is a spectacular upsurge,  says a primatologist. Experts say efforts to save the species aren't done, but this  shows that with enough effort it is possible to bring a population back from precariously small numbers,  she says. The 26.3% increase, a growth rate of 3.7% per year, is thanks in part to an effort at decreasing poaching. The International Gorilla Conservation Programme engages local communities in other projects that can make money, like beekeeping, in order to discourage poaching.

Immediately after the signing, the US Department of Transportation opened bidding by American air carriers on as many as 110 US-Cuba flights a day—more than five times the current number. All flights operating between the two countries today are charters. Barring other major announcements, the restart of commercial flights will be the most significant development in US-Cuba trade since President Barack Obama and Raul Castro announced in late 2014 that they would begin normalizing ties after a half-century of Cold War opposition.  Today is a historic day in the relationship between Cuba and the US,  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said after he and Cuban Transportation Minister Adel Yzquierdo Rodriguez signed the deal in a ceremony at Havana's Hotel Nacional.  It represents a critically important milestone in the US effort to engage with Cuba.  The US Department of Transportation expects to award the new routes by the summer. The winning airlines then must negotiate their own deals with Cuba. Foxx said he believes Cuba is eager to restore commercial air service as quickly as possible. US visitors to Cuba will still have to qualify under one of the travel categories legally authorized by the US government. Tourism is still barred by law, but the number of legal reasons to go to Cuba has grown so large and is so loosely enforced that the distinction from tourism has blurred significantly.",US and Cuba Will Have Commercial Flights for First Time in 50 Years,US and Cuba Will Have Commercial Flights for First Time in ____ Years,50,Trans( five decades ),1

Just two days after a 75-vehicle pileup injured at least 17 people in the state, lawmakers in Maine are considering legislation that would allow adults to opt out of wearing seat belts. Sen. Eric Brakey told lawmakers on Friday that it's too bad they're considering his bill so close to Wednesday's crash on Interstate 95, which is thought to be the largest in Maine history but had no fatalities.  It's very unfortunate timing that we're discussing this particular legislation two days after the 75-car pileup that took place on I-95,  Brakey says. The Republican from Auburn acknowledged that people should wear seat belts and said he hopes the accident serves as a reminder of the importance to do so. But said he believes the mandate infringes on people's freedom to make personal decisions.  Government exists to protect us from each other, not to protect us from ourselves,  Brakey told the Transportation Committee, which also examined measures Friday that seek to crack down on people who talk on their cellphone while driving.

Twin 9-year-old boys were left mostly alone in their New Hampshire apartment for four months after their parents took three siblings to Nigeria and left an uncle to care for them, authorities say. Manchester police say the uncle, 25-year-old Giobari Atura, told them he would stop by every couple of days to drop off food, but when police got involved in November, they found no edible food in the refrigerator and only ramen noodles in a cabinet. Atura was charged in December with one count of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. He was freed on $500 bail. Atura's older brother, Jerusalem Monday, left for Nigeria with his wife and three of their children in July, intending to return in August. They told police they were delayed by illness and passport problems.

The boys were taken into protective custody and then placed into foster care, though they're now back with their parents. A Hillsborough County attorney said the parents returned home shortly after they learned the boys were being left alone. Because they left them in the care of a relative, he said, they won't be charged. In a police affidavit, Atura said he told the boys to call him if they needed anything.  It should be noted that no operable phone was located within the apartment,  the affidavit says.

"(Mar 18, 2014  9:58 AM CDT) The fight against colon cancer through screening is  one of the great public health success stories of the decade,  says a top figure at the American Cancer Society: In people over 50, colon cancer rates have dropped by 30% over the past decade, researchers say. That's mostly thanks to screening through colonoscopies, which aim to spot polyps before they become a problem, USA Today reports. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of 50- to 64-year-olds who have received the procedure has almost tripled. Among the 65-plus set, 64% had had a colonoscopy in 2010, compared to 55% in 2000. Between 2008 and 2010, colon cancer rates fell 7.2% per year, while death rates from the disease have dropped about 3% per year over 10 years. Still, it's the third leading cause of cancer death in the US, and the ACS expects 50,310 to die from the disease this year, with 136,830 new diagnoses. The progress is driving an effort to get 80% of those over age 50 screened by 2018, NPR reports. Some 23 million people between ages 50 and 75 still haven't been screened.

For centuries, being able to afford the delicacy was a sign of prosperity—and with many Chinese coming into a time of just that, many are worried the booming country’s demand for shark’s fin will go too far. But along with slamming the distasteful process of ‘finning,’ critics are also beginning to notice how absolutely flavorless the fins themselves really are. After an arduous soaking and boiling process, Eilperin writes that the fins are  finally boiled for six to eight hours with chicken stock and Chinese ham to add flavor because there’s no taste otherwise.

The museum, a companion to the 9/11 memorial, was supposed to be finished by this year's 11th anniversary, but officials now say that's not possible. The holdup stems from a financial battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation that controls the memorial and museum, reports the AP. The Port Authority says the foundation owes it $300 million for infrastructure and updated project costs; the foundation counters that the port owes it money because of project delays. Personal items that families have donated to the museum are stuck in storage while the dispute, which has slowed down work since late last year, drags on.

His rapid-fire flatpicking style influenced generations of musicians, and helped elevate the guitar to lead instrument status in the country music of the '50s and '60s, AP notes.

His serious music career only began when he was in his 40s and was discovered by a folklorist—but he went on to record 60 albums, seven of which won Grammy awards. He founded the Merlefest music festival in 1985 after the death of his son, who toured with him for many years.

He was 94. Megan Bond, a close friend who managed his affairs, told the AP that Beckey died of natural causes in her Seattle home Monday. She described him as a  brilliant writer  and  extraordinary mountaineer  with  a personality and humor that almost dwarfed the mountains around him.  But though he  made as many as a thousand ascents that no one was known to have taken before,  the German-born climber who immigrated to Seattle, Wash., as a child, avoided publicity and was  virtually unknown to the general public,  reports the New York Times. Choosing mountains over people (he never married or had kids), Beckey often climbed 50 peaks in a single year. In 1942, he and his younger brother, Helmut, wowed the climbing community with an impressive second ascent of Mount Waddington in British Columbia. He went on to accomplish hundreds of first ascents on peaks throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada, and Wyoming. In 1954, he established new routes on three of Alaska's mountains: McKinley, Deborah, and Hunter.

Perot, whose 19% of the vote in 1992 stands among the best showings by an independent candidate in the past century, died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family, family spokesman James Fuller said, per the AP. Perot's wealth, fame, and confident prescription for the nation's economic ills propelled his 1992 campaign against President George HW Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Some Republicans blamed him for Bush's loss to Clinton as Perot garnered the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 bid. During the campaign, Perot spent $63.5 million of his own money and bought up 30-minute television spots. He used charts and graphs to make his points, summarizing them with a line that became a national catchphrase:  It's just that simple.  As a boy in Texarkana, Texas, Perot delivered newspapers from the back of a pony.

Her long-term relationship was ending and a fertility test indicated her 34-year-old ovaries were registering about a decade older. Her fertility research led her to Sherman Silber, a Missouri fertility doctor who claimed he had a procedure that could  put [women's] biological clocks on ice,  as NPR put it in 2012. That procedure is removing part or all of an ovary, freezing it, then transplanting it back in once a woman is ready to have kids. Not only did Gardner, who lives in Australia, go that route, but her twin sister, Joanne, who lives in London, did the same.  It really just took a huge weight off us,  Sarah tells NPR, which notes the now 44-year-old siblings each had an ovary removed in 2012 and just had them reimplanted in St. Louis in June. Freezing ovaries was initially designed for cancer patients, and a reproductive medicine professor at Cornell's Weill Medical College calls it  irresponsible  to push ovary freezing for women without the disease. But Silber, who notes the Gardner sisters may be the first non-cancer patients to try the technique, says it's easy, safe, and has upsides over egg freezing: weeks of hormone injections aren't needed, and the total price tag is less than $3,000. The Gardner sisters, meanwhile, both hope to be pregnant by the end of 2016—and hope the procedure will turn back the clock on menopause, which they've both entered.

The retired Sosa, sixth on the all-time homer list, has long been suspected of taking steroids but has never admitted it. The new development, courtesy of unnamed lawyers familiar with the 2003 results, is the first time he's been linked to a positive test. These are the same test results that forced A-Rod to admit earlier this year that he had juiced, too. The tests, the first such conducted by the league, were supposed to remain anonymous, but names continue to trickle out. The revelation could raise legal trouble for Sosa, notes the Times, because he testified to Congress in 2005 that he never took  illegal performance-enhancing drugs.",Sosa Tested Positive in 2003,Sosa Tested Positive in ____,2003,Copy( 2003 ),0
"(Aug 4, 2017  7:46 AM CDT) It's another solid jobs report: The US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July as the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3%, per the AP. That ties a 16-year low reached in May. The job gains exceeded expectations of about 180,000, but the Wall Street Journal notes that the news isn't all rosy: It still seems that nobody is getting raises. Average hourly pay was up 2.5% over this time last year, a sluggish pace that has been consistent all year. When the jobless rate is as low as it is, wage growth is typically closer to 4%. Still, the July report comes with a positive milestone: The gains mean the US has now erased the massive job losses caused by the recession, reports the Washington Post. The newspaper cites research by the Brookings Institution showing that, factoring in for population shifts, the nation's employment level is now back to what it was in November 2007.  It does not mean there's no slack in the economy, [or] that we're at full employment,  says report co-author Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach.

"(Jun 16, 2017  12:04 PM CDT) A $2.8 million award was at stake in Maryland's 2016 White Marlin Open tournament—but the only participant to catch a qualifying white marlin won't be getting that prize after he and his crew failed polygraph tests. Officials believe Philip Heasley and his shipmates caught the 76.5-pound fish before 8:30am on Aug. 9, the official time participants were allowed to cast fishing lines. Polygraph tests are required in tournament rules, and when Heasley failed two of them, the award was withheld. More than 10 months later, after a two-week trial, a judge sided with tournament organizers Wednesday and ruled against Heasley, disqualifying him from the competition, Delmarva Now reports. White Marlin Open officials said in a Facebook post Wednesday they are  pleased that [the tournament's] reputation for integrity, built over its forty-three-year history, has been upheld,  noting that organizers simply wanted  to protect the integrity of the tournament and to ensure that the rules are applied fairly for all participants.  The prize money will instead be shared by 13 other fishermen who won other categories in last year's competition, the Baltimore Sun reports. Heasley's lawyer says they are  disappointed  by the ruling and continue to maintain that all rules and regulations were followed. The attorney says they  are reviewing the decision and are considering our options.  Heasley has 30 days to appeal.

"(Feb 11, 2020  8:26 AM) If it seems like girls these days are hitting puberty earlier than in decades past, you're not imagining things—and researchers now suggest obesity and environmental chemicals may be playing a role. The Guardian reports on new research out of the University of Copenhagen that looked at 30 global studies on thelarche, which is the beginning of the development of glandular breast tissue, widely seen as the first sign of puberty's onset. Scientists found, per the research published in the Feb. 10 edition of JAMA Pediatrics, that puberty in girls has started about three months earlier per decade from 1977 to 2013—meaning girls today are heading into puberty about a year earlier than their '70s counterparts. The researchers also found this early breast-tissue development varies around the world, and over time: The average age of onset in the US is 8.8 to 10.3 years, while in Europe it's between 9.8 and 10.8 years, and in Africa 10.1 to 13.2 years. How this affects girls in the long term isn't clear, though study co-author Alexander Busch notes an early arrival of the final clinical sign of puberty, menstrual bleeding, has been tied to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, per HealthDay. The latter may even be partly responsible for puberty's early call: The researchers note a higher BMI has been associated with an earlier menstruation kickoff, while chemicals in the environment like DDT and DDE have also been linked to earlier puberty. More research is needed, the scientists say, as  a younger age at pubertal onset may change current diagnostic decision-making.",Modern Girls Hit Puberty a Year Earlier Than '70s Counterparts,Modern Girls Hit Puberty a Year Earlier Than '____s Counterparts,70,Copy( 70 ),0

Officials have confirmed that a 1960 Studebaker found in a creek last year contained the remains of the two 17-year-olds—and they appear to be the victims of a car crash, not foul play, the AP reports. The car was in the highest gear and the lights were on when it crashed, say investigators who suspect a tire blew when the girls were on their way to an end-of-school party, sending the car into the creek where it lay for 42 years until it was exposed by drought. Investigators do not believe alcohol was a factor. The girls were found in the car's front seats, and  the forensic pathology and anthropology reports indicate that there's no type of injury that would be consistent with or caused by foul play or inappropriate conduct,  the state's attorney general told reporters. A high school classmate already serving a 227-year sentence for rape and kidnapping was charged in 2007 with murdering the girls, but charges were dropped after prosecutors found that a jailhouse informant had lied. The attorney general said he was glad to be able to bring closure to the families, and deliver news that wouldn't lead to further suffering, Vermillion Plain Talk reports.

"(Mar 28, 2018  7:30 AM CDT) Once it was thought hardly anyone ventured into the Amazon before Europeans arrived in South America, instead keeping close to major rivers. But that was before satellites combed the region. Archaeologists at the University of Exeter who surveyed satellite images in areas of deforestation have uncovered 81 previously unknown Amazon settlements—some covering hectares, others as small as 100 feet wide—marked by fortification ditches, sunken roads, ceramic fragments, and earth platforms on which wooden houses would've stood between 1250 and 1500, reports the Guardian.  We filled the last piece of a puzzle in Amazonian archaeology,  study author Jonas Gregorio de Souza tells Live Science, describing a network of settlements believed to have covered 154,000 square miles of the Amazon's southern rim, perhaps supporting a population in the millions in the pre-Columbian era. Archaeologists couldn't get access to all 81 sites in the upper Tapajós Basin, but examined 24 in person and believe hundreds more exist. In addition to upending the idea that the Amazon was mostly untouched, their study in Nature Communications  definitively discredits early low estimates of 1.5-2 million inhabitants for the whole basin,  they say, per USA Today, and shows settlements next to small streams and springs may have hosted large populations. Though linked to other settlements, the sites each have  a different local expression of … architectural traditions,  says de Souza.  There are different kinds of site layouts and artifacts that are found in each of the regions.  De Souza adds many questions remain, but  the big debate is how populations were distributed.  Scientists expect to learn more as additional sites are discovered and examined.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said a 16-year-old Palestinian drew a knife on officers in Jerusalem when they stopped him to ask for identification after a bystander said he was behaving suspiciously. She said the officers shot and killed the teenager after he tried to stab them. The incident took place near where two Palestinian men boarded a bus earlier in the week and began shooting and stabbing passengers, killing two. Elsewhere on Saturday, Israel's military said an Israeli pedestrian shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab him in the West Bank city of Hebron, a frequent flashpoint where a few hundred Jewish settlers live in close proximity to tens of thousands of Palestinians. The military said the Palestinian was shot dead before he could harm the man. Later, police said a Palestinian woman stabbed a female officer at a border police base in Hebron before the officer shot her dead. The officer's hand was lightly wounded. Over the past month, eight Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 39 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 18 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops.The violence erupted a month ago over the Jewish New Year, fueled by rumors that Israel was plotting to take over Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine and a key national symbol for the Palestinians.

Good news out of Abertay University in Scotland, where researchers put 12 retired people to the test. Coming in twice a week for six weeks, the volunteers, all over age 60, were instructed to bike for 6-second bursts of high intensity on an exercise bike, then rest for at least one minute. The bursts gradually increased until, by the end of the trial, they were doing 10 of them per session, for a full minute of total exercise, reports the Daily Mail. The result? A 9% reduction in blood pressure, an increased ability to get oxygen to their muscles, and an easier go at day-to-day activities like walking the dog, the BBC reports.  The broad message is that you're never too old, too frail, too ill to benefit from exercise, as long as it's carefully chosen,  the honorary secretary of the British Geriatrics Society says, adding that he'd like to see the research done on people in their 80s and 90s. The researchers say that this is the first time this type of high-intensity training has been studied in seniors, and they're already planning larger trials. Perhaps counterintuitively, these bursts of effort could be safer for the heart than a reduced yet prolonged strain, one researcher explains.

The day's attacks began early in the north of Iraq and ended with deadly bomb explosions near busy markets, restaurants, and ice cream parlors shortly before midnight. It was Iraq's deadliest day in more than three weeks. The attacks seemed meant to strike fear in Iraqis and undermine faith in the Shiite-led government's security measures ahead of what was supposed to be a festive holiday weekend. Among the higher casualty numbers disclosed today were 21 people killed when a car bomb detonated shortly before midnight near an ice cream shop in Baghdad's predominantly Shiite Zafaraniyah neighborhood, according to police and hospital officials. Fourteen people were also killed in another bomb attack near an ice cream parlor in another poor Shiite district.

Per LawNewz, TV weatherman Kyle Hunter, who hired the celebrity lawyer to represent him in his claim that CBS discriminated against him in favor of pretty young meteorologists, filed a legal malpractice and fraud suit against Allred on Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Hunter's specific beef: that Allred messed up key parts of his defense, and that she didn't clue him in that she and CBS were developing a legal drama based on her life, which he says is a conflict of interest. All of this led to  a near-seven-figure legal bill for Hunter, a sunk suit against CBS, and [his] impaired reputation,  per his complaint. (The suit, which is asking for $1 million in damages, was filed by a lawyer who contributes op-eds to LawNewz). In the suit, Hunter blasts Allred and other lawyers at her firm for not interviewing witnesses who may have helped his case, among other grievances. Per Variety, Hunter's suit says the $800,000 legal bill he had to pay when he lost to CBS left him near bankruptcy. LawNewz also uncovered in March that the State Bar of California is looking into Allred's actions for misconduct, for undisclosed reasons.

All of these came about at least in part because of the pressure brought by an intense band of family members,  writes Levin. Their work led to the conviction of one of the bombers, and it forced Libya to pay millions in restitution to the loved ones of the 270 people killed. Still, it's little consolation for many.  For those who've lost their kids, you don't get closure,  says one grieving father.","20 Years Later, Lockerbie Families' Work Endures","____ Years Later, Lockerbie Families' Work Endures",20,Copy( 20 ),0

Inexplicable no more: It was the CIA, reports the BBC. Actually, it was the CIA itself that fessed up in this tweet, which reads in part,  Remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the '50s? That was us.  It then provides a government writeup about the sightings, which weren't caused by alien spaceships but by U2 spy planes being tested. The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it. The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the U2 planes caught the rays of the sun just right, even people on the ground would see silvery glints of light. The explanation was kept classified for decades, notes the BBC, picking up on a report in the foreign-language Aftenposten.",1950s Norwegian UFO Mystery Solved,____s Norwegian UFO Mystery Solved,1950,Copy( 1950 ),0

The CEO says the engines need to be replaced because of a faulty component that caused an engine in a Qantas jet to catch fire and disintegrate earlier this month, Bloomberg reports. Qantas has grounded its A380s but Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa have kept theirs in the air after switching some engines and stepping up inspections. Airbus is scheduled to hand over 20 new A380s to airlines next year but it may end up needing to use some engines from those aircraft to carry out replacements.

Often we were called by a number, not even a name. It's a shameful part of Australia's history,  said one victim. Most of the British children shipped to Australia were told they were orphans, but in fact they were taken from their mothers as illegitimate babies—and often their parents did not know they were shipped away.

The groundbreaking comedian has applied for guardianship while her daughter, Erin Hamilton, deals with substance abuse issues.  Due to addiction issues and other circumstances that my daughter, Erin, has been struggling with impacting her immediate family dynamic, my husband and I have petitioned the court to be appointed legal guardian of my 14-year-old grandson,  Burnett said in a statement to People. In court papers, Burnett said her 52-year-old daughter has long suffered from  severe substance abuse and addiction issues.  She said Erin has been institutionalized eight times in the last 19 years and attempted suicide last month. She said Dylan's father, Kurt West, recently checked into a rehab center and is also unable to care for the teen. Burnett has applied for guardianship along with husband Brian Miller, who is 23 years her junior. She says the arrangement will be for  oversight purposes concerning his health, education, and welfare and not intended to deny him nor the parents proper visitation with one another.  Burnett has dealt with family addiction issues before. Both her parents were alcoholics who died in their 40s, and another daughter, Carrie Hamilton, was a heavy drug user in her teens.

"(Dec 12, 2015  9:15 AM) The San Bernardino rampage was the deadliest mass shooting on US soil since Sandy Hook. But it stands out for another reason. Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik left behind a 6-month-old daughter. Few people know what it's like to be the child of a mass shooter because, as an expert explains, most shooters are childless or their children become victims. But Zelia Huberty knows what it's like. On July 18, 1984, she watched as her dad, James Huberty, left their apartment in San Ysidro, Calif., telling his 12-year-old daughter that he'd never be back. Then he drove 200 yards to a McDonald's and started shooting, killing 20 people and injuring 20 more before he was killed by a sniper's bullet.  If I could go back in time I probably would have killed my father before any of this would have occurred,  Zelia Huberty tells Vocativ in her first interview in 30 years.  I had a perfect view of it. I saw the car there. I saw everything. I saw people I knew, who I went to school with,  she says.  I wasn't thinking anything that time, except, 'Better them than me.' I know that's a horrible thing to say, but as a 12-year-old, that's the sort of thing you think.  For 12 weeks, she kept silent in mandated therapy sessions. She took on an assumed name in high school—an expert says families of mass shooters  often become demonized —and for a time feared she would become just like her old man. But  I moved forward and proceeded with life,  Huberty says.  I'm a nurse, so I help others. And that's been my own therapy.  What advice does she have for Farook and Malik's daughter, whom Farook's sister is attempting to adopt, per the San Bernardino Sun?  I would tell that little girl: You have a choice to make.

Their father Zachary escaped to the garage and started hitting a car horn to try to get neighbors' attention; his wife Yvonne ran upstairs to hide and call 911. Sgt.

"(Jul 6, 2020  4:04 AM CDT) The WHO still won't call the coronavirus airborne, even though evidence increasingly shows it is indeed transmissible that way and experts have been warning for months that more attention needs to be paid to transmission via aerosols. Now, 239 scientists from more than 30 countries have published an open letter to the health agency urging it to reconsider its official stance on the matter, which currently states only that the research is inconclusive.  There is no incontrovertible proof that SARS-CoV-2 travels or is transmitted significantly by aerosols, but there is absolutely no evidence that it’s not,  one doctor tells the New York Times.  So at the moment we have to make a decision in the face of uncertainty, and my goodness, it’s going to be a disastrous decision if we get it wrong. So why not just mask up for a few weeks, just in case?  The WHO's official stance is that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted via larger respiratory droplets, which typically can only travel about 6 feet before they fall to the ground. Aerosols, on the other hand, are smaller particles that can travel much longer distances and linger in the air, meaning that if the virus is transmitted that way, crowded indoor spaces, especially those with poor ventilation, are a big risk even when social distancing can be maintained. That means more measures (from masks to upgraded air filters and UV lights) may be necessary for true protection.  WHO’s credibility is being undermined through a steady drip-drip of confusing messages, including asymptomatic spread, the use of masks, and now airborne transmission,  one expert tells the Washington Post. The Times has much more, including how a  dated  definition of airborne transmission might be contributing and why it's difficult to study aerosols.",239 Scientists to WHO: Come On.

In the process of moving it, the Los Angeles Times reports, he left the rare Amati in his white Tesla for a moment while he was in his Los Angeles home. When he came outside, they were both gone. The car had been unlocked, because Weinstein had dropped the key fob behind the driver's seat. Police suspect a car thief was working the Los Feliz area and may not have known what he was taking. When he realizes the violin's value, he might try to pawn the Amati or sell it overseas, an FBI spokeswoman said.  So it's critical to get the information to the public so that hopefully somebody who received it, or is offered it, can identify it and return it to its rightful owner.  The FBI posted its request for tips here. Weinstein has put up a $25,000 reward for information. Weinstein, an art dealer, is well aware of the violin's value, which probably is more than $700,000. He paid more than $500,000 for it in 2013, per the Times.  I'm responsible for a piece of history, and that piece of history got away from me,  he said.  It's so fragile. My biggest fear is that someone who doesn’t know what they have will put it in the wrong environment and it will get damaged or destroyed.  In fact, the FBI said, per the Canyon News, it's considered a work of art. The violin was still being used; Weinstein doesn't play, but he's let others who do pick it up. The director of the auction house where Weinstein bought the violin is hopeful. Stolen pieces  go off the map for years sometimes, but then they often resurface,  he said.

In the decades since, nearly 99% has been relocated or rebuilt, and transferred from private to public ownership. It will always be in the same general area, says the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's executive director. But as access to waterways or scenic landscapes along the trail becomes available for purchase, it will continue to shift.  Will it move a little to the left, a little to the right?  he said.  Yes. One of the tenets of the trail is to provide that personal experience of sort of being one with nature. You can't necessarily do that if you're walking along a major highway.  As many as 3 million people a year now visit some part of the trail; about 2,000 to 3,000 people each summer attempt a  thru-hike,  or journey along the entire length. Only one in four will succeed.","99% of Appalachian Trail Has Been Moved, Rebuilt","____% of Appalachian Trail Has Been Moved, Rebuilt",99,Copy( 99 ),0

Memphis Burgess, a 13-year-old from Colorado Springs, Colo., was found by his dad Dec. 10 kneeling against his closet wall with a soft rope nearby, KKTV reports.  I thought he was messing with me and I shook his shoulder,  Brad Burgess tells the station.  That's when he turned around [and] I noticed he was all blue and not breathing.  The choking game creates a sense of euphoria by cutting off the brain's oxygen supply, typically by tightening an item like a tie or scarf around a person's neck, then loosening it right before the participant passes out. It's thought to have resulted in at least 1,000 deaths since 1934, according to GASP stats cited in the Post, and was documented in medical journals at least as far back as 1951. Many of these deaths are thought to be suicides by parents and cops who may never have heard of the game, per the Post. And it's a type of  recreation  that's alluring to certain teens, the Post adds: It's known as the  good kids' high,  per Salon, appealing to children who wouldn't normally drink or do drugs, and a slew of YouTube videos showing other kids taking part makes it seem innocuous.

This is kind of a bottom line for the president,  Reuters quotes a senior White House official as saying. The plan unveiled Thursday would provide a possibility of citizenship—contingent on  work, education, and good moral character —to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, USA Today reports. That's a million more Dreamers than were protected by DACA. The White House calls it a  dramatic concession  to Democrats. In return for that concession, the White House is asking for a $25 billion  trust fund  to build parts of President Trump's long-promised wall on the Mexican border and improve security on the Canadian border. More money would go to additional border guards and immigration judges. The plan restricts family-based immigration to only spouses and minor children. That change represents a 25% reduction in legal immigration into the US—about 250,000 people per year. The plan also ends the visa lottery system, which provides 50,000 visas a year to people from countries under-represented in the US. Another part of the plan closes what the White House calls  legal loopholes  in order to allow for the deportation of more immigrants.

The New York Times reports that this has been worst summer for the film industry in North America since 1997. Ticket sales from May through August are expected to come in at $3.9 billion, down 15% from last year. While movies such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Angelina Jolie's Maleficient, and Scarlett Johansson's Lucy did relatively well, supposed blockbusters such as Edge of Tomorrow and Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn't meet expectations, and sequels in general didn't seem to have the lure they once did. Studios will surely counter that ticket sales must be counted worldwide now, not just in North America, but  what they do not often mention is that overseas ticket sales are often less profitable,  writes Brooks Barnes.  In China, for instance, as little as 25 cents of every box office dollar comes back to Hollywood; in the United States, it’s 50 percent.  So is this a sign of things to come?

The award from a Los Angeles Superior Court jury fell short of the $30 million the legendary producer sought in the lawsuit filed nearly four years ago, but well above the approximately $392,000 the Jackson estate contended Jones was owed. The jury of 10 women and two men had been deliberating since Monday, the AP reports.  This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,  Jones wrote in a statement.  Although this (judgment) is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter,  Jones wrote.  I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists' rights overall.  Estate attorney Howard Weitzman says he and his team are surprised and disappointed by the verdict. He says the estate plans an appeal. Jones claimed in the lawsuit that Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment owed him for music he had produced that was used in the concert film This Is It and two Cirque du Soleil shows that used Jackson's songs.

The head of a man who fought in the medieval-era Crusades was  severed from his body and taken away  from the crypt of St. Michan's church in Dublin sometime before Monday afternoon, when a tour guide spotted damage to several mummies, Archdeacon David Pierpoint tells the BBC.  To have them desecrated in such a sacrilegious way is so distressing and disturbing. I can't put it in words, I'm quite disgusted,  he tells the Irish Times, noting the head of a nun who lived 400 years ago had been rotated 180 degrees. Another mummy was turned on its side, while remains in a coffin in the family crypt of Irish mathematician William Hamilton were  dragged out,  Pierpoint says. The vandals  have destroyed these historic mummies which have been preserved in St Michan's for hundreds of years,  Dublin Archbishop Michael Jackson says, per TheJournal.ie.  I would appeal to those responsible to examine their consciences and return the head of The Crusader to its rightful place.  Police are checking CCTV footage from the church. It was previously vandalized in 1996, though the perpetrators in that case—teenagers who  seemed to be playing football  with the heads of corpses—were caught, according to Pierpoint.

John Potter asked lawmakers to lift the requirement that the agency deliver mail 6 days a week.  It is possible that the cost of 6-day delivery may simply prove to be unaffordable,  Potter said. Faced with dwindling mail volume and rising costs, the post office was $2.8 billion in the red last year and faces a $6 billion loss this year. Total mail volume was 202 billion items last year, more than 9 billion less than the year before, the largest single volume drop in history.

Per a release from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, the  concerned  viewer was watching an episode of the Pursuit Channel's Hunting in the Sticks show entitled  Western Redemption  when he noticed that the licenses of hunters Ricky Mills and Jimmy Duncan, who killed two bull elk on the show, didn't seem to match up with the area in which they were hunting. They claimed to be in one spot but were in fact in another  highly coveted hunt area  in which elk can only be harvested every other year. The department, along with a local game warden, received the viewer's tip and opened an investigation, in which they visited the kill sites and started gathering proof. They also discovered that Mills and Duncan had tried to do the same thing in 2013, and that Duncan had succeeded that year in killing an antelope without a license. The department's investigative lead says he thinks the men made  bad decisions  under pressure to get footage for the show. At their sentencing Monday, Duncan, 25, was told to pony up $17,500 in restitution and fines, while Mills, 37, was hit up for $13,460. Both suspects were also banned from hunting and fishing in 44 states, including their home state, for 15 years, per the Wildlife Violator Compact. The men also have to hand over their elk mounts.

"(Feb 3, 2015  9:45 AM) To Kill a Mockingbird will not be Harper Lee's only published book after all. Publisher Harper announced today that Go Set a Watchman, a novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author completed in the 1950s and put aside, will be released July 14. Rediscovered last fall, Go Set a Watchman is essentially a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although it was finished earlier. The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years. The publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies.  In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman,  the 88-year-old Lee said in a statement issued by Harper.  It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became To Kill a Mockingbird) from the point of view of the young Scout.   I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.  Carter came upon the manuscript at a  secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird,  the publisher says. The new book is set in Lee's famed Maycomb, Ala., during the mid-1950s, 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird and roughly contemporaneous with the time that Lee was writing the story. Lee's publisher said the author is unlikely to do any publicity for the book. And despite Lee's stated preference for paper, Watchman will also be released in electronic form.",Harper Lee Is Publishing Her 2nd Novel,Harper Lee Is Publishing Her ____nd Novel,2,Copy( 2 ),0

His dad, Tom Rose, says the young man was working his first job and crossing the 520 bridge daily without a Good to Go pass—figuring he'd pay later, KING-TV reports. But the Washington State Department of Transportation didn't have the son's right address, so no bill came in the mail.

He thought he was picking the lesser of two evils. He could save up and pay for them later.  Luckily WSDOT says it's willing to strike a deal on the man's penalties, but there are other cases of high Good to Go bills. In fact, a recent class-action lawsuit claims that Good to Go billing violated due process by not always notifying a driver of her outstanding bills and penalties, notes KING-TV. Other drivers have felt WSDOT's billing wrath and learned they can't complain in local courts, where elected judges might rule in their favor; billing complaints go to a  merciless administrative review set up by the transportation agency itself,  writes Danny Westneat in the Seattle Times.

The Canadian mom just couldn't believe it when she learned she had survived for six days without lungs—an impressive feat detailed in a study published Wednesday. According to the Guardian, Benoit, 32, was born with cystic fibrosis. After she came down with a flu that left her coughing so hard she fractured ribs, she was admitted to the hospital in April, the Canadian Press reports. There, doctors realized she had only hours to live. Benoit's lungs were failing, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was sending her into septic shock, dropping her blood pressure, and knocking her organs out of commission. Life support wasn't working. Desperate, surgeons decided to remove Benoit's lungs—the source of the bacteria—and go from there. Doctors say  there were a lot of unknowns —as far as they know, nothing like this had ever been done before—but got  courage  knowing that Benoit would  for sure  die that day if they did nothing. It took 13 people nine hours to remove Benoit's lungs, which were swollen and hard with mucus. They had no idea how long they'd have to wait until a new set of lungs would be available for transplant. In the meantime, they hooked Benoit's heart to an artificial lung. Within minutes, her blood pressure returned to normal. Six days later, she received a successful lung transplant. Benoit says doctors  pulled me back from the dead.

Potato #345  from celebrity photographer Kevin Abosch is just that: a portrait of an organic Irish potato against a black background. But a businessman who spotted the image at Abosch's Paris home last year was apparently transfixed.  We had two glasses of wine and he said, 'I really like that,'  Abosch tells the Sunday Times, per the BBC.  Two more glasses of wine and he said, 'I really want that.' We set the price two weeks later.  The deal, which is only now being reported, was the biggest of Abosch's career, CNN reports. If the price is confirmed,  Potato #345  would be the 15th most expensive photo ever sold. And the 64-inch square photo, snapped in 2010, isn't even the only one out there, per Mashable. Another copy of  Potato #345  was sold earlier and a third was donated to a museum in Serbia. What's so great about this dirty potato? The 46-year-old Irishman says it was simply delivered to him along with other organic vegetables.  Generally, the life of a harvested potato is violent and taken for granted. I use the potato as a proxy for the ontological study of the human experience,  says Abosch, who's also photographed Johnny Depp, Steven Spielberg, and Malala Yousafzai.

Linklater is planning an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical Merrily We Roll Along, which is to be shot over 20 years, per Collider.

Conversion therapy is a practice used to try to change sexual orientation or gender identity, and many people who have been through it say it deepened feelings of depression and increased thoughts of suicide. The change in Utah comes after the state hammered out a regulatory rule that had the support of the influential Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

"(Jul 9, 2013  12:56 PM CDT) Miami-area police got a call this weekend about some skinny-looking horses; what they found were two horses that were 200 pounds underweight and stuck in an 8-by-10-foot pen at an area ranch. The stall was boarded up, apparently to avoid notice.  It was almost like they were being nailed into a coffin to die,  says the local SPCA president Jeanette Jordan.  This is as bad as it gets for us.  The horses had had no food or water for months—even though a lake was apparently visible to them from their stall.  They could see the water, but they couldn’t get it,  Jordan says. They kept themselves alive by eating wood and their own manure, Jordan tells the Miami Herald. Now they're staying at a nearby rescue ranch. Their recovery could take months, and they may not survive at all, the Herald notes.

Owens is now suing New York City and 11 NYPD officers for wrongfully arresting him in the early hours of Oct. 23, 2012, as well as for the six weeks he languished at Rikers Island until his case was dropped for lack of evidence. Owens says in the suit that his trouble started when he clocked out of his stock clerk job at Macy's at 3am, then headed home on the No. 1 subway, per Newsweek. But several cops got on the train at the 50th Street station,  demanded  Owens' ID, removed him from the train, and searched him. The problem: a crying  Caucasian woman  who said her backpack had been stolen at a train station at 2:30am.  The woman's description of the culprit was limited at best—i.e., a young African American male with a dark hoodie,  the lawsuit states. Owens had no backpack, offered up his punched timecard, and gave cops contact info for his supervisor, but police took the word of the witness—described in the police affidavit as  erratic, possibly intoxicated, and definitely hysterical,  per the Daily News—and carted Owens off. He was charged with grand larceny and thrown in jail, where he stayed for six weeks because he couldn't pay the $3,500 bail—a stint that cost him his job.  He became a victim of the worst stereotype there is: a young African-American male in a hoodie up to no good,  his lawyer says.

The dog returned home that day, but Stavik's body, showing evidence of rape and possible drowning, was later found in a river. DNA was collected, and in the years after the murder, more than 50 people voluntarily provided DNA samples to police. Timothy Forrest Bass, who lived on the same street as Stavik's family, refused, report KIRO and the Sky Valley Chronicle. Decades later, however, authorities would get the sample they say has solved the case: Bass, 50, who works at a bakery, allegedly bragged about getting away with murder, leading a co-worker to collect a Coke can he discarded, per KIRO and CBS News. Police say DNA taken from the can matches DNA from Stavik's body. Bass, who now lives in Everson, Wash., was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and rape, per the Bellingham Herald. His bail has been set at $1 million. Authorities say he has no criminal record, though his wife filed a protection order against Bass in 2010, accusing him of physical and emotional abuse. According to court documents, she said Bass told her  people have made me so angry before and I can see why people murder other people.  His wife also said Bass watched TV shows about cold cases and once told her,  I wouldn't get caught because I'm not that stupid. It would be easy to get away with it.

The southeast Asia air carrier burns its cash reserves at nearly $2.16 million each day,  said Howard University professor Oliver McGee, as per Mashable.  Operations are losing about $1.6 million a day.  Customers are posting pictures of rows of empty seats, even as the company is reportedly offering commission hikes to travel agents and huge discounts to customers. On many carriers, a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing can cost more than $500; on Malaysia Airlines, it's recently been less than half that, Mashable notes. What's an airline to do? Well, it's poised to cut about 25% of its staff, the Wall Street Journal reports. It also looks ready to get rid of some of its routes, including unprofitable journeys to some areas of China and flights to Frankfurt. A name change could also be on the table, Mashable notes. The possible changes are driven by state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which owns some 70% of the carrier's parent company and is hoping to take the airline private, the Journal notes.

Since June 2008, USPS has been paying about $31,000 a year to lease a property in South Abington Township; it's at last due to be  occupied  starting this June, the Scranton Times-Tribune reports.  The lease started on the building in June 2008 with the expectation to complete the construction to occupy the building for postal operations soon thereafter,  says a Post Office rep. But concerns ranging from drainage issues to traffic have plagued the spot. A development plan was submitted in 2010, but the Post Office withdrew after construction began. It later returned; then a berm built to prevent flooding got in the way of a planned driveway. An existing driveway, meanwhile, raised driving safety issues. Last year, the township said the Post Office could use a nearby road if it would pay for widening. If that plan goes through, construction should begin again.

But that's what may be in store for some online commenters who complained about Arizona's Digital Homicide Studios, a game-maker founded by brothers James and Robert Romine. The Arizona Republic reports James Romine filed a complaint last week looking to sue up to 100 players for up to $18 million for charges including harassment, stalking, and criminal impersonation. Some of the alleged attacks against Digital Homicide, per court docs, include miffed commenters saying they wished the Romines would die and sending them feces in the mail, per the GoFundMe account James set up (with $425 so far toward a $75,000 goal to recoup business losses). The battle between the Romines and the  reviewers  is now being framed as an issue of self-preservation for small-business owners versus commenters' rights to free speech. The infighting started in late 2014, when a YouTube personality named Jim Sterling said some nonflattering things about a Digital Homicide game—and the Romines fired back in a response video, calling him a  [expletive] idiot  who will  flap [his] stupid mouth.  Sterling's fans retaliated with a flood of online harassment, the Romines say. Polygon.com reports Valve Corporation, which owns Steam, has since removed all Digital Homicide games from the platform—a move the Romines say has been a huge financial hit.

"(Sep 27, 2017  5:17 PM CDT) The Trump administration defended its decision Wednesday to sharply curtail the number of refugees allowed into the US to 45,000 next year, even as global humanitarian groups decried the move and called the number far too low. The 45,000 cap, to be formally announced by President Trump in the coming days, reflects the maximum the US will admit during the fiscal year that starts Sunday, although the actual number allowed could be far lower, the AP reports. Even if the cap is ultimately hit, it would reflect the lowest admissions level for the US in more than a decade. Lowering the cap reflects Trump's opposition to accepting refugees and other immigrants into the US, an approach that has already driven down refugee admissions. President Obama had wanted to take in 110,000 in 2017, but the pace slowed dramatically after Trump took office and issued an executive order addressing refugees. The total admitted in the fiscal year that ends Sunday is expected to be around 54,000, officials said. In 2016, the last full year of Obama's administration, the US welcomed 84,995 refugees.",Trump Caps Refugees at 45K in Coming Year,Trump Caps Refugees at ____K in Coming Year,45,"Paraphrase( 45,000 , K )",1

Chusovitina first competed in a world championship in 1991, on the Soviet team.

The story is only slightly less surprising because that man was Dr. Bendor Grosvenor of the BBC program Britain's Lost Masterpieces. Grosvenor noticed the painting of George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, during a visit to the historic Pollok House in Glasgow, according to the BBC.  There was this painting further up by the fireplace and it sounds rather silly to say it, but it was a bit of a eureka moment and I thought: ‘My god, that looks like a Rubens,'  the Guardian quotes Grosvenor as saying. The portrait was painted by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens around 1625 but was believed to have been lost. In reality, later artists painting over the background of the portrait—not to mention hundreds of years of dirt and grime—had obscured the work's identity as an original Rubens. It was confirmed as such through X-rays, cleaning, and scientific analysis of the wood it was painted on. The portrait is believed to have been bought by an art collector who owned the Pollok House in the late-1800s, the Telegraph reports. The man who authenticated it calls it a  rare addition to Ruben's portrait oeuvre.  Villiers was a minor noble elevated to duke by James I. Experts believe he was the king's lover, and a secret passageway connected the two men's bedrooms in one of James' residences. The restored portrait will be going on display in a Glasgow museum and art gallery this week.

The immediate priority—and progressives running for office in 2014 and 2016 should practice saying this out loud—is fixing Obamacare.  He's talking about more than tech trouble, however. They need to address what he sees as other fundamental flaws with the ACA, including  coverage gaps, the ways insurance companies will continue to exploit people and rip them off, and the potential for the cost burden on middle-class people to grow.  It's important that liberals acknowledge the problems and propose tangible solutions—like, say, federalizing Medicaid for those who live in states that haven't embraced ObamaCare—rather than simply getting defensive about it, he writes. Along those lines, conservative Rich Lowry writes in Politico that he's already tired of the  whining  he's hearing from Democrats about the new law and why things aren't working.

Created to improve on the company's already exceptional mattresses, some of which have lasted more than 100 years, it's now being updated a decade of research and work later. The new Vividus takes 320 hours to make and will set you back $149,000, reports Bloomberg. The bed consists of a wooden frame made of slow-growth northern Swedish pine; a box spring of pure steel springs with layers of cotton, wool batting, and horsehair; and a mattress pad that has its own layers of cotton, wool, and horsehair, each hair braided by hand and then unwound to maximize bounce. Why horsehair? Its strands are hollow, so it naturally wicks away moisture. Whether one of the world's most expensive beds is also the best is, of course, arguable, but the Bloomberg writer who tried one out writes,  I'm spoiled forever.

"(Dec 8, 2015  8:30 AM) While the rest of the world mourned Scott Weiland's death on Dec. 3, his former wife and kids simply continued the mourning they'd been doing for years, she notes in a heartbreaking letter in Rolling Stone.  December 3rd, 2015 is not the day Scott Weiland died,  Mary Forsberg Weiland writes on behalf of herself, 15-year-old Noah, and 13-year-old Lucy, the two children she had with the ex-Stone Temple Pilots frontman.  It is the official day the public will use to mourn him, and it was the last day he could be propped up in front of a microphone for the financial benefit or enjoyment of others. … The truth is, like so many other kids, [Noah and Lucy] lost their father years ago. What they truly lost on December 3rd was hope.  She adds that  this is the final step in our long goodbye to Scott  and that  maybe these last few years of separation were his parting gift to us—the only way he could think to soften what he knew would one day crush us deep into our souls.  Forsberg delves more into those years of separation, noting that although she doesn't want to  downplay Scott's amazing talent,  he was an absentee father and  once sweet Catholic boy  who went atheist and suffered from  multiple illnesses.   You might [say] ... 'We read that he loved spending time with his children and that he'd been drug-free for years!'  she writes.  In reality, what you didn't want to acknowledge was a paranoid man who couldn't remember his own lyrics and who was only photographed with his children a handful of times in 15 years of fatherhood.  But ultimately, she says, there's hope for others, if not for her family.

But polling guru Nate Silver has a more basic problem: The survey is useless, he writes on FiveThirtyEight.com. The survey never actually asks what soldiers think of DADT.

In many countries, demand will exceed supply by 40%, leaving one-third of the planet's population with only half the water they require to meet their basic needs. Agriculture will also likely suffer, as it currently uses 71% of the water supply. To blame? Climate change and population growth, scientists say. Focusing on simply increasing supply would cost around $200 billion per year, but this could be reduced to between $50 billion and $60 billion per year if demand is lowered at the same time, according to a water economist.

"(Aug 30, 2016  8:02 AM CDT) The study was published online in April, but the fallout is hitting now: University of Missouri-Columbia researchers are trying to identify  painless or non-invasive treatments for corneal injuries,  and devised a pilot study using six beagles to that end. The researchers wanted to study the effects of topical hyaluronic acid on corneal ulcers; under sedation, the dogs' left corneas were wounded (the New York Daily News reports this blinded them in that eye), with half the group then acting as control and half administered the acid. Per the study, posted by the Journal of Veterinary Opthamology,  No statistical differences ... were found between groups at any tested time point.  At its conclusion, the dogs were put down. The Beagle Freedom Project is up in arms over what it says was a flawed study from the outset. Beagle Freedom Project lawyer Dan Kolde tells the Riverfront Times the researchers acknowledged in the study itself that 12 dogs were needed per group to  detect a clinically significant difference in healing rates.  But using 24 dogs for the pilot study wasn't feasible so they went ahead with six. Had the acid worked, the study would have been written off due to population size, the Beagle Freedom Project maintains. At its completion, the animals were killed and their eyes removed and filed; the dog advocates say the animals should have been turned over for adoption. A rep for the university says in a statement,  Since dogs share similar eye characteristics with people, they are ideal candidates for corneal studies ... The animals were treated humanely and every effort was made to ensure dogs were as comfortable as possible.

That does not include the shooter, who went on a rampage spanning 16 crime scenes across five Nova Scotia communities from Saturday night until almost noon Sunday. The gunman also set fires that damaged or destroyed more than five structures and cars, the CBC reports. Among the victims killed were two nurses, Kristen Beaton and Heather O'Brien. Beaton, the mother of a 3-year-old son who was pregnant with a second child, was on her way to see a continuing care client when she was killed Sunday morning. Her husband says the province's failure to send out any emergency alerts doomed his wife. They didn't realize the gunman was wearing a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform and driving a police vehicle  until it was too late.   I would not have let my wife leave ... if I had that broadcast come across, that he was on the loose and he was driving an RCMP vehicle,  he says, per the CBC. He says the couple had been monitoring the situation Saturday night, but assumed it was under control by the following day when no alert was sent out, the Cape Breton Post reports. When he found out the gunman was still at large, he sent his wife a message warning her not to stop for anyone—but she was killed minutes later, never having had a chance to read it. Premier Stephen McNeil has been criticized for the lack of emergency alerts, but he says it's up to the RCMP to ask for such an alert and provide the details for it.  We had staff on hand in the morning to be able to do that,  he said.  But it was not requested.  Instead, the RCMP provided updates via Twitter.

But if the United States wants to secure those stockpiles, it will take about 75,000 troops, the Pentagon has told the Obama administration, reports the New York Times. The Times notes that there have been no indications that Hezbollah is trying to access the weapons; instead, it may have put its camps in close proximity to the weapons based on the belief that they wouldn't be bombed if the arms were nearby. More troubling is the  credible information that the Assad regime has been upgrading and expanding its chemical weapons arsenal,  said one analyst. New intelligence points to the export of North Korean missile technology to Syria. President Obama has said that Syria's chemical weapons could force him to  change my calculus  about getting involved militarily in that civil war.

The Santa Barbara Independent reports a pop-punk bassist is facing fraud charges and more than 30 years in prison over an alleged real estate scam. Prosecutors say Michael Davenport of The Ataris defrauded approximately 100,000 people in all 50 states and Washington DC out of $27 million through a company he founded called American Standard, according to NPR. The alleged scam worked like this: American Standard would advertise homes for sale for below-market value, usually on Craigslist; interested customers were made to pay $199 for a  listing of houses ; victims would later find out the homes on the list were either not for sale or didn't exist. American Standard told customers they  could purchase the houses by simply taking over the homeowners' mortgage payments  and hired employees who  spent most of their time fielding phone calls from angry customers and homeowners,  according to an indictment. Prosecutors say American Standard created impossible hoops to jump through if any customer demanded a refund. Davenport was arrested in December at the Bill and Hillary Clinton Airport in Arkansas with $104,000 in cash. He and American Standard salesperson Cynthia Rawlinson appeared in court Wednesday. They've been charged with wire fraud, mail fraud, and more. Davenport played with The Ataris from 1995 to 2004 and appeared with the band during a reunion tour in 2013, Rolling Stone reports.

As WBZ-TV reports, at least 73 revelers were arrested near the UMass Amherst campus yesterday in what a police spokeswoman called an  extremely disturbing and unsafe  annual exercise in debauchery called the  Blarney Blowout.

Highlights: Police in riot gear firing  paintball-style guns loaded with pepper spray,  fights, fireworks, and  thousands  of highly intoxicated people hurling beer cans and snowballs. Four cops were injured, notes the AP.  This is something that was created by the downtown bars in Amherst to grab ahold of the kids before they all left the campus,  says one UMass alum.

With more than 650 restaurants to Chipotle's 1,900-plus, Moe's Southwest Grill is now the new king of that particular category, according to a Harris Poll survey that queried nearly 100,000 consumers on more than 3,800 brands (including about 60 restaurants). And Chipotle, in the top spot for three years running before it fell victim to a slew of recent food-safety issues, didn't merely drop to second place—it plummeted to fifth, behind Taco Bell, Qdoba, and Baja Fresh. Competition in the category has been fierce, with Mexican eateries all trying to one-up each other in serving up healthier menu items with more selection. USA Today notes that Moe's is especially known for the ample variety of ingredients used to create build-your-own tacos, burritos, and other fare. But it's almost as if Chipotle gave up, debuting few new menu items and taking a halfhearted approach to alerting consumers to steps it's taken to address the hundreds of illnesses—the New York Post helpfully documents the norovirus, E. coli, and salmonella count—that have resulted from chowing down its food.  I just don't think they did enough to convince customers that Chipotle food was safe to eat,  an equity research analyst tells USA Today.

Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes, and some other information we have, leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired.  The suspects included two 18-year-olds who are alleged to have been preparing an attack at the ANZAC Day ceremony in Melbourne later this month. Another 18-year-old was arrested on weapons charges, and two other men, aged 18 and 19, were in custody and assisting police. All the arrests took place in Melbourne. ANZAC Day is the annual April 25 commemoration of the 1915 Gallipoli landings—the first major military action fought by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps during World War I. Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said at a separate news conference that the teens had links to Numan Haider, an 18-year-old who stabbed a Melbourne police officer as he tried to shake Haider's hand in September; the teen was subsequently shot dead.",Australia: 5 Teens Plotted Attack on WWI Ceremony,Australia: ____ Teens Plotted Attack on WWI Ceremony,5,Trans( Five ),1

"(Nov 20, 2017  8:03 AM) Two geologists may have spotted a surprisingly simple correlation that can help predict earthquakes—and if they're correct, the Earth is on track for an uptick in major quakes next year. The pair pored over a century's worth of a data on earthquakes and detected a pattern: When the Earth's rotation slows, as it does periodically, the slowdown is followed by an increase in quakes with a magnitude of 7 or greater, reports the Guardian. Their research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, has been well-received in the field, and it will be put to the test soon. The rotational slowdowns typically happen over five years, and the last began four years ago. Meaning, we can expect to see two to five more major earthquakes than normal in 2018, or 17 to 20, reports Science.  The Earth offers us a five-years' heads up on future earthquakes, which is remarkable,  says Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado, who detected the correlation with Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana. Exactly where the quakes will take place is fuzzier, but typically the increase shows up in regions along the Equator. The researchers aren't sure how to explain all this, but one theory is that it involves nearly imperceptible changes in the flow of molten iron in the Earth's core. That might be enough to slow down the Earth's spin a millisecond or two, a difference that can be measured by atomic clocks, and perhaps result in the release of vast amounts of energy underground. The cycle seems to take place about every three decades, writes geologist Trevor Nace at Forbes.

But that would be a mistake, as this crisis differs from 2008 in three major ways, writes Francesco Guerrera in the Wall Street Journal. Last time, the crisis was a bottom-up one, moving from  over-optimistic  homebuyers to Wall Street; this time, it's a top-down mess, originating with governments that businesses and financial institutions no longer trust. Second, the last time around the overabundance of cheap credit led to a  crash diet of deleveraging;  this time, everyone is sitting on mounds of cash and avoiding debt. Difference No. 3 concerns the solution: Last time, governments had to provide liquidity—sure, it cost $1 trillion and screwed over the average taxpayer, but it prevented a global depression. This time, however, there's plenty of liquidity, but no confidence in US and European governments.  In 2011, the financial world can't go cap in hand to the political capitals, hoping for a handout,  writes Guerrera.

The psychologists—identified in earlier reports as Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen—helped develop interrogation techniques for the CIA starting in 2002 and conducted many waterboardings themselves. They set up their own firm in 2005, and the Senate report says the CIA outsourced  virtually all aspects  of the program to it, paying the contractors $81 million before their $180 million contract was terminated in 2009, the Telegraph reports. The Senate report says neither man had specialized knowledge of al-Qaeda,  a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise.  Mitchell and Jessen—who accused agents who failed to use waterboarding and other  enhanced  techniques of running a  sissified  interrogation program—had experience not in real interrogations, but in running a Cold War-era training program on what captured airmen could expect from Communist interrogators, reports the New York Times. To devise their techniques, they drew on the  learned helplessness  theory concept developed by psychologist Martin Seligman.

Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith says the body of Kamille, who was last seen at an outdoor birthday party Oct. 12, was found in a dumpster at a landfill, NBC reports. Police say they plan to charge Patrick Stallworth and his girlfriend, Derick Brown, with kidnapping and capital murder. The suspects are not connected to Kamille's family, Smith says. Brown and Stallworth were arrested within 24 hours of the abduction. After the arrests, Stallworth was charged with seven counts of possession of child pornography, reports AL.com. Police say none of the images found on his phone were of Kamille. Stallworth, who had been freed on bail, was arrested again Tuesday night, WBRC reports. After he was first arrested, police said his Toyota SUV matched the description given by children who said a man had been handing out candy the night of the kidnapping. Brown remained in custody for a probation violation from a previous kidnapping involving her children.  We believe that this was something they thought about and acted upon. They saw an opportunity to take a young child and they did,  Smith told reporters.  Tonight our entire city is mourning. Kamille is gone,  said Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin.

There's little to envy now: The 24-year-old was on Wednesday sentenced to eight years for drug trafficking, in a case that involved $20 million of cocaine, an exotic cruise, and social media. Roberge and Isabelle Lagacé, 30, left Quebec and set sail on what by all appearances was a glamorous six-week cruise with stops in places like Bermuda, Peru, Chile, and Tahiti, which the women documented via Instagram (photos here). But when they arrived in Australia on Aug. 28, 2016, sniffer dogs unearthed 30 kilograms of cocaine in their first-class cabin, reports the CBC. More than twice that amount was found in André Tamine's quarters; the 65-year-old Montreal man had invited the women on the trip. The BBC reports it's the the biggest drug seizure Australia has made on a commercial boat or plane. Judge Catherine Traill had harsh words for Roberge's desire to have an impressive social media presence, reports news.au.com:  She was seduced by lifestyle and the opportunity to post glamorous Instagram photos from around the world. It is sad they seek to attain such a vacuous existence where how many likes they receive are their currency.  The Times of London cites a court affidavit in which Roberge admitted to being  a stupid young woman  concerned with superficial things. That may not have changed: The court heard that  her main hobby in prison is training at the gym.  Lagacé was sentenced to seven years and six months in November, and Tamine will be sentenced in October.

Doctors were prepping her for cataract surgery, injecting anesthesia, when they found and removed the lenses. The woman, said to be in her mid-60s, hadn't complained of eye irritation, but she explained after the contacts were removed that  she thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye,  one specialist trainee ophthalmologist tells Britain's Optometry Today.  When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses, she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable,  she adds. The cataract surgery was delayed so that bacteria that had accumulated in part of the eye could clear. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, could offer a warning not only to contact-wearing patients who go long stretches without eye exams, but to optometrists as well, since the clump of lenses hadn't caused an obvious infection. If such an incident did lead to an infection, a person could lose her sight, the specialist trainee warns. In this woman's case, doctors say her  deep-set eyes  could be part of the reason so many contacts—which were bound together by mucus, per Time—could have accumulated without notice.",Doctors Find 27 Contact Lenses in Woman's Eye,Doctors Find ____ Contact Lenses in Woman's Eye,27,Copy( 27 ),0

But you might be right, and researchers in Britain are currently planning to test that theory. They’re about to spend 10 years and millions of dollars trying to build the Babbage Analytical Machine, a massive punch card computer dreamed up by eccentric mathematician Charles Babbage in the 1830s, the New York Times reports. Babbage never built the analytical machine, and experts have spent years arguing about whether it would have worked. Complicating matters: Babbage was constantly tinkering with his design, so there’s no single blueprint to follow. So a variety of plans will be posted online next year, with the public invited to sort through them and suggest which parts should be incorporated. Researchers will then build a computer model of the room-sized machine and—hopefully—construct it at the Science Museum in London.

Researchers looking at 1,656 married adults ranging in age from 57 to 85 have found there is eventually an uptick in the frequency with which couples have sex. What's more, those in first marriages are having more sex than those who have remarried, report researchers from Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and Baylor University in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior. However frequently or infrequently couples were engaging in sex, marriage order didn't appear to influence emotional satisfaction or physical pleasure.  Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,  one researcher said in a Baylor University news release.  The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship—including in sexual aspects of [it].  While the results about the sex lives of one of the fastest growing groups in the US proved  intriguing,  particularly because it's a topic that has yet to be studied extensively, the researchers did point out that the 50-year second wind was a slight one, and that relatively few couples make it to 50 years to begin with, thus the sample size was small.

The unreleased video  appears to depict multiple officers working together to manufacture evidence,  according to the city's public defender. The news comes less than two weeks after a separate video was released seeming to show a police officer planting drugs in an alley while with two other officers.

It shows authorities repeatedly searching a vehicle during a November 2016 traffic stop but finding nothing, lawyer Debbie Katz Levi of the public defender's office tells WBFF. Later, she says, an officer looks like he places an item in the car. Two officers are under investigation, but Levi says the video shows  approximately six officers standing around while this suspected misconduct is taking place,  per CBS Baltimore. The public defender's office said it would not release the video because one of the suspects featured in the video isn't a client; meanwhile, charges were dropped Monday in this case.

Politico has an exclusive look from Chris Whipple into how the Bush administration ignored multiple detailed warnings from the CIA in the lead-up to the worst terrorist attack in US history. Whipple, along with Jules and Gedeon Naudet, interviewed 12 former CIA directors for their documentary The Spymasters, which airs later this month on Showtime. The conversations cover everything from torture to lethal drone strikes to the murky world of assassinations, and, of course, what was done—what could have been done—to prevent 9/11. Whipple writes that the warnings delivered to the Bush administration were more specific than previously known. Former CIA director George Tenet says he and Black pitched a plan to the Bush team in the spring of 2001 that would have launched a paramilitary operation in Afghanistan to neutralize al-Qaeda. The administration wasn't interested. Black says the Bush team  just didn't get  it.  I think they were mentally stuck,  he says.  They were used to terrorists being Euro-lefties—they drink champagne by night, blow things up during the day.  In July, they met with Condoleezza Rice and emphatically warned her the country needed  to go on a wartime footing  immediately. Again nothing happened.

His caretakers didn't like it, because they felt it belittled his situation, explains a feature in the California Sunday Magazine. That situation, however, was short on essential details: The only thing authorities knew about the young man is that he sustained a serious head injury when a truck with immigrants from Mexico crashed on the US side of the border. He wound up in a San Diego hospital and then in a nursing home in Coronado—and he lay there for 16 years known officially as Sixty-Six Garage. Over the years, the quest to identify the silent man slowly gained steam, thanks largely to a woman—a total stranger—who learned of his fate while visiting one of her own relatives in the hospital and made it her mission to see him reunited with his family. As she spread the word, thousands of Mexican families reached out in the hope that the man might be their missing son, brother, or cousin. (Members of one family were certain of it until DNA tests proved otherwise.) Finally, the mystery was solved when the case gained so much attention that  people with power  wanted it solved, writes Brooke Jarvis.

Of the 1.6 million veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, a hefty 45% are applying for injury-related compensation, well up from the estimated 21% who filed for help after the Gulf War in the 1990s. Almost one-third have been granted disability so far. And those applying for benefits in the last year claimed as many as 14 ailments—a huge jump from the average of four among Vietnam War vets and two among those who fought in Korea. The increased percentage of disability filings is reflective of improvements in battlefield care and body armor, which are allowing soldiers to survive what would have once been fatal injuries. Of new veterans who have sought VA care, more than 1,600 have lost a limb, 156 are blind, and thousands more are disfigured by injuries, with 200 possibly needing face transplants.

It's also a stunning amount for the stylist—identified by the BBC only as  Olivier B,  required to be on call 24/7 and Hollande's travel companion on most of his foreign junkets—when noted next to base salaries for European Parliament members, who just received a raise in January to about $9,150 a month. A source who talks to the Express appears to defend Mr. B's compensation by noting that the hairstylist has had to sell his personal salon to tend to Hollande, and that frequent trips have even caused him to  [miss] the birth of his children.  Still, most other reaction has been cutting, with mane-centric memes flowing aplenty, many accompanied by the #CoiffeurGate hashtag and some even floating the idea of balding candidates for the next election to save taxpayer money, News.com.au reports.

Lately, one of the only foods he would eat was a Star Wars-themed pasta dinner made by Kraft—and when his parents realized it was a limited edition and had trouble re-stocking their cupboards, the British Columbia couple put out a call on social media asking if anyone could help them track more boxes down. Little did they know their plea would go viral, the Toronto Star reports. Even William Shatner got in on the action, tweeting at Kraft,  can you possibly help?  with an explanation of what the family needed, CTV reports. The result? More than 500 boxes have been given to the family over the past week. Real Canadian Superstores shipped 411 of the boxes, but individuals have sent some too, many people including special messages with the pasta dinners. The family has also heard from others whose children have similar struggles and who have offered advice and encouragement, says Everett's dad, who calls the experience  magical.  And when the Star Wars dinners inevitably run out again? Everett has said he might agree to try other versions of the pasta dinner.","6-Year-Old Autistic Boy Will Only Eat One Thing, Something Amazing Happens","____-Year-Old Autistic Boy Will Only Eat One Thing, Something Amazing Happens",6,Copy( 6 ),0

About 200 relatives of missing jet passengers took 10 workers hostage for nearly 11 hours at the Lido Hotel, expressing their  dissatisfaction  over what they heard, according to a statement from the airline. Reports differ on what angered them: A Kuala Lumpur-based website, Malaysian Digest, says they lost it when told that debris washed up on an Australian shore was not from flight 370. According to Australia's News Network, they grew heated when a Malaysian official didn't attend the briefing. Either way, airline officials were kept at the hotel while dozens of family members went to the Malaysian embassy and protested. The hostages went free just before 2am, and the only damage was a kick to the knee received by Malaysian Airlines' security supervisor. Chinese families have been complaining bitterly for weeks about the airline's handling of the search, which they call incompetent and secretive. In an odd development, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told CNN yesterday that he just learned about a plane picked up by his country's radar on the night flight 370 disappeared.

The news emerged at an emotional press conference Friday in Rochester, New York.  I never thought I would see this day, and now it's here,  said Wendy's mother, Marlene Jerome.  I just wish my husband had been alive to see this.  Suspect Timothy Williams, 56, was arrested Wednesday at his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and charged with second-degree murder, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. Officials relied on DNA taken from semen during an autopsy, but a 1999 search on the FBI's DNA database came up cold. Then came a  familial DNA  test. Approved by New York law in 2017, familial DNA searches can identify the suspect's family members and generate new leads. In this case, officials say Williams lived near Wendy when she vanished on Thanksgiving Day 1984 while delivering a birthday card to her closest friend. The 14-year-old died  from massive blunt force trauma as well as multiple lacerations about her body,  said Rochester Police Capt. Frank Umbrino at the press conference, per 13WHAM.  Honestly the extent of the injuries are too horrendous to talk about here. What it is safe to say is that Wendy did put up a fight.

According to an NPR and Pro Publica report, the organization claims to have provided 130,000 people with homes but in fact built only six permanent homes. The Red Cross says land-rights issues hindered its efforts, but reporters found other problems, like lengthy bureaucratic delays, changes in staffing, and a full year in which nothing happened.  They never had a real plan for what they wanted to do in housing,  says Lee Malany, who was in charge of the organization's Haiti shelter program. He says Red Cross leadership, including CEO Gail McGovern, seemed more concerned with publicity than project details. NPR and Pro Publica look at the struggling Haitian community of Campeche, part of a Port-au-Prince neighborhood where the Red Cross promised to spent $24 million on rebuilding—but residents say it never happened. The Red Cross reacted with an email that accused reporters of  creating ill will in the community, which may give rise to a security incident.

Most recently, 74-year-old Tsuwa Suzuki was found dead in the Akita prefecture this weekend in an attack so severe that authorities could barely identify her. She was apparently killed while picking edible plants in a mountain forest. Three men, one in his sixties and two in their seventies, were also killed in the same area in separate incidents while picking bamboo shoots. Authorities responded to Suzuki's death by sending out a search team and fatally shooting a 4-foot-high, 154-pound female Asiatic black bear just 20 yards from where the woman was killed, Asahi Shimbun reports. Local vet Takeshi Komatsu says there may be only one perpetrator behind the maulings.  After tasting human flesh (for the first time), the bear may have realised that it can eat them,  Komatsu says. Yet sightings of black Asiatic bears and brown bears have soared in northern Japan this year, surpassing 1,200, which already doubles last year's count. An unusually high crop of beechnuts may have boosted the bear population by improving the nutrition of mother bears, Yomiuri Shimbun reports. Meanwhile, authorities are advising people to take precautions when walking around the mountains.

"(Aug 17, 2015  3:30 PM CDT) A veteran US astronaut says the Cold War ended peacefully because extra-terrestrials visited Earth and kept nuclear war from happening, Fox News reports. Edgar Mitchell, who flew on Apollo 14 and was the sixth man to walk on the moon, says his version of events is based on military sources. Air Force officers  told me UFOs were frequently seen overhead and often disabled their missiles,  he tells the Mirror.  Other officers from bases on the Pacific coast told me their [test] missiles were frequently shot down by alien spacecraft.  Those UFOs were allegedly spotted over New Mexico's White Sands military facility, where the first nuclear bomb detonation occurred in 1945. Mitchell himself grew up in New Mexico, not far from White Sands and the infamous Roswell site.  You don't know the area like I do,  he adds.  White Sands was a testing ground for atomic weapons—and that's what the extraterrestrials were interested in. They wanted to know about our military capabilities.  Of course, doubters aren't hard to find. Nick Pope, who once conducted UFO research for Britain's Ministry of Defence, says Mitchell is  an honorable and truthful man,  but the  idea that peace-loving extraterrestrials are here to warn humanity about our destructive ways  is common among New Age UFO lovers.

His ordeal began Sept. 20 in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, where the overcrowded ferry capsized about 160 feet from its destination, Ukara Island.

The finding is the earliest such proof of cheese-making, and it would have been a huge innovation in the late Neolothic period, explains the LA Times. For one thing, most adults were lactose-intolerant at the time, and turning milk into cheese would make it easier to digest and thus be an important source of food.

Now, 173 years later, the Irish are repaying the favor by helping Native American tribes hit hard by the pandemic, reports Time.

His identity may finally have come to light after two mushroom pickers say they found the camp of a man with a  dirty face and large beard  in a heavily wooded, remote location in the Maremma region, the Local reports. The mysterious stranger, a man in his mid- to late 40s, told the men and a local forest ranger they alerted that his name was Carlos, he was from Spain, and he'd been shacked up in the wilderness since 1997. And sure enough, the ID papers he brought out to show them (the Local mentions a passport, the Telegraph a university library card) listed him as Carlos Sanchez Ortiz de Salazar, a young doctor who had reportedly gone missing from his home in Seville in 1996 during a bout with depression and eventually been pronounced dead in 2010.  I don't want to live among people,  the man reportedly told the hikers.  Now that you have found me, I need to get out of here.

Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical biography about the first US treasury secretary won 11 Tonys, just short of breaking the 12-Tony record held by The Producers. Jeffrey Seller, producer of Hamilton, quoted the show's lyrics when accepting the best musical crown.  Look around, look around. How lucky we are to be alive right now,  he said. Hamilton went into the night with 16 nominations and, in addition to taking the musical award, won best score, best book, direction, orchestration, choreography, and best featured actor and actress statuettes for Renee Elise Goldsberry and Daveed Diggs. Leslie Odom Jr., who plays Aaron Burr, won best actor in a musical. The show earlier won awards for costume and lighting but lost scenic design to She Loves Me, meaning Hamilton couldn't break the record haul by The Producers. Still, few shows get introduced by a sitting president, as Barack and Michelle Obama did for the performance by the show's cast.

"(Feb 17, 2012  1:26 AM) Designer Marc Jacobs is flouting fashion industry recommendations by sending 14-year-old models down his catwalk.  I do the show the way I think it should be, not the way somebody tells me it should be,  Jacobs told the New York Times after his Manhattan presentation.  There is no controversy.  Health initiative guidelines set by the Council of Fashion Designers of America—which includes Jacobs on its board—recommend that runway models be at least 16 years old. The age limit has been touted as a sign of progress in an industry plagued by anorexia.  The industry's hiring of prepubescent-appearing teenage girls as models of adult clothing sets an unrealistic standard; the curves that define the female figure are absent,  said council president Diane von Furstenburg. Models who attempt to maintain a child's body into adulthood  run the risk of eating disorders,  she warned. The girls in Jacobs' show, Thairine Garcia and Ondria Hardin, are represented by Ford Models, which apparently also ignores the council's recommendations. While Ford supports the idea of health initiatives, it hasn't agreed to an age limit, reports ABC. Even the council itself said it's ultimately up to a designer. What's curious is why Jacobs decided to use the girls in designs that largely covered them up, and shadowed them with large hats. Maybe it's because the hats, as the Times points out, were  Dr.Seuss-style.  The  cleaning staff could have been under those hats, and nobody would have been the wiser,  quips writer Eric Wilson.","Marc Jacobs Sends Girls, 14, Down Runway","Marc Jacobs Sends Girls, ____, Down Runway",14,Copy( 14 ),0

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence—including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard—were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there  to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,  reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO.

He ran inside and found two little girls, ages 3 and 5, and helped them out of the house. That was in 1951, and the Canadian man always wondered what happened to them. Then, this November, Malone moved into the house next door to Margaret Fowler—and while trading stories about their lives one day, they realized Fowler was one of the two little girls Malone had saved 65 years ago. He has since also been reunited with the other little girl, Fowler's sister Barbara Earle, and the trio told their story to the CBC's St. John's Morning Show this week.  She just looked at me and nearly fainted,  Malone says of the moment Fowler told the story of the little girls he'd saved. He found Fowler first, but she refused to leave because her little sister was still somewhere in the house.

Icahn will use his super PAC to press Congress to pass legislation that stops US companies from moving their profits overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates — a practice known as  inversions.  American corporations—including Apple, one of his own biggest investments—are holding more than $2.2 trillion abroad, Icahn said. The investor laid out his plans in a letter posted on his website, which he said he also delivered to lawmakers. He said in a CNBC interview Wednesday that he's taking action because he's tired of Congress dodging the issue.  These guys are unwilling to compromise,  he said of lawmakers.

Icahn joins other billionaires, including environmentalist Tom Steyer and gun-control advocate Michael Bloomberg, in using super PACs to tackle a single policy issue.

The Week quips you'll need to  sell that old Renoir on the wall, quickly marry an oligarch ... or ask Mike Bloomberg for a loan  to attend. Republican officials point out that past presidents, including President Obama, also held expensive fundraisers with elite donors. But some are raising eyebrows, pointing to Trump's 2016 vow to  drain the swamp  against practices like these in DC, as they could make candidates beholden to donors. About 30 people are expected to attend Saturday's event, bringing in at least $10 million for the 2020 reelection war chest for Trump and the GOP. Although it's not clear what's on the menu for this particular happening, past fundraisers usually include photo ops with the president and Trump's favorite foods (including strip steak and vanilla ice cream). Trump is said to be  highly engaged, conversational, and charming  at such events, per past attendees.

"(Oct 8, 2019  5:10 AM CDT) A relative who arrived at a home in a Boston suburb Monday morning to take children to school made a horrifying find downstairs: The body of their mother, 40-year-old Deirdre Zaccardi. After the relative called 911, police found the bodies of the family's three children—11-year-old Alexis and 9-year-old twins Nathaniel and Kathryn—elsewhere in the Abington home, along with that of father Joseph Zaccardi, 43, the Boston Globe reports. All five had been shot. At a press conference Monday, Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz did not disclose whether the deaths were a murder-suicide, but said the community is not in danger. The family did not have any known history of domestic issues, Cruz told reporters.  A crime occurred in that building and three little children are gone forever as a result of this,  Cruz said.  This is a horrible, horrible event,  he added.  I think when something like this, unimaginable like this happens, there’s always going to be more questions than there are going to be answers.  The New York Post reports that Joseph Zaccardi was a struggling children's book author, whose books included  All Mixed Up  and  Sammy the Once Sad Caterpillar.  On Facebook, he listed his employment status as  Unemployed and Going Crazy,  according to the Post.

The Italian company pulled a black balaclava-style sweater from its stores and website and apologized  for the offense caused,  after social media users said the design resembled blackface. The $890 wool sweater, released in the first week of Black History Month, covered the bottom half of the face, with a cutout lined in thick red for the mouth, per NBC News.  What racist at Gucci thought this was a good idea?  reads a typical response tweet.  Come to be offended by the racism, stay to be offended by the price,  adds Forward columnist Molly Jong-Fast.

"(Aug 1, 2014  8:20 PM CDT) House Republicans revived their bill on the US-Mexico border crisis in dramatic fashion today, passing it on a near party-line vote after winning over conservatives with tough new provisions that could threaten deportation for hundreds of thousands of immigrants already working in this country legally. President Barack Obama condemned the Republican action and said he'd act unilaterally, as best he could. A day after GOP leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat, tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $694 million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program created by Obama granting work permits to immigrants brought here illegally as kids. The second bill also seemed designed to prevent the more than 700,000 people who've already gotten work permits under the program from renewing them, ultimately making them subject to deportation. The spending bill passed 223-189 late today, with only four Republicans voting  no  and one Democrat voting  yes.  A vote on the second measure was expected later in the night.  It's dealing with the issue that the American people care about more than any other, and that is stopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country,  said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.  And we got to yes.  But Obama said no:  They're not even trying to solve the problem,  the president said.

"(Mar 7, 2013  10:47 AM) More than 500 years after Spain expelled or forcibly converted its once thriving Jewish population, the country has announced plans to allow descendents of those Sephardic Jews a fast-track to Spanish passports and citizenship, reports the BBC. In the 15th century, there were around 300,000 Jews in Spain, but in 1492 they were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Many of those who left went to North Africa or the Ottoman Empire; indeed, even today 90% of the 100,000 Jews in Turkey are descendents of Sephardic Jews. However, the conversos, those who converted to Christianity and stayed in Spain, were targeted heavily by the Inquisition.  In the long journey Spain has undertaken to rediscover a part of itself, few occasions are as moving as today,  said Spain's justice minister when he made his announcement in November. In the first month alone, there were 6,000 inquiries about regaining citizenship. However, the details of the new policy are still being worked out, and some have complained that the policy of return only applies to still practicing Jews, not to secular Jews or Christian converts. And Muslim groups have pointed out they were kicked out of Spain at the same time, but no one is inviting them back.","500 Years Later, Spain Invites Jews Back","____ Years Later, Spain Invites Jews Back",500,Copy( 500 ),0

Nicholas Beauchene, 26, has been charged with one count of delay, secretion, or detention of mail and one count of obstruction of mail, NJ.com reports. He had an appearance in a federal court Wednesday, where assistant US Attorney Sara F. Merin said there was no evidence the mail-dumping was politically motivated. Beauchene allegedly dumped mail from two different routes on two different days. Authorities say the mail was recovered on Oct. 2 and Oct. 5. Beauchene faces up to 5.5 years in prison if convicted of both charges. Authorities say Beauchene—who started working for the US Postal Service in July and resigned Wednesday—was the only carrier on the two mail routes involved. He allegedly dumped a total of 1,875 pieces of mail in dumpsters in North Arlington and West Orange, CNN reports. The dumped mail, which included hundreds of election flyers, was returned to the  mail stream for delivery to its intended recipients,  authorities say.

"(Jul 6, 2012  11:51 AM CDT) Chinese police arrested 802 people on suspicion of child trafficking and rescued 181 children in a major operation spanning 15 provinces, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security said today. The recent operation broke up two trafficking rings and led to the arrests of the ring leaders. The national operation was set up earlier this year after local police spotted trafficking signs, including frequent appearances of out-of-town pregnant women, in a clinic in north China's Hebei province. State media reported that parents wishing to sell their babies could find potential buyers through the clinic. One of its doctors was among those arrested. Trafficking in children is a big problem in China. Its strict one-child policy—which limits most urban couples to one child and rural couples to two if their first-born is a girl—has driven a thriving market in babies, especially boys because of a traditional preference for male heirs. Many trafficked babies are abducted, but some are sold by families who are too poor to care for a baby or do not want a girl. State media report that a baby girl can fetch $4,800 to $8,000 and that a baby boy sells for $11,200 to $12,800.",802 Busted in Chinese Child Trafficking Rings,____ Busted in Chinese Child Trafficking Rings,802,Copy( 802 ),0

The Mint is trying to figure out how to produce coins more cheaply without sparing our change's quality and durability, or altering its size and appearance—and its initial findings aren't too encouraging. A 400-page report presented last week to Congress outlines nearly two years of trials conducted at the Mint in Philadelphia, where a variety of metal recipes were put through their paces in the massive facility's high-speed coin-making machinery. The test stampings were then examined for color, finish, resistance to wear and corrosion, hardness, and magnetic properties. Evaluations of 29 different alloys concluded that none met the ideal list of attributes. The Treasury Department concluded that additional study was needed before it could endorse any changes, and more test runs with different alloys are likely in the coming year. Neat tidbit: When testing possible new metal combinations, the Mint uses  nonsense dies,  images that don't exist on legal tender ... and a bonneted Martha Washington is apparently a favorite subject.

China retains only 5% of the global export market—the US and Russia hold 31% and 27%, respectively—but a new report by the Swedish International Peace Research Institute shows China's exports of major arms jumped 143% between the period of 2005-2009 and that of 2010-2014.  One of the concerns about China is not just that they are modernizing—we don't anticipate a conflict with China, certainly—but [that] they export,  the chief weapons' buyer for the Pentagon warned Congress last year, per the Wall Street Journal.

China also sells weapons to  niche markets  that the West snubs, including North Korea and Iran, the AP notes; still, the Journal reports the majority of China's exports go to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Burma.

Three women died at the scene, while a fourth died at a local hospital; all were bridesmaids, reports CBS News. The bride was in critical condition.  They weren't screaming or shouting,  a man who stopped to help tells Newsday.  They're sitting in the back and they saw what happened directly in front of them.  He said he didn't see anyone in the middle seat,  but I realize now, [that was] because the front end of the pickup truck was embedded into the limo. They had to die instantly. There was no noise.  A law enforcement official said the pickup slammed into the side of the limo. The crash occurred around 6pm along Route 48 in Cutchogue, on the North Fork of Long Island. Limousines are common in the area for people visiting the numerous wineries there. Flatley said the driver of the pickup ran from the crash scene, but was caught and arrested and faces a driving while intoxicated charge. His identity was not immediately released and he remained under police guard at a local hospital.

However, it provided no explanation for why he allegedly maneuvered around a vehicle barrier early Saturday evening and plowed into tourists and vendors on the popular walkway along the Pacific. Italian newlywed Alice Gruppioni, 32, who was on her honeymoon, was killed, and 16 other people were injured.

Police say Wesley Mathews was charged with felony injury to a child after visiting a police station with his attorney and giving them a different version of events, the Dallas Morning News reports.  He provided an alternate series of events from what he had previously given us,  said police spokesman Kevin Perlich, who did not elaborate. Police say the body found in a culvert less than a mile from the Mathews home in the Dallas suburb of Richardson is  most likely  that of Sherin Mathews, though they are waiting for confirmation. Mathews, who was out on bail on a charge of child endangerment, is being held on $1 million bond on the new charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the AP reports. Police say more charges—and more arrests—are possible. Mathews has told police that Sherin, who was adopted from India last year, was on a special diet and was being punished for not drinking her milk. He did not report her missing for five hours and police are seeking surveillance footage of a vehicle they believe left the home between 4am and 5am on Oct. 7, the night the girl disappeared.

"(Mar 2, 2018  3:17 AM) A wedding photographer whose business was ruined by one of the most vengeful brides since Kill Bill has been awarded almost $90,000 in damages. A judge in Canada decided that bride Emily Liao was motivated by malice when she launched a furious online campaign against company Amara Wedding and owner Kitty Chan, the BBC reports. Judge Andrew Weatherill said that after a dispute over the quality of pre-wedding photographs, Liao spent a year attacking the company on English and Chinese-language forums, blogs, and social media platforms, saying it was  a major scam shop and deceitful photography mill business engaged in extortion, dishonesty, unfair practices, bait and switch, and other dirty tactics.  Chan says her formerly successful wedding services firm in Richmond, BC, relied on word of mouth within the Chinese community and it closed down in January 2017 after business collapsed. Weatherill, who described the case as  an example of the dangers of using the Internet to publish information without proper regard for its accuracy,  said Liao had  failed to prove that her displeasure was justified.  He ordered her to pay damages for wrecking the business with her campaign to harm it in an  egregious, accusatory, and vitriolic manner.

The Dow plummeted more than 1,800 points at the open, more than 7%, and the benchmark S&P 500 also fell 7%, per MarketWatch. The steep decline triggered an automatic, 15-minute halt in trading at 9:35am, reports CNBC. When trading resumed, things stabilized, relatively speaking, with the Dow and S&P both down about 6% at 10am (roughly 1,600 points and 175, respectively). This brutal start comes after markets around the world plunged as well amid worsening coronavirus fears and a chaotic oil market. Monday's selloff was fueled in particular by plunging world oil prices, the result of a breakdown in negotiations between Saudia Arabia and Russia to prop them up amid weakening demand. The result is a  shocking all-out price war,  per CNBC.  The fear today is about a global recession,  Thomas Hayes of the Great Hill Capital hedge-management fund tells the Wall Street Journal.

The Senate voted 86-9 Monday to confirm Robert Wilkie as the 10th secretary of Veterans Affairs, filling a post that was previously occupied by David Shulkin. President Trump's original pick to replace Shulkin, White House physician Ronny Jackson, ended up withdrawing. NPR describes the 55-year-old Wilkie as a  safe pick  with a deep military background: He himself is a Navy veteran and active member of the Air Force reserves, and his father was seriously wounded while fighting in Vietnam. But the Washington Post reports what has in the past always been a unanimous vote—with senators looking to show bipartisan support for veterans—wasn't quite there for the first time. Bernie Sanders was in the nay category, with NPR reporting his vote was more a larger statement against any Trump administration moves to privatize the VA. But the AP reports the Wilkie did indeed vow not to privatize the VA. It calls the vote  a moment of respite from the sharp political divisions engulfing Trump's other nominees in the final months before congressional midterm elections.

The government said last year that more than 20 states were targeted by hackers believed to be Russian agents before the 2016 elections. But for many states, the calls Friday from the Department of Homeland Security were the first official confirmation of whether their states were on the list. States that said they were targeted include Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in three states said the attempts could be linked to Russia. The Wisconsin Election Commission, for example, said the state's systems were targeted by  Russian government cyber actors.  Federal officials said that in most of the 21 states, the targeting was preparatory activity such as scanning computer systems. The targets included voter registration systems but not vote tallying software. Officials said there were some attempts to compromise networks but most were unsuccessful.

"(Apr 22, 2015  4:00 PM CDT) That incredibly accurate atomic clock we heard about last year just upped its game. The JILA timepiece, created in a joint venture between the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado Boulder, received upgrades that now have it (in theory, at least) faithfully ticking away for a very, very long time—it reportedly won't lose or gain a second for 15 billion years, the Washington Post notes. In a study published in Nature Communications, the scientists behind the moving parts explain that they were able to significantly increase the clock's accuracy—it boasted a mere 200 million years of accuracy just six years ago—by better controlling the temperature of the strontium atoms used inside, among other factors. The newspaper spells out the process: An optical lattice is formed by  intense  lasers, trapping thousands of strontium atoms in a column, where they're prodded back and forth between two energy levels by a red laser (hence creating pendulum-like  ticks ). To make those ticks even more consistent and stable, scientists took into account how heat from the clock's surroundings affect the atoms and then cooled it down. Of course, a 2010 relativity study showed time goes by more slowly the closer someone is located to the Earth, so the Post boggles our already fragile minds with  the question of whether the whole Earth can really have one standard, super-accurate clock that speaks for us all  and asks,  Should we tell time by our highest points or our lowest?

FEMA canceled the contract 20 days later, having received only 50,000 of the 18.5 million meals that were due at the time.

North Carolinians can now send in absentee ballots by mail for any reason (they'll be able to cast their vote in person starting Oct. 20).

The deal—reportedly coordinated by a Turkish Islamic aid group—will also involve the release of more than 2,000 held by Bashar al-Assad's regime, Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Anadolu said a group of people held in the Syrian Interior Ministry building in Damascus had been released and were escorted onto buses. The group included women and children, it said, but gave no further details. Iran is one of Assad's main backers and the hostages were a major bargaining chip for opposition factions trying to bring down his regime. Rebels accused the Iranian captives, who were kidnapped outside Damascus in August, of links to Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, but Iran has denied the claims and described the hostages as pilgrims visiting Shiite religious sites.

"(Apr 7, 2011  2:37 AM CDT) Pity poor Twitter. After recently raising $200 million on a $3.7 billion valuation, it doesn't want to cough up a city payroll tax. So the company is on its way to winning a major tax break from struggling San Francisco after threatening to leave its city digs for the 'burbs. The exemption on the tax—which levies a 1.5% charge on worker compensation—is about to be granted for new employees hired in the next six years at larger companies in a specific downtown area. It's clearly aimed at Twitter, which could hire as many as 2,000 workers in that time, saving the company an estimated $22 million. Twitter had hoped for a total exemption on all workers, not just newbies, for eight years. Supporters say the move, which will likely be finalized next week, is an incentive to keep firms in a city running out of money and slashing services.  The bottom line is, if we don't do this we will not have their payroll to tax. Companies will leave,  a city supervisor tells the San Francisco Chronicle. Critics characterize it as corporate welfare and a form of extortion.  If we're going to allow a company to threaten to leave, and give them a tax break so they don't, we're setting a really bad precedent,  said another supervisor.  Part of social responsibility is paying taxes.  The real rub is in Twitter's marketing itself as a good-guy business, notes Gawker.

The analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data found that a total of around 6 million people were affected, and the problem was found in every state. Even more worryingly, almost 200 of the water systems ignored federal rules about notifying consumers of high lead levels, which are caused by lead plumbing fixtures, as well as the old lead service lines that still supply more than 7 million homes in the US.

"(May 29, 2017  8:00 AM CDT) British cops are investigating whether a serial killer locked up for nearly four decades could be behind two cold cases in Sweden. Police in the southern Swedish city of Malmö say a passenger ferry list shows that  Yorkshire Ripper  Peter Sutcliffe was apparently in the area in September 1980 when the body of 26-year-old Teresa Thörling was found dumped at a construction site, Kvällsposten reports via the Local. At the time, that murder was linked to the brutal killing one month earlier of Gertie Jensen, 31, in Gothenburg. Swedish sleuth Bo Lundqvist confirmed to the newspaper that Malmö cops told UK authorities in 1981 that the truck driver may have been in the city around the time of the murders. That lead went nowhere after Interpol reported—wrongly, it turned out—that Sutcliffe was not there. Interpol later corrected that version in a telex that apparently wasn't spotted by UK cops until last year, when a cold case squad took another look at the two unsolved murders. They have another major clue to pursue: a hair recovered from Thörling's body that could identify her killer. Lundqvist confirmed that UK cops have asked his department for help.  They wanted answers,  he tells Kvällsposten, including forensic evidence and  whether Sutcliffe was named in any investigations.  Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, per the Guardian, after being sentenced to life in prison in 1981 for the murders of 13 women in the UK in the late 1970s, and the attempted murders of seven others. Although the statute of limitations has lapsed for the two murders in Sweden, Sutcliffe could be prosecuted under UK law.

It looks like there are four possibilities: no one, Jayme herself, the woman she approached asking for help, or the couple who then called 911. The FBI in late October ponied up $25,000 for anyone providing information leading to the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl's rescue, and the Jennie-O Turkey Store, which employed her parents, matched that amount.

"(Aug 24, 2015  4:25 PM CDT) With many big cities upping the minimum wage, restaurant owners have to contend with higher labor costs—which has led some to abandon the practice of tipping in favor of raising menu prices or adding a mandatory service fee. At Dirt Candy, a Manhattan eatery, a 20% administrative fee is added to the bill in lieu of tipping—and servers are paid $25 per hour. (New York will require tipped workers be paid at least $7.50 starting at the end of this year.)  I think that restaurants will have to do this,  the owner tells the New York Times.  How else do you compensate for this extra money you’ll have to pay?  Plus, while tips are not shared with those who work in the kitchen, the revenue from higher prices and fees can often be shared with all employees.  We saw there was a fundamental inequity in our restaurants where the people who worked in the kitchen were paid about half as much as the people who worked with customers in front of the house,  explains the co-owner of Ivar's, a Seattle restaurant that raised prices 21% and eliminated tipping after the first stage of the city's $15 minimum wage took effect. Though some restaurateurs worry that servers will be put off by the idea of no tips, a server at a San Francisco restaurant that also pays $25 per hour says she earns as much as she always did at her new rate of pay—but now she earns the same amount per shift even if a night is particularly slow. Another concern is that diners simply aren't ready for the change. At Ivar's, credit card slips now include this line:  If you INSIST on leaving a tip, write it here.

JS and MS, as they’re identified in court documents, are suing the state after a Schaumburg school district barred their 11-year-old daughter from using a medical cannabis patch and cannabis oil drops to regulate seizures resulting from chemotherapy treatment for leukemia, reports USA Today. Though medical marijuana was legalized in the state in 2014, consumption or possession on public school property remains outlawed. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the couple argue the statute not only makes it hard for their daughter to attend school—putting them at risk of violating a state law requiring that kids attend—but also violates her right to due process, reports the Chicago Tribune.

A few days after Christmas, Justin and Tori Englehardt discovered someone had destroyed every beehive on their Wild Hill Honey farm, the Des Moines Register reports. According to the BBC, the destruction of the 50 hives in Sioux City, Iowa, caused 500,000 bees to freeze to death. The Englehardts called the vandalism  completely senseless.  On Wednesday, police arrested two boys—age 12 and 13—in connection with the crime. The boys, who were found through tips from the public, have been charged with three felonies—criminal mischief, agricultural animal facilities offenses, and burglary—as well as misdemeanor possession of burglar's tools. The Englehardts estimated the damage to their hives at $60,000 and thought the act of vandalism would put their farm out of business, the Sioux City Journal reports. But an online fundraiser started by a friend raised more than $30,000 to allow Wild Hill Honey to start again in the spring.  It was amazing, and we are deeply grateful for all of the contributions,  Justin Engelhardt says. He has a thought about why the death of their 500,000 bees struck a chord with donors:  Bees are critical and people are conscious of the fact that bees are having a hard time right now and facing some real challenges.",Boys Face Felony Charges After 500K Bees Killed,Boys Face Felony Charges After ____K Bees Killed,500,"Paraphrase( 500,000 , K )",1

Retail sales rose 1.1% last month, the Commerce Department said today. That followed a 1.2% increase in August, which was revised slightly higher. Both were the largest gains since October 2010. Sales rose in most major categories. Electronics and appliances surged 4.5%, in part because of the release of the new iPhone. Sales at auto dealers increased 1.3%. Building materials, garden supplies, furniture, and clothing sales all increased, too. Economists said the September increase should help drive slightly stronger growth in the July-September quarter. But they cautioned that some of the jump was driven by the release of the iPhone 5.  This shouldn't be considered the start of a consumer revival,  said one.  This is a one-time boost that will be reversed in the coming months.  Some of the increases were also driven by higher prices. Gas station sales also rose 2.5%, and food sales increased 1.2%. The recent drought may have driven some food prices higher, economists noted.

The sweetest sound was the click of those handcuffs,  a relative tells the AP of the moment Nouman Raja was taken away as the first Florida police officer convicted in an on-duty shooting in 30 years, per WPLG. The former Palm Beach Gardens police officer was found guilty of manslaughter and attempted first-degree murder in the 2015 shooting death of Jones, a black musician whose SUV containing a $10,000 drum set had broken down on a roadside. Raja showed no reaction despite a possible sentence of life in prison, per NBC News. Over an eight-day trial, prosecutors described how he'd arrived around 3am at the side of an Interstate 95 exit ramp in plainclothes and an unmarked van, never identifying himself as a cop. Confronted, 31-year-old Jones drew a legally owned handgun he'd bought for protection in his job as a housing inspector, apparently thinking he was being robbed. Raja, 41, said James had pointed the gun at him, causing him to fire six shots. The safety was activated on Jones' gun when it was found 41 yards from his body, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel. While noting a bullet through his heart and lungs had ultimately killed the musician, a medical examiner said that a bullet in Jones' right arm had to have come as he was running away. Jones' father said he was  filled with joy  at the verdict, per the Sun Sentinel.  Regardless of how many bad cops there is, the truth will always prevail,  he said. Fired less than a month after the shooting, Raja has been under house arrest since charges were laid in 2016. Sentencing is set for April 26.

Yahoo News reports senators Rand Paul and John McCain are having a bit of a tiff this week after McCain called Paul out on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. McCain was seeking a vote on a Senate bill—expected to be widely supported—in favor of Montenegro's efforts to join NATO. According to Politico, 23 of 28 NATO member nations have already voted in favor of Montenegro joining—but Russia is strenuously opposed to it. McCain claimed anyone who didn't support the bill would be  carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin.  After Paul blocked a vote on the bill and left the Senate, McCain went further, accusing Paul directly of  working for Vladimir Putin.  Paul responded to McCain's comments Thursday, and he didn't pull any punches.  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged,  Paul said, adding that McCain  makes a really, really strong case for term limits.  And he accused McCain of possibly being  past his prime.  Paul justified his opposition to the Montenegro bill by saying that the US military has enough on its plate without possibly having to support the small country, the Hill reports. He also claimed NATO membership isn't supported by a majority of Montenegro citizens. Paul said being called a traitor for opposing the bill might be  a little over the top.

People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are four to seven times more likely to commit a crime than their peers, Swedish researchers find. The study, which the AP calls  provocative,  points to a need for patients to stay on drugs like Ritalin and Adderall beyond childhood. Researchers used Swedish national health and court records to track 16,000 men and 10,000 women with ADHD aged 15 and older, comparing each subject with 10 similar people without the disorder. Over four years, some 37% of men with ADHD were convicted of committing a crime, versus just 9% of men without the disorder; for women, the rates were 15% and 2%, respectively. Medication appeared to cut the risk of committing a crime by 32% among men and 41% among women. Some 4,000 of the 23,000 crimes studied were violent, but medication reduced all types of crime.  It's not necessarily just the medication  that's cutting crime, a researcher notes: People on meds are also getting other kinds of treatment, including counseling.",People With ADHD 4x More Likely to Commit a Crime,People With ADHD ____x More Likely to Commit a Crime,4,Trans( four ),1

David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt posed as executives of a fake bioresearch company and filmed their conversations with Planned Parenthood officials about obtaining fetal tissue. They posted the resulting videos in 2015 via the Center for Medical Progress, accusing Planned Parenthood of being in the business of illegally harvesting and selling organs from aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood says the videos were deceptively edited. Now, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has charged the pair with filming 14 people without their permission, plus an additional count of conspiracy to invade privacy.  The right to privacy is a cornerstone of California’s Constitution, and a right that is foundational in a free democratic society,  said Becerra.  We will not tolerate the criminal recording of confidential conversations.  Daleiden called the charges  bogus  and tells the Washington Post that he and Merritt were engaged in  citizen journalism.  Similar charges against the pair in Texas were eventually dropped.

Over 20 other schools in Jefferson County, Colo., also restricted access Tuesday as officials investigated what they called a  credible threat,  the Denver Post reports. The FBI is leading the probe with help from the county sheriff and area police forces.  We too are taking this threat seriously,  Aurora police tweeted.  ...we are increasing police presence at our schools.

The move comes four days before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, which left 12 students and one teacher dead on April 20, 1999.

But Colorado schools are also seeing more lockdowns as students report more possible threats in the age of mass shootings:  It's become as routine as fire drills,  a Denver Public Schools offical tells the Post.

Writing letters to his favorite radio program. The BBC looks at Letters Without Signatures, a program it ran for 25 years during the Cold War, and how the Stasi doggedly hunted down East Germans like Borchardt who dared write to it.  The letters are authentic and unfiltered,  an expert on Letters Without Signatures says of the program.  The writers knew there was no censorship here and they spoke from their hearts.  For Borchardt, being able to express his true thoughts was  like coming up for air.  Borchardt wrote his first letter as a 16-year-old in 1968, hiding it underneath his homework in his family's living room. He would write three more letters before the Stasi found him. The East German secret police took saliva samples and fingerprints from the letters they managed to intercept. But it was his handwriting that betrayed Borchardt. In 1970, his class was told to write an essay about their life goals. The essays were turned over to the Stasi and compared to handwriting from the illegal letters. Borchardt was taken from his home on the last day of summer vacation. He spent eight months in isolation in jail before being convicted of  attempted subversive activities  and sentenced to two years in a youth prison.

Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said restoration work isn't likely to begin until 2021—and described his  heartache  that Notre Dame couldn't hold Christmas services this year, for the first time since the French Revolution.

There is also 50% chance of scaffolding falling onto the three vaults, so ... the building is still very fragile.

"(Nov 24, 2016  5:15 PM) The European Space Agency's Mars lander ended up as a smudge on the red planet's surface because of what Gizmodo calls a  crazy miscalculation.  According to a report released by the ESA, the Schiaparelli lander had deployed its parachute and was descending normally when the device that measured how fast it was spinning sent erroneous information to the navigation system that led it to conclude that it was below the surface of the planet. The lander, believing it must have landed, ditched its parachute, fired its braking thrusters, activated its on-ground systems—and then plummeted 2.3 miles to the ground. The ESA says the glitch in the Inertial Measurement Unit was a momentary one, reports Reuters. The glitch also occurred during computer simulations of the response to the erroneous information, which should make the problem easy to identify, the ESA says. Schiaparelli was supposed to be testing technology for a 2020 ESA Mars landing and while its mission was much, much shorter than anticipated, the agency says it still picked up some readings from the Martian atmosphere that will be passed to science teams.  We will have learned much from Schiaparelli that will directly contribute to the second ExoMars mission,  says ESA Director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration David Parker.

The money covers contract and pension payments, including a $3 million retirement bonus that was part of a 2011 contract amendment, reports the Pennsylvania Centre Daily Times. That payment does not include a $1,000-a-month payment for life to Paterno's widow, Sue, nor an additional $900,000 in TV and radio revenue. The university board decided last year to honor the obligations, despite the cloud under which Paterno left.

Mitchell Simon, who was 16 when he tried to kill his parents last fall after they disciplined him for skipping band practice and making inappropriate posts on Facebook, will serve nine years in prison, followed by five years of probation, the New York Daily News reports. His parents told the judge they didn't want their son sent to prison and they don't believe he belongs there.

"(Jul 10, 2017  1:00 PM CDT) Divers have located human bones near the wreckage of a US bomber that crashed in the Adriatic Sea in Croatia in 1944. The discovery was made last week at the site of the crash of the Tulsamerican, the last B-24 Liberator bomber built in Tulsa, Okla., near the end of World War II, according to Croatia's state TV.  The remains of human bones have been found, but we can't say anything without further analysis,  says Zadar University archaeologist Mate Parica. The wreckage itself was found at the bottom of the sea at a depth of some 130 feet near the island of Vis in 2010 after a 17-year search. Three members of the 10-man crew were killed in the crash, reports the AP. The plane was hit after a bombing run over German-occupied Poland. It crashed into the Adriatic Sea on Dec. 17, 1944. The crew apparently tried to get the plane back to its base in Italy, but they eventually decided to ditch it in the Adriatic. An effort to recover and return pieces of the wreckage to Oklahoma for display at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum has been underway for several years. Tomo Medved, who heads Croatia's ministry for war veterans, says the US is still looking for some 200 Americans who perished in Croatia during WWII. Croatia was run by a Nazi puppet regime during the war. Medved pledged the country's cooperation.

"(Feb 3, 2018  7:33 AM) Like a lot of Americans, Kevin Barnaby Jr.'s credit is messed up. The difference in his case is that he's a 4-year-old with two Capital One credit card accounts. Writing for BuzzFeed, Leticia Miranda uses his story as a launchpad from which to dive into the hazy issue of child identity theft. Hazy because, as Miranda writes,  KJ’s experience is not an uncommon one—it's just that child identity theft is poorly documented and poorly policed.  Kids make for good victims, the FTC's identity theft program manager tells her, because their credit is squeaky clean, the theft can go undiscovered for years, and family members have easy access to their SSNs. Sometimes parents use them out of desperation—to keep the lights on, for instance. In KJ's case, his estranged father bought his girlfriend an engagement ring. Miranda asks the big question: Why are banks issuing credit cards based on the SSN of a toddler? Blame loopholes in part, she says, citing a 1974 federal privacy law that makes the feds' SSN database inaccessible to banks and credit bureaus. They're therefore left verifying things using a process of their own making (Miranda points out they could cross-check with the Social Security Administration using a form filled out by the potential credit-card holder, but that would slow the process by up to a week). Making it tougher is that since 2011, kids have been doled out randomized SSNs. In KJ's case, his father allegedly used his son's SSN but his own date of birth to open the cards. He's been convicted of felony identity theft, but KJ's mom is still struggling to clear her son's credit, and is suing three major credit bureaus in an attempt to do so.

"(Apr 13, 2015  11:09 AM CDT) Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine out of 10 adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released today. As recently as 2013, slightly more than eight out of 10 had coverage. Whether the new number from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index turns out to be a high-water mark for President Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all US residents covered, remains to be seen. The law's future is still up in the air and will hinge on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The Gallup-Healthways survey found that the share of adults who lack insurance dropped to 11.9% for the first three months of this year, the lowest level since that survey began its tracking in 2008. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got underway, according to Gallup.  The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,  says the research director for the poll.  The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.  On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since fall 2013, when the first open enrollment was about to begin, according to Gallup.",Almost 90% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance,Almost ____% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance,90,"Multiply( 100 , Divide( Trans( nine ) , 10 ) )",1

Ukraine lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko has published a contract and invoice supposedly from Manafort, a former adviser to pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, detailing a $750,000 payment to Manafort's consulting company in 2009, the BBC reports. The invoice is for 501 pieces of computer equipment, though Leshchenko says it matches a payment to Manafort listed in a secret ledger uncovered by anti-corruption investigators in Ukraine.

"(Jul 27, 2015  6:33 AM CDT) Turkey's nascent fight against ISIS appears to be rapidly intensifying. The country has settled on the broad strokes of a plan with the US that would see the two countries come together to create an ISIS-free zone, with the US supplying warplanes and Turkey contributing troops who wouldn't actually enter the zone but may use long-range artillery from their side of the border. That zone would stretch along 68 miles of the Syria-Turkey border, reports the Washington Post; the Guardian notes the countries share a 500-mile-long border. Syrian sources suggest the zone could stretch 25 miles into Syria. An unnamed senior US official, one of four the New York Times spoke with, says the intention is to  support partners on the ground in northern Syria —elsewhere referred to in the Times article as  relatively moderate Syrian insurgents —who would seize the zone from the ground. There are a few sticky points: Which Syrian rebels will participate? (The Times points out the US had as of earlier this month trained only 60 vetted Syrian fighters.) And how exactly will the respective players' goals sync up? For Turkey and Syria, taking out Bashar al-Assad has long been the chief priority, and both have desired the creation of a no-fly zone. The US says the zone will not be a no-fly one. And while the Post points out that the US has said its warplanes will focus only on ISIS, the plan  would also bring American planes in regular, close proximity to bases, aircraft, and air defenses operated by the Syrian government, and directly benefit opposition rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.","US, Turkey Plan to Wipe ISIS From 68-Mile Zone","US, Turkey Plan to Wipe ISIS From ____-Mile Zone",68,Copy( 68 ),0

Morgan Stanley and the other underwriters have made an estimated $100 million from stabilizing the buffeted stock, in addition to their regular IPO fees, reports the Wall Street Journal. Underwriters typically oversell an IPO by 15% in order to help them stabilize the price—they reportedly bought up some of those extra shares twice on Friday to prevent the shares turning into a loss. But on Monday, the Facebook share price fell below the IPO opening value, allowing the underwriters to buy shares at the new, lower price and pocket the difference, which worked out to about $100 million.

"(Apr 8, 2016  1:32 AM CDT) The first American Idol finale in 2002 was a battle of the sexes, with Kelly Clarkson the victor over Justin Guarini. The last contest settled the score as Trent Harmon defeated La'Porsha Renae for the crown, the AP reports. Harmon tumbled to the stage in surprise as host Ryan Seacrest announced him as the 15th and final winner of American Idol, which ended its remarkable run Thursday. Harmon, 24, who described himself as just a  dude from Mississippi,  waited tables at his family's restaurant in Amory before trying out for the show. American Idol, once a ratings powerhouse that influenced TV and music, suffered steady audience erosion before Fox decided it would end this season. The final show opened with a harmonizing chorus of white-clad winners and contenders, including Scotty McCreery, Taylor Hicks, and Diana DeGarmo. Other familiar faces from years past popped up in solos and group numbers. There was a nod to nostalgia, with clips from auditions presided over by original judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson. Abdul and Jackson showed up to salute Seacrest for his longevity, with Cowell strolling on stage belatedly to steal the spotlight.  I'm feeling quite emotional now,  he said. President Obama was the unexpected opening act. In pre-taped remarks, he congratulated the show on its long run, noted that it motivated millions of young people to vote for contestants, and urged American to demonstrate that same eagerness at the polls.","After 15 Years, American Idol  Crowns Final Winner","After ____ Years, American Idol  Crowns Final Winner",15,Copy( 15 ),0
"(May 3, 2011  11:29 AM CDT) Until Sunday, Osama bin Laden topped the FBI's most-wanted list—and there was a sizable reward offered for information leading to his capture. The State Department offered $25 million, with two air travel associations adding an additional $1 million each. So did anyone collect? Annie Lowrey explains on Slate that there's no way of knowing, but it appears unlikely. The State Department normally likes to boast when it doles out rewards so that more people will be encouraged to turn criminals in. But this time, NPR notes, Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the matter. And we already know many of the key tips came from detainees, none of whom would receive a payout. The rewards program has worked well, proving to be integral to the captures of Saddam Hussein's sons and the 1993 World Trade Center bomber, among others. A spokesperson confirms that bin Laden's reward is no longer available since he's dead, but she would not say whether anyone snagged the reward or a portion of it. Someone might still be in the running for it—perhaps a wary local suspicious of bin Laden's $1 million compound—but from what we know so far, Lowrey writes, it appears  this time the United States got the bad guy the old-fashioned way.",Who Snagged the $27M Reward for bin Laden?,Who Snagged the $____M Reward for bin Laden?,27,"Add( 25 , Multiply( Trans( two ) , 1 ) )",1

The German shepherd disappeared two years ago from the backyard of her home in Southwest Ranches, Fla., when she was just 4 months old, reports WSVN. The Peterson family heard nothing about Cedar until this month, when a deputy across the country in Colorado spotted an abandoned, malnourished dog lying by the side of a road and nearly covered in snow, reports the Miami Herald. The deputy had to pick her up to get her in the car. A vet used Cedar's microchip to track down the Petersons, and Cedar was soon being flown home after some veterinary care.  I immediately cried,  Tamara Peterson tells the Herald.  I couldn't believe it. I was in shock. It's almost two years to the day.  The family has no idea how the dog went missing, but Peterson suspects someone stole her from the yard, because there'd been a spate of such dog thefts in the neighborhood around that time.

But Laura Browder says the kids were always in her line of sight and that she was never more than 30 yards away from them, per KHOU. She says she had just moved to Houston and that she didn't have time to arrange for child care before the interview, the station notes. According to Browder, she brought them to the Memorial City Mall food court, where she had arranged to meet with her interviewer, bought her kids a meal at McDonald's, and sat with them until her interview time, at which point she went to meet her potential employer. Houston police say the two kids were found crying and were brought to a security office, per Click2Houston; a police officer on the scene arrested Browder when she went to retrieve her kids, notes KHOU.

ThinkProgress reports the campaign made four total payments on the same day to  Draper Sterling  for  web advertising.  Draper Sterling was registered to Jon Adkins in New Hampshire in March 2016, according to Vanity Fair. It lists Adkins' apparent home as its headquarters. Paul Holzer, who cofounded medical startup XenoTherapeutics with Adkins, also lists the same address as his home, though a neighbor tells the Huffington Post he doesn't think both men live there. The Trump campaign paid Holzer and Adkins $3,000 each for  field consulting,  as well. ThinkProgress could only find one other public mention of Draper Sterling: an FEC complaint accusing it of being a scam that  helps perpetrate legally questionable activity.  A super PAC called Patriots for America apparently owes Draper Sterling more than $56,000 for  business consulting.  Patriots for America is run by Holzer's brother, Adam McLain, who may be running the super PAC out of a coffee shop owned by Adkins. The coffee shop may or may not be real. And while none of this is outwardly illegal, it's definitely odd. A Republican consultant says Draper Sterling is  a front for Paul Holzer.  Other Republicans say it's being used by ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to  line his own pockets.  On Tuesday, bios for both Holzer and Adkins were removed from the XenoTherapeutics website, which was then briefly taken offline.

Nearly all of the MPs who joined opposition lawmakers in voting for a bill that would prevent a potentially economically damaging, no-deal Brexit that Johnson had promised to deliver if no other agreement was reached by Oct. 31 are former government ministers, reports Business Insider, noting the grandson of Winston Churchill—Johnson's political hero—is among the 21 ejected MPs with more than 330 years of combined parliamentary experience.

(See the hard-to-believe video here.) Fortunately, the other rider maintained control over his bike. The offending racer is 22-year-old Romano Fenati of Italy, whose racing future now appears to be in doubt.  I wish it had been just a bad dream,  said Fenati on Monday, a day after the Moto2 race in San Marino, Italy.  I made a disgraceful gesture, I was not a man,  he added, before apologizing.  The criticisms are correct and I understand the resentment towards me.  Fenati's racing team quickly dumped him, saying that he'd endangered the life of fellow rider Stefano Manzi. The team for whom he was supposed to ride next year followed suit, as did bike maker MV Agusta, reports the BBC.  In all my years of watching sport, I have never seen behavior as dangerous as this,  says Giovanni Castiglioni, head of the bike manufacturer.  A rider who can act like this can never represent the values of our company, and our brand.  Fenati's move came after he and Manzi had contact a couple turns earlier,  but nothing to justify such a reaction,  says Manzi. Other riders chimed in that they don't want to see Fenati allowed back on the track given how dangerous the sport already is.  You can't do this to another motorcycle racer,  says rider Cal Crutchlow of Britain.  We are risking our lives enough.

According to a new study, that series of events is a real possibility, and would threaten more than a quarter of a million Californians.

Keelin O'Neill, who inherited the stamp several years ago from his grandfather, turned it over at the World Stamp Show in New York to the American Philatelic Research Library and collected a $50,000 reward in the process. But the mystery surrounding the Inverted Jenny remains: Who stole it and three other such stamps at a 1955 convention in Virginia?

I have to say, it's quite fascinating, and I'm excited to learn more.  A hundred Inverted Jenny stamps were printed in 1918, until someone noticed the error. The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va. The stamps disappeared from a display case there, and it's been a whodunit ever since. Two were recovered in 1977 and 1982 from Chicago connoisseurs who had bought them.

I know they suffered, and that's the part that, to this day, I still get sad about,  one owner, whose dog Buddy died, tells CTV News. Paulsen now faces six  charges under pretty much every single possible section of animal cruelty that could have been in this particular case,  an SPCA official tells the Global News, including two counts of causing an animal to continue to be in distress—which has never been charged in British Columbia. She could face jail time and stiff penalties; the distress charges carry a $75,000 fine each.",Dog Walker Hit With Charges After 6 Dogs Die in Hot Car,Dog Walker Hit With Charges After ____ Dogs Die in Hot Car,6,Trans( six ),1
"(Sep 3, 2012  3:03 AM CDT) Oscar Pistorius, one of the most acclaimed Paralympic athletes of all time, suffered a stunning defeat yesterday in the T43/44 200 meters, his first-ever loss in that distance at the Paralympics, reports the Telegraph. Brazil’s Alan Oliveira won with a time of 21.45 seconds, earning accusations from Pistorius (who finished in 21.52) that his prosthetic limbs were too long, and thus violated the International Paralympic Committee's regulations.  We’re not racing a fair race here,  Pistorius said right after the race.  The regulations say that you can make yourself unbelievably high.  Pistorius said the evidence is in the video, as Oliveira was shorter than him at racing events last year, but now is taller.  Not taking away from Alan's performance—he's a great athlete—but these guys are a lot taller and you can't compete (with the) stride length,  said Pistorius. However, the IPC said Oliveira's prosthetics were completely legal, according to the AP.  All athletes were measured today prior to competition by a classifier and all were approved for competition,  said the IPC in a statement. Pistorius has since apologized, kind of, via a statement reported by the BBC:  That was Alan's moment and I would like to put on record the respect I have for him.

A tense standoff ended when Navy sharpshooters killed three of Abdiwali Abdiqadir Muse's men and freed captain Richard Phillips. The judge quoted a letter Phillips wrote in which he said modern piracy  is not a Disneyland-esque problem. These are not Johnny Depps. They threaten seamen's lives, repeatedly.  Muse pleaded guilty last year to hijacking, kidnapping, and hostage-taking charges. Before he was sentenced, he apologized to the victims, claiming he was a desperate, small-time player in a Somali piracy syndicate.  I'm very sorry for what I did,  he said through an interpreter.

The victims were almost all Native Americans and Native Alaskans, notes the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, in what one survivor calls a  generational trauma.  The settlement has bankrupted the Society of Jesus' Oregon Province; however, none of the alleged 50 priests, nuns, and lay workers involved have gone to prison.  Instead of teaching these Native American children about the love of God, these pedophile priests were molesting these children,  says a plaintiffs' attorney.

It's tough to say—the usual methods of calculating such things (like census counts) aren't available in the country, reports the Los Angeles Times. But one new study, published yesterday in PLOS Medicine, puts the figure at 461,000. Researchers polled 2,000 households around the country to arrive at the figure, asking people to recall family deaths between 2003 and 2011. This data gave them an estimated 405,000 deaths; they projected that another 55,800 would have been reported by families who fled the country, Al Jazeera America reports. Of those who died, 60% were estimated to have been killed in violence, with the remaining 40% victims of things like damaged infrastructure and inaccessible medical care.  I hope that one of the takeaways from this paper will be that when we invade a country, there are many health consequences that aren’t directly related to violence,  says one of the study authors, who predicts half of that 40% was due to lack of treatment for heart disease. Another figure that might surprise: Only 12% of violent deaths were linked to bombings (gunfire was the leading cause, at 63%). Of course, the study methodology is imperfect, though it has been regarded by many as better than the last attempt, which put the figure at 655,000.

Per the Guardian, health officials in the Canadian city say that up to 550 additional people may have been exposed to the virus at the Brass Rail Tavern, just days after it officially opened back up for business at the end of July. It's not clear what job the infected employee, who worked four shifts in early August, holds at the club. But an initial probe by Toronto Public Health has found the Brass Rail didn't follow proper safety protocols upon reopening, including not adhering to social distancing guidelines between tables and between staff and customers.  We have issued them a notice of noncompliance and we will be going back ... for another inspection,  TPH's Dr. Vinita Dubey said Friday, per CP24.

We suspect that that subject was highly intoxicated,  he said. Twenty-one people were hospitalized after the crash with five victims in guarded condition. Seven others declined to be hospitalized, city Emergency Services Director, Dr. Jeff Elder said. The victims range in age from as young as 3 or 4-years-old to adults in their 30s and 40s, said Elder.

That's according to more than 15 people in Sanders' camp—either professionally or personally—who tell the New York Times that the Vermont senator missed early opportunities to go after Clinton and gain valuable momentum that could have placed him in a much better position than he is now—even in the front-runner seat. And part of the reason for these  early missteps  in 2015 and early 2016, as the Times frames it, may seem surprising, considering the tenacity and perseverance that Sanders is now showing: He didn't initially think he could win and simply wanted to spread his message about the inequities in America. Some feel he could have stepped up more aggressively, and sooner, speaking out more about Clinton's email, Goldman Sachs speaking fees, and involvement in Clinton Foundation finances—topics Sanders initially passed on. And some say if he had stumped more in early voting states instead of attending to his senatorial duties, as well as tried earlier to make inroads with black voters in key Southern states, he may have built the momentum he needed. Not everyone agrees: A George Washington University professor recently told the Washington Times that a tough Sanders offensive would have seemed a  selfish power grab  that  wouldn't [have gone] over well with the many idealists ... in his base.  Although Sanders has now dug his heels in for the long haul, Clinton has what some say is an insurmountable delegate lead—1,712 to Bernie's 1,011, per Bloomberg. Even his wife, Jane, seems to have regrets.  We didn't run all over the nation last year,  she tells the New York Times.

Anderson makes the case that Christmas should be pushed from Dec. 25 to Feb. 7. She's got all kinds of arguments—it's too close to Thanksgiving, for instance, which puts a strain on wallets, travel, and even holiday parties—but her main one revolves around what she sees as the  function of Christmas  (as opposed to the  meaning of Christmas,  which has more religious connotations). And that function?  To bring light and warmth to a dark, cold time of year, thereby making us all a little happier.  But when the holiday ends, we get the  sad last hurrah  of New Year's before beginning the depressing, months-long sludge to spring.  This is totally backward,  she writes.  The Christmas spirit ought to help us get through the darkest, iciest months of the year.  Besides, the date Dec. 25 is  totally arbitrary  in terms of the birthdate of Jesus, which is unknown, so why not give ourselves a break?  Lengthening the Christmas season would give us all more time—more time to spread out our shopping, decorating, baking, and reveling, and also more time to retreat to our homes and escape the hustle and bustle,  writes Anderson.

Though it has just 43 employees, X5 Music Group topped the classical charts last year, its sales on par with Universal, the biggest label there is. Its strategy is a novel one: With no CDs, no contracts with artists, and no new music to offer, it focuses its efforts entirely on the Internet, the Wall Street Journal reports. X5 licenses classical catalogs from other small firms and combines them into greatest-hits-style albums—very big ones. Albums such as  The 99 Most Essential Chopin Masterpieces  are compiled by crunching the pieces’ sales figures. The company designs album covers that look good as thumbnails, and uses search-friendly titles, often including the word  classical.  X5 albums are sold exclusively through online shops like Amazon, and they frequently go for less than $8. The strategy seems to be working: X5 pulled in $10 million last year, and is set to grow by 50% in 2011.

"(Sep 9, 2016  10:14 AM CDT) The five-second rule is off by about five seconds in many cases, and not in the direction you hoped. That's what Rutgers researchers say in a new study debunking the classic kitchen rule, which declares it safe to eat food off the floor if scooped up in a flash.  We decided to look into this because the practice is so widespread,  despite little research to back it up, Donald Schaffner tells Rutgers Today. After dropping watermelon, bread, bread with butter, and gummy candy on stainless steel, tile, wood, and carpeted surfaces crawling with salmonella-like bacteria about 2,500 times—and leaving the food untouched for one, five, 30, or 300 seconds—Schaffner and his team found that food could become contaminated  instantaneously,  they report in Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The longer food sat on the surface, the more bacteria was usually transferred. But in certain cases, contamination occurred immediately, Schaffner says. That's because bacteria  move with the moisture, and the wetter the food, the higher the risk of transfer.  Watermelon, for example, was contaminated most often, and gummy candy least often. To sum up,  the five-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food,  Schaffner says. If you are going to eat food off the floor, carpet is your best bet, since it was least likely to transfer bacteria, say researchers—who point out a 2005 Mythbusters episode found no differences between food left on the floor for two or six seconds, per CTV News.

The change in scheduling was made following an inquiry by nine attorneys general. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Tuesday about 50,000 workers nationwide will benefit. On-call scheduling requires employees to call before a scheduled shift to find out if they have to work that day. Worker advocates say it can leave employees scrambling for child care, unable to hold second jobs, and with uncertain paychecks.  People should not have to keep the day open, arrange for child care, and give up other opportunities without being compensated for their time,  Schneiderman said in a statement.

"(Aug 5, 2010  1:59 PM CDT) Politicians kiss babies all the time, but it's time that they had to kiss their asses, writes Matt Miller for the Washington Post. The best solution to Washington's insistence on selling every 5th-grader's future down the road for the sake of political expediency is to make every politician accountable to the kids. How? Lower the voting age to 10. Kids say the darnedest things, and Miller imagines pols sputtering before pint-sized inquisitors:  What will you tell us if you leave behind a scorched planet? 'Sorry, kids, you had to be there—the interest-group politics were really tough' ? And before you dismiss the idea as ridiculous,  decide for yourself if the grown-ups really occupy the high ground here.  Miller concludes:  I'm not saying  10  is the only answer.

"(Mar 24, 2017  12:12 PM CDT)  It started with a dumb decision,  says Amber VanHecke, a 24-year-old Texas college student who spent five days of her spring break lost near the Grand Canyon. After a day of hiking last week, VanHecke stopped for gas but didn't want to fill up for $2.70 per gallon because she thought it was too expensive, she tells Fox 4. She put only a small amount of gas in her tank and drove on, taking a rough road as instructed by her GPS, reports ABC News. But 20 miles from civilization, her car sputtered to a stop, leaving her without a cell signal.  That was the first moment I felt true panic,  VanHecke says. But  I just wasn't going to give up.  While bad judgment got her stuck, rescuer Jonah Nieves says the former Girl Scout  did everything right  from that point on, per the Arizona Republic. Rationing her 34 bottles of water and snacks, including ramen she cooked on her dashboard, VanHecke made a  help  sign with rocks and stayed with her car, which allowed her to keep her cellphone charged. On March 17, she went in search of a cell signal, which she found 11 miles away. Her call to 911 cut out after 43 seconds, but it was enough time for dispatchers to pick up her general location. Rescuers arrived at her car in a helicopter soon after and found a note she'd left saying she’d gone down the road, which is exactly where they found her crying  tears of joy,  Nieves says. VanHecke was treated for dehydration and exposure and was back exploring the next day.

"(Feb 14, 2019  10:20 AM) The winner of a $1.537 billion lottery jackpot in South Carolina has yet to come forward. That means the state of South Carolina might be a big loser, too. Economic officials estimated the winner would pay $61 million in state income taxes and put that money into the budget. That much money could pay for new voting machines or a police officer in every South Carolina public school. But with the prize unclaimed, the state Board of Economic Advisors is expected Thursday to suggest removing the $61 million windfall from the state spending plan. That's more than 0.6% of South Carolina's $9 billion budget in lawmakers' control.

This isn't a lost chapter from the satirically bizarre Catch-22—it's the truth behind the scenes of a major military corruption investigation, the Washington Post reveals. Vice Adm. Ted Branch ( Twig  is his nickname) has been barred from accessing classified info since November 2013, which is when the Navy got wind from the Justice Department that Branch may be entwined with a case involving bribery of Navy officials by a Malaysian defense contractor. Deciding it was too risky to keep him abreast of the most top-secret info, the Navy stripped him—and one of his deputies, Rear Adm. Bruce F. Loveless—of that access in anticipation of his possible indictment. Meanwhile, the investigation drags on. While Loveless was moved to a lower-level position, Branch was kept in place—a move that has baffled military analysts.  I have never heard of anything as asinine, bizarre, or stupid in all my years,  historian Norman Polmar tells the Post. (Polmar has begged the Navy to rethink this arrangement.) It does seem, at the very least, unwieldy: Not only is Branch barred from meeting with other top US intelligence officials about sensitive projects, he can't hear updates about them, either—and even strolling into a co-worker's office to say hi means that colleague has to  make sure any classified documents are locked up,  per the Post. A Navy spokeswoman simply says that the bribery probe  has not impacted the Navy's ability to manage operations  and that Branch's sensitive tasks are managed by his deputies.

"(Nov 17, 2015  12:14 PM) The good news: Stores in the US lose less revenue to shoplifting than their counterparts in other countries. The bad news: Retail workers in the US are doing more of the stealing themselves … to the tune of $16.6 billion during the past year, according to Checkpoint Systems' Global Retail Theft Barometer released this month. In fact, retail shrinkage in the US resulting from employee theft rose 2% over last year to 45% of total shrinkage, MarketWatch reports. Simply defined, shrinkage is the difference between the revenue businesses should have brought in and the revenue they actually brought in. Meanwhile, shoplifting accounted for 36% of lost revenue in the US. Around the world, 39% of shrinkage is credited to employee theft, while 38% is attributed to shoplifting. MarketWatch notes that the experts behind the Global Retail Theft Barometer aren’t sure just why the rate of employee theft is so much higher in the US. However, they do know that most of the theft happens at the point of sale, occurring  when an associate purposely manipulates a transaction for the benefit of themselves or someone else,  study co-author Ernie Deyle tells MarketWatch. Department stores have the hardest time with employee theft: It accounts for 59% of total shrinkage, compared to 50% of total shrinkage at grocery stores and 44% of total shrinkage at clothing stores.

Rush's Neil Peart, who the CBC notes was  revered by fans and fellow musicians as one of the greatest drummers of all time,  passed away Tuesday at age 67 in Santa Monica, Calif., per a statement issued by a family spokesperson, after being diagnosed with brain cancer more than three years ago. The Canadian band, made up of fellow members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, announced his death Friday afternoon on social media  with broken hearts and the deepest sadness,  asking fans who wanted to help to make a donation to a cancer charity or research group. Peart was also behind much of the lyrics for the band's songs—which NBC News notes were  heavily influenced by science fiction, philosophy, and classic literature —and was known for the elaborate drum and percussion setup that surrounded him as he performed. Peart started drumming as a teen after getting  a pair of sticks, a practice pad, and lessons,  he said in a 2005 interview. He teamed up with Lee and Lifeson in 1974, and Rush soon attracted a worldwide following, selling millions of records. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994, and into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Peart's death brought reaction from big names in music and politics.

I don’t think I can take another day of this,  one banker says getting out of the Goldman Sachs car on Day 4.

Stewart questions Hank Paulson’s claim that there’s no way Lehman Bros. could have been saved, either by a Bear Stearns-type merger, or by an AIG-style bailout. He rejects the argument that there wasn’t enough collateral to go the AIG route, and that there was no viable buyer for Lehman—proposing that poor handling by Paulson soured the Barclay’s and other possible deals. He also reviews the charge that AIG was bailed out to save Goldman, Paulson’s alma mater. Goldman, he calculates, was sufficiently hedged to survive an AIG collapse.

"(Nov 9, 2015  10:43 AM) As expected, Volkswagen, in an effort to appease owners of small diesel-powered cars involved in an emissions cheating scandal, is offering them $1,000 in gift cards and vouchers, the company said. Owners will get a $500 debit card that can be used on anything, plus $500 in the form of a VW credit, notes USA Today. The offer announced Monday is a gesture of goodwill to 482,000 owners of cars whose 2-liter, four-cylinder diesel engines have been implicated in the scandal, the company says. It also includes free roadside assistance for the diesel vehicles for three years. Of note: Owners will not be required to sign anything giving up their right to sue Volkswagen or forcing them into arbitration.  There are no strings attached,  says a spokeswoman. More than 200 class-action lawsuits have been filed in the US against VW alleging that the scandal caused the diesel cars to drop in value. The offer is designed to keep diesel owners happy as VW works on repairs to the cars, which are programmed to turn on pollution controls during government tests and turn them off on the road. The EPA says the cars emit 10 to 40 times the allowable amount of harmful nitrogen oxide.  We are working tirelessly to develop an approved remedy for affected vehicles,  says Michael Horn, VW's US CEO.  In the meantime we are providing this goodwill package as a first step towards regaining our customers' trust.  VW said its Audi luxury brand would launch a similar program Friday.

The China Development Research Foundation recommends a two-child policy for some regions now, with that plan going nationwide by 2015, followed by a drop of all child-limitation policies by 2020. It's a bold move for a group so close to China's leadership, but some say that the timeline isn't aggressive enough.

Exercising 92 minutes per week could substantially extend your life, according to a new study. Researchers in Taiwan studied more than 400,000 subjects between 1996 and 2008, and deduced that those who exercised even a little bit were 14% less likely to die during the next eight years and lived an average three years longer, reports the Washington Post.  If the minimum amount of exercise we suggest is adhered to, mortality from heart disease, diabetes and cancer could be reduced,  wrote the scientists.  This low volume of physical activity could play a central part in the global war against non-communicable diseases, reducing medical costs and health disparities.

It could have been devastatingly expensive, in fact, except for the one thing the elite cyclist says  saved our family : an investment almost 10 years ago in a little company called Uber. Armstrong, 47, tells CNBC that his $100,000 gamble in a venture capital fund back in 2009 has paid off with a number  too good to be true,  though he's keeping quiet on the exact figure. To offer some clue as to how lucrative his asset has become: Uber was valued at $3.7 million when Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital first pumped Armstrong's money into it; now the ride-sharing company is aiming for a $120 billion valuation ahead of a possible IPO. Armstrong tells CNBC's Andrew Sorkin he didn't know at the time that Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital was investing in Uber, thinking instead Sacca bought  a bunch of Twitter shares from employees or former employees.  When pressed by Sorkin on his windfall and whether it was perhaps  10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 million,  Armstrong simply agrees,  It's one of those,  per the BBC. Armstrong, who tells Sorkin the past six years have been  terrible  and  really sucked,  says his behavior, perhaps even more so than the doping itself, was what led to his downfall.

"(Feb 24, 2015  12:02 PM) An ALS patient's life expectancy averages just two to five years after diagnosis, and only about 5% make it past 20 years, the ALS Association notes. But Stephen Hawking, the 73-year-old theoretical physicist and subject of an Academy Award-winning biopic, has beaten the odds and lived with his motor neuron disease for 52 years—and no one's sure why, though some experts suggest factors that may have increased his life span in today's Washington Post. Scientists also don't know for certain what causes ALS (aka Lou Gehrig's disease) in general and are studying genetic and environmental links, the CDC notes. But although the underlying reasons for Hawking's long-term survival are unclear, researchers' thoughts on it aren't.  He is exceptional,  neurology professor Nigel Leigh told the British Medical Journal in 2002.  I am not aware of anyone else who has survived with [ALS] as long.  What also makes Hawking's case unusual is that he was informed of his illness so young: The average age for diagnosis is 55, the Post notes, though Hawking's early onset may have helped him in the long run.  Survival in younger patients is strikingly better and is measured in many years—in some cases, more than 10,  Leigh previously noted to the BMJ. Leo McCluskey, medical director of the Penn ALS Center, told Scientific American in 2012 that a patient could survive ALS for a long time if he didn't succumb to respiratory failure or deterioration of the swallowing muscles. Meanwhile, Hawking told the New York Times in 2011 that he's been lucky to have top-notch medical care and a job that engages his mind, and that perhaps he just has a rare form of motor neuron disease.  Maybe my variety [of ALS] is due to bad absorption of vitamins,  he says, per the Post.

The drama unfolded last week outside a local hospital, with the children in the back seat of a car driven by Nita Coburn, described as either their grandmother or great-grandmother, per WCPO and Fox19. When Coburn exited the car to help her grown daughter into a wheelchair, police say Dalvir Singh jumped into the vehicle and began driving away, with the kids still in the back seat. The 69-year-old Coburn ran after the car and grabbed onto the driver-side door handle. In the meantime, Chance opened his door, but realized the man driving had a hold of sister Skylar's hoodie, say police. He grabbed her, broke the man's grip, and they both tumbled to safety.

"(Mar 28, 2015  3:27 PM CDT) A science publisher in Britain has retracted 43 scientific papers after learning that the peer-review process behind them was fake—possibly pointing to a wider problem in science publishing, the Washington Post reports via Smithsonian. BioMed Central, which has 277 peer-reviewed journals, says it initially received convincing peer review reports on the articles. But then BioMed Central noticed that the reviewers' email addresses didn't seem to fit any institution, and the authors had written articles across various specialized fields. So the publisher investigated, and learned that the authors hadn't written the articles at all; someone else had just used their names.  There is an element of exploitation,  says Jigisha Patel, associate editorial director for research integrity at BioMed Central.  If authors are naive and want to get their manuscripts published, they can be exploited  by services that charge fees for polishing articles and perhaps guaranteeing publication. Patel's boss at BioMed Central source agrees, but says it's unclear whether the authors knew about the fake reviewers and possibly concocted their names, Retraction Watch reports. Most of the fake articles apparently came from China, but Patel says it isn't  a China problem. We get a lot of robust research of China.  Meanwhile, an anonymous tool called PubPeer is allowing scientists to give feedback after articles are published to help weed out mistakes, Vox reports.",43 'Fake' Science Articles May Point to Wider Problem,____ 'Fake' Science Articles May Point to Wider Problem,43,Copy( 43 ),0
"(Oct 16, 2020  11:54 AM CDT) The subject of President Trump's debt surfaced at his town hall Thursday night, and he didn't deny a figure of $400 million raised by NBC's Savannah Guthrie.  It's a tiny percentage of my net worth,  Trump said.  $400 million is a peanut,  he added, per USA Today, especially when  compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world.  As it turns out, Trump has a valid point, writes Dan Alexander at Forbes. According to the magazine's breakdown, Trump's assets total around $3.6 billion. However, his debt is also much higher than $400 million and is closer to $1 billion, by the magazine's tally. The bottom line? Trump's net worth is about $2.5 billion.  He is not broke, despite what many critics claim,  writes Alexander. But  one reason for all the confusion: Trump's loans are not fully transparent. It's still unclear to whom he owes an estimated $162 million against his skyscraper in San Francisco, for example.  Asked Thursday night whether he owed money to foreign entities, Trump said,  Probably,  though he said it wasn't in debt to any  sinister people.

"(Jan 9, 2016  7:58 AM) Star Wars: The Force Awakens opened Saturday in China, where it is far from certain to draw in enough movie-goers to knock off Avatar as the world's all-time biggest grossing movie. The seventh Star Wars movie is the highest ever grossing film in the North American market, where it was released three weeks ago. But internationally, it still has a long way to go to beat James Cameron's science-fiction movie with blue aliens. The international box office of Force Awakens stands at $1.6 billion, compared to the $2.8 billion Avatar made in 2009. Richard Huang, an analyst at Nomura Securities, expects the movie to roughly match the $229 million in Chinese box-office sales that Jurassic World generated last year. Not that many Chinese are familiar with Star Wars. The franchise's three prequel films released from 1999 to 2005 were shown in China, but at a time when there were much fewer screens in the country. And when the first movie came out in 1977,  Mao had just died a year earlier,  NPR's Frank Langfitt says.  The Cultural Revolution had just ended here.  But Disney has been doing a lot of promotion.  Recently, they put about 500 models of Star Wars stormtroopers on the Great Wall,  Langfitt says.

Video of the encounter shows Alessandro slowly and cautiously walking away as the brown bear follows him down a mountain path, with stepfather Loris Calliari urging him to be careful, the BBC reports. The bear rose to its hind legs a few times, but eventually stopped following. Alessandro and his family had been hiking in the mountains in Trentino, northern Italy. Relatives believe the bear, a member of the endangered Marsican brown bear subspecies, had been sleeping when the boy disturbed it while picking pine cones. Calliari tells CNN that Alessandro loves bears and when he first spotted the animal, he asked if he could have a picture taken with the bear behind him. The stepfather says he told Alessandro he would take the picture if he started slowly walking away from the bear.  This is so cool,  the boy says in the video.  I was nervous at first but then saw that the bear was not scared, was not acting, so I calmed down,  but the boy's mother and grandmother were screaming, Calliari says.

Hernandez took all the photos of Steven, even an ultrasound image, that could be used to identify him; Mancia had to contact family in El Salvador to get the sole picture of her son she's treasured all the years since. She reported the kidnapping to the San Bernardino County sheriff's office, but over the years, she tried to wrap her head around the thought that she might never see him again. Then, last week, detectives came to her house:  They told me they found him. They found Steven,  Mancia, 42, tells the San Bernardino Sun. The 22-year-old Steven was found living in Mexico in February after investigators received a tip, the AP reports. Authorities told him they were investigating Hernandez's father, who had recently disappeared himself, and the background information Steven gave them was similar to that of the missing child they were looking for. Eventually, he was positively identified via DNA, and on Thursday, he reunited with his long-lost mom at the San Bernardino DA's office, wiping tears from her face as they hugged.

"(Jan 23, 2019  2:43 PM) The Ancient Greeks took it as a sign that Alexander the Great was a god. A New Zealand researcher says it's actually an important clue into the ruler's demise. Dr. Katherine Hall explains that upon Alexander's death in 323BC, it was recorded that his body went six days without exhibiting signs of decomposition. The leading theories as to what killed him—infection, alcoholism or murder—don't explain that. And Hall, of the University of Otago's Dunedin School of Medicine, thinks she knows what does. The twist? She thinks Alexander wasn't decomposing because he was still alive. Here's her theory: that he contracted the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) from a common infection of the time. GBS would have cause the  progressive, symmetrical, ascending paralysis  he was noted as experiencing prior to death. And that death really came six days later than thought, theorizes Hall in an article published in the Ancient History Bulletin. She says that in that era, death was determined by a cessation of breathing, not pulse. The GBS-caused paralysis and reduced oxygen needs would have made his breathing less obvious, notes a press release. The Otago Daily Times reports it's a theory that Hall says was floated once before, in 1978, but was  never seriously taken up by anyone else.  She spent six months researching the topic. Says Hall,  His death may be the most famous case of pseudothanatos, or false diagnosis of death, ever recorded.

The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and  severely  damages China's sovereignty.

Police are now sure the name was a fake, but they don't know much else about the man in his 60s. And as the Irish Times explains, the mystery endures because of odd details. For starters, he was seen on CCTV cameras leaving the hotel repeatedly (13 times in all) with a purple plastic bag filled with ... something. But when he returned, the bag was always empty. But he was never spotted discarding anything, or using a phone, or mailing letters despite buying 10 stamps, or doing anything that might shed light on his case.  It would be easy to see that he was ex-military or ex-police,  says a local resident.  In relations to the cameras, how he was able to go about his business without people learning anything more about him.  Bergmann, who spoke with an apparent German or Austrian accent, also scouted out a location to swim at a local beach with the help of a taxi driver, though he didn't actually swim at the time. He would return there later. Beachgoers reported seeing him walking along the shore at night, his trousers rolled up, and he was found the next morning, face down in the sand, a seeming drowning victim. Except the autopsy revealed that he didn't drown; he had a heart attack. The autopsy revealed one other telling clue—Bergmann had advanced prostate cancer. He is now buried in an unmarked grave in Sligo. Writer Rosita Boland ticks off some questions:  Why give a false name and address? Did he ever post those 10 letters, and, if so, who were they to?

"(Jan 29, 2014  12:38 PM) When a North Carolina man was bitten by a snake in August, he was successfully treated over 18 hours at Lake Norman Regional Medical Center—for which he was billed $89,227, the Charlotte Observer reports. Some $81,000 of that was for four vials of anti-venom, which Eric Ferguson and his wife Laura decided to look up online. They found it there for $750 to $12,000 per vial. Fortunately for the Fergusons, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina's contractual discount cut the bill to $20,227. Between a deductible and co-pays, Ferguson ultimately paid some $5,400, the Observer reports.  It was just the sticker shock,  says Eric, who thinks it's crazy the hospital raked in twice what Medicare would have paid for the anti-venom: $9,460, which is the average sales price plus 6%, the Observer notes. The private, for-profit Lake Norman Regional Medical Center, owned by major (and somewhat notorious) chain Health Management Associates, says it must offer varying discounts to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers, and  if we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation.  Patients who lack insurance get 62% to 65% discounts, the hospital says.

"(Dec 18, 2015  6:50 PM) An alarming new study finds that when pre-adolescent kids get concussions, they still suffer from  deficits in brain function and cognitive performance  two years later, the lead researcher says in a press release. Most pediatric concussions are a result of sports injuries, according to the study, which was published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology. While some previous researchers have claimed only a small portion of kids suffer developmental problems after a concussion, this study highlights the potential for lifelong ill effects from early head injuries, says a researcher on the new study. Researchers looked at 30 kids aged 8 to 10, all of whom were involved in athletics. Half of them had suffered a sports-related concussion two years prior; the other half had never had a concussion. Researchers tested the kids' memory skills and ability to pay attention and control their impulses when instructed to; they also analyzed electrical signals in the brain during some of the cognitive tests to determine how the brain performed the tasks. Children who'd had concussions did worse on the tests, and the electrical signals also showed impaired performance when compared to the other kids' brains.  The findings demonstrate that children with a history of concussion exhibit behavioral deficits in attention, working memory, and impulse control,  per the study. And the differences were the worst in children who suffered concussions at the earliest ages.  Our study suggests the need to find ways to improve cognitive and brain health following a head injury,  the lead researcher says.

Elizabeth Addy  was yelling for help and waving her hands at me,  Ruediger notes, so he pulled the car over and helped her down. The story in the police report: Per Richard Addy, he and his wife had been drinking together at a bar in the resort where they were staying and gotten into a tiff, so he decided to  leave the scene.  He claims he didn't realize initially she had leaped on top of his car and that the only reason he didn't stop when he finally did hear her  banging on the roof  was because he didn't have a cellphone with which to call the cops. Instead, he cruised by a courthouse, hoping to find  police presence,  and when he didn't, he just continued on his way—rooftop passenger and all. Richard Addy reeked of booze, per the officer, but charges against him include only reckless driving and the probably-not-often-used  permitting a passenger to ride on the exterior of the vehicle.

The BBC reports that the Cuvier's beaked whale turned up on the shoreline east of Davao City on Saturday, and when workers from the D'Bone Collector Museum opened up the whale's belly, they found  the most plastic we have ever seen in a whale,  the educational NGO said in a Facebook post. Although they're still working on documenting all the contents of the whale's belly, workers say they've so far extracted 88 pounds of plastic, including  16 rice sacks, four banana plantation-style bags, and multiple shopping bags.  CNN Philippines reports the cause of death for the whale—which the New York Times notes was 15 feet long and 1,100 pounds—as dehydration and starvation due to plastic ingestion. Starvation comes about because eating plastic makes the whales feel full, which leads them to eat less and not get the nutrients they need. Marine biologist Darrell Blatchley explains that the reason dehydration set in as well is because whales hydrate from the water in their food sources, not from drinking it.  I was not prepared for the amount of plastic,  he tells CNN, adding to the Times,  The plastic in some areas was so compact it was almost becoming calcified, almost like a solid brick.

On Thursday, Melbourne's Federal Court of Australia handed down the fine the Aussie blogger will pay as a consequence: around $320,000, the BBC reports. The 25-year-old had made a name for herself in her home country when she claimed she'd beaten her cancer through a regimen of healthy living and eating, which she monetized via an app and cookbook she created, both called The Whole Pantry. Per the AP, the fine was handed down due to Gibson's claims that proceeds from the app and cookbook would go to different charities. But the charities never got those funds, and that's when questions started to pop up about Gibson herself. It was in mid-2015 when Gibson finally admitted she'd never had brain cancer, or other cancers she'd also initially said she had (she later called those misdiagnoses).

The Kendall + Kylie brand released a statement in response to a copyright infringement lawsuit filed Friday by a commercial photographer who shot the images on the shirts. The lawsuit by commercial photographer Michael Miller accused the Jenner sisters of using two images of Shakur without his permission. The label's statement says the shirts with Shakur's image were obtained from a company that had a valid license to sell them. The Kendall + Kylie brand superimposed images of the Jenner sisters or other designs over photos of musicians, including Shakur, Notorious BIG, and Ozzy Osbourne. The statement calls Miller's lawsuit baseless.  The allegations made are completely false,  it notes.  There has been no infringement or violation of anyone's rights.

The next day, the 14-year-old freshman at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas—a member of his middle school robotics club who makes radios and repairs his own go-kart—showed his creation to his engineering teacher, hoping to impress him, per the Dallas Morning News.  He was like, 'That's really nice,'  but said not to show the clock to other teachers, Ahmed says. When it beeped during another lesson, however, Ahmed revealed his invention to a teacher, who told him it looked like a bomb. Soon, Ahmed tells NBC Dallas police officers arrived, questioned him, then cuffed him and led him to police headquarters for fingerprints, mugshots, and an interrogation. Officers, who took the clock and Ahmed's tablet, tell USA Today Ahmed was being  passive aggressive  during questioning, and though he maintained the device was a clock, couldn't provide a  reasonable answer  for why he had it.  I brought something to school that wasn't a threat to anyone.

Chiropractor David Silverstein and Lyudmila Shimonova stand accused of filing false claims, reports the AP, and the government says their ruse went something like this: Shimonova received Section 8 housing assistance (along with Social Security cash and other benefits via the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program) by claiming to live alone with her two kids, with household assets under $5,000. Silverstein, her  landlord,  raked in the monthly benefits of $1,272. They both apparently lived in the three-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot home on Lake Washington, which came complete with black Jaguar in the driveway. Shimonova had claimed she was single and lived there alone, and Silverstein listed his office as his residence to conceal his actual location. As for Shimonova telling the government she was unwed, it seems the duo overlooked this blurb on Silverstein's business website:  On a personal note, I am happily married with two children, whose careers are in medicine and Middle Eastern studies.

That's when she saw third-grader Kolston Moradi and realized it wasn't juice.  There were pools of blood at his feet and his whole shirt was covered in blood,  Kapopoulos tells the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Moments earlier, Kolston had been stabbed in the arm by his own freshly sharpened pencil, which was poking out of his backpack. The pencil went about 6 inches deep near Kolston's armpit and jabbed an artery. Kolston tells WPTV he  didn't really feel anything.   He wasn’t screaming or crying or saying anything,  Kapopoulos tells the Sun Sentinel. Kapopoulos says she wrapped her sleeve around Kolston's arm in a makeshift tourniquet and yelled for help.

That brings the total dead—through six strikes in less than two weeks—to 29 as reports of renewed terrorist activity in the area spread.  Mareb was a previous stronghold for al-Qaeda, and a number of members of the group still live in the province,  a security official told CNN, but not everyone is thrilled with the American decision to launch strikes.

In the deadliest bombing, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people with explosives hidden in a produce truck, and officials suspect he bribed several checkpoint guards. A recent surge in violence in Iraq has been blamed on the country's political crisis, and on the diversion of weapons intended to help rebels in Syria.

"(Feb 1, 2016  3:10 PM) Now that California has lifted its moratorium on the death penalty, convicted murderer Kevin Cooper, 57, is once again preparing to be executed for high-profile slayings he says he didn't commit.  I am innocent,  Cooper tells NBC News.  And it's not my execution, it's my murder.  Cooper has been on death row since 1985, when he was convicted of the brutal 1983 slayings of Doug and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year-old daughter, and another child who was spending the night in their Chino Hills, Calif., home. The Ryens' 8-year-old son, left for dead with a slit throat, survived. He initially told police that three white or Latino men committed the murders but has since come to believe that Cooper was the lone killer. Prosecutors say Cooper, who had escaped from a nearby prison the previous night, had been hiding out in a house near the Ryen home. Wielding a hatchet, ice pick, and one or more knives, they say he slaughtered the victims and drove away in their station wagon. Cooper has maintained his innocence throughout, and there are plenty of people who believe him, saying police withheld information, ignored other suspects, and tampered with evidence, particularly blood samples. In 2004, Cooper was three hours away from being put to death when a federal appeals court stopped the execution, deciding some of the evidence was flawed.  You watch the clock as your life goes off,  he says,  minute by minute.  Nonetheless, many others say Cooper is guilty, even former defense team members, writes San Francisco Chronicle columnist Debra Saunders. To think otherwise is  utterly unreasonable,  the California Supreme Court ruled in 1991. Cooper's conviction was upheld in 2009, keeping him on death row.

"(Feb 4, 2015  8:50 AM) More details from  one of the darkest chapters of Australia's maritime history  are coming to light, nearly 400 years after they occurred. On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered  by accident.  Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more:  This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia—albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here—so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.

Beijing says it is slapping new tariffs on 128 kinds of American products, including pork, wine, and numerous kinds of fruit,  in order to safeguard China's interests and balance the losses caused by the United States' additional tariffs,  reports the Financial Times. The move adds a 25% tariff on top of existing duties to American scrap aluminum and frozen pork, the BBC reports. It also adds a 15% tariff to American wine, nuts, ginseng, apples, oranges, and scores of other food products, affecting goods worth a total of around $3 billion. China's Ministry of Commerce said it has suspended its World Trade Organization obligations after US moves that  seriously infringed on China's rights and interests,  the Telegraph reports. Trump, who accuses Beijing of abusive trade practices and theft of intellectual property, has threatened more tariffs, and analysts fear the trade war could escalate.  There are plenty more American companies to be hit, and other nations, especially those in Europe and Asia, could soon find themselves dragged into this conflict,  notes Stephen McDonell at the BBC.

"(Dec 1, 2020  8:11 AM) A septuagenarian Swedish mother is denying she held her son hostage for nearly three decades after he was reportedly discovered, in bad shape, by a relative. Per local media reports cited by AFP, the 41-year-old man was discovered Sunday after his mother ended up in the hospital and an unidentified family member went to her apartment in the Stockholm suburb of Haninge. Reports in the Expressen and Aftonbladet newspapers say the mother is suspected of yanking him out of school when he was 12 or so and keeping him locked up ever since, though police spokesman Ola Osterling would only say he'd been held  for a very long time.  Osterling confirmed that the man has been hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, with reports noting he was found with sore-ridden legs and next to no teeth, was barely mobile, and had only a limited ability to speak.  The mother is suspected of illegal deprivation of liberty and causing bodily harm,  Osterling notes. The relative who went into the apartment says the place  smelled rotten,  was filled with piles of junk and  urine, dirt, and dust.  The  brokenhearted  family member notes she suspected for a while that the mother was exerting some sort of control over the man. Most neighbors say they hadn't seen him in years, though one tells Aftonbladet she spotted him at the grocery store a few months back.  I know who you are, you're my neighbor,  he said to her, per NDTV. Another local says she would occasionally bump into the mother and make small talk, and the mother would say her son was fine. That neighbor says it seemed weird to her that the apartment's window was always shut, and that the same candlestick had been in it for 30 years.

"(Jun 12, 2014  6:47 AM CDT) Missiles from US drones slammed into militant hideouts overnight in northwestern Pakistan, killing 13 suspected insurgents and marking the resumption of the CIA-led program after a nearly six-month break, officials said today. The two separate drone strikes sparked swift condemnation by the Pakistani government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the strikes are a violation of Pakistani sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the first strike, late yesterday, a suspected American drone fired two missiles at a militant hideout in the North Waziristan tribal area near the Afghan border, killing three militants. Then, early today a suspected US missile strike targeted another militant compound in North Waziristan, killing at least 10 people. There was no immediate information on the identities of those killed in the strikes but the two intelligence officials who gave information about the strike said the area is dominated by the Haqqani network, and most of those killed are believed to have belonged to the organization. Due to stricter rules on the use of drones, diplomatic sensitivities, and the changing nature of the al-Qaeda threat, the number of American drone strikes had dwindled. These were the first since Christmas, and even before that, the number of strikes every year had been steadily dropping. (Meanwhile, the US has rejected Iraq's plea for airstrikes.)","After 6-Month Hiatus, Drone Strikes Again Hit Pakistan","After ____-Month Hiatus, Drone Strikes Again Hit Pakistan",6,Copy( 6 ),0

Adam Disney, 28, was out with a female friend in September when—well, we'll just let the defense attorney take it from here:  They had been drinking and the couple were passionate in their interest to have sexual relations. On this occasion they were seeking to avail themselves rather quickly.  So they did the most logical thing: Let themselves into Disney's old apartment using a key he still had. No one was living there at the time, but around 10:45am the next morning, neighbors heard Disney and his companion going at it, and called police ... who arrived to find Disney, as well as a damaged bed, curtain rail, and window sill. As the defense attorney puts it, the couple was  carried away with the intensity of physical relations,  and their  sexual antics  broke the bed and pulled down the curtains.

"(Apr 27, 2016  12:01 AM CDT) The families of 96 Liverpool soccer fans who were crushed to death at a crowded stadium in 1989 declared they had finally won justice Tuesday after a jury found that police and emergency services were to blame for Britain's worst sports disaster. The jury exonerated the behavior of the crowd, saying it did not contribute to the tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, and that the victims were  unlawfully killed.  Relatives who had waged a tireless campaign to protect the reputation of their loved ones leapt to their feet outside a specially built courtroom, cheering and weeping, when the verdicts were announced. They chanted,  Justice for the 96!  and sang the Liverpool soccer club's anthem,  You'll Never Walk Alone.  The Hillsborough tragedy unfolded on April 15, 1989, when more than 2,000 Liverpool fans were allowed to flood into a standing-room section. After the tragedy, a false narrative that blamed drunken, ticketless, and rowdy Liverpool fans was created by police and spread by a local lawmaker. David Duckenfield, the police chief superintendent in charge of policing the game, testified at the inquests that he told a  terrible lie  by saying fans had rushed through gates into the stadium, rather than admitting to authorizing the gates to be opened.  The disgrace is that we've been faced by police slander upon slander, insult upon insult,  says Hillsborough campaigner Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters in the crush.  Now, truth has won out.

"(May 4, 2017  5:45 AM CDT) Apple, long criticized for making its products overseas, is planning to give American manufacturing a major boost, CEO Tim Cook says. Cook told Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's Mad Money, Wednesday that the company is starting a $1 billion fund to help create advanced manufacturing jobs in the US. He said the company wants to be the  ripple in the pond.   Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs ... those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them,  Cook explained. Apple says its products support around 2 million American jobs, though it only directly employs about 80,000 people in the US. Cook told CNBC that he believes a company should have values—and one of those values should be  giving back  to the community.  We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy,  he said.  We give back in job creation.  He said the fund's first investment will be made this month. The Wall Street Journal notes that Apple—which is sitting on a $257 billion mountain of cash and cash equivalents—was slammed by President Trump during his campaign for shifting production overseas.

"(Jul 19, 2015  2:45 PM CDT) Abraham Lincoln helped free a black male slave long before the Civil War, and researchers say they've found the man's grave—in a former psychiatric hospital's cemetery, the AP reports. A budding lawyer, Lincoln won a case before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841 that released Nance Legins-Costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-Costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, William Henry Costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central Illinois hometown of Pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by Lincoln? An amateur historian named Carl Adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about Legins-Costley last year, Nance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincoln—A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley. The editor of a history journal says Nance tells  the only story of Lincoln that is really new,  according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from Illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in Galveston, Texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; Costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, Costley moved to Minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in Rochester. There, Adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as Costley's. It also recently received a  Costley  headstone.  I think it is so likely that it's nearly a sure thing,  says a Lincoln expert.

Oskar Groening testified during his trial at the state court in Lueneburg, in northern Germany, that he guarded prisoners' baggage after they arrived at Auschwitz and collected money stolen from them. Prosecutors said that amounted to helping the death camp function. The charges against Groening related to a period between May and July 1944 when hundreds of thousands of Jews from Hungary were brought to the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex in Nazi-occupied Poland. Most were immediately gassed to death. Unusually for trials of former Nazi camp guards, Groening, who was dubbed the  accountant of Auschwitz  by German media, was open about his past throughout the proceedings. He said when his trial opened in April that he bears a share of the moral guilt for atrocities at the camp but that it was up to judges to determine whether he is guilty under criminal law. His defense team had called for him to be acquitted, arguing that as far as the law is concerned he did not facilitate mass murder.

The Athens Banner-Herald reported today that Union Grove Baptist Church of Elberton said Genora H. Biggs was displaying conduct detrimental to the congregation. The woman has been a church member for 92 years but disagreed with its pastor, Timothy Mattox, about worship practices that include laying hands on members. Biggs, a retired teacher, says such activities aren't Baptist but were introduced at the church by Mattox, one of her former students.  He is a holy sanctified minister or so he says.

He hasn't picked a university yet, but he knows where he'd like it to be.  I really want to go to California; the weather is nice there,  Laurent said. He plans to someday develop artificial organs, or be a heart surgeon, or become an astronaut. Or do all those things.

Bush says he wants to stay under the radar these days—hence his refusal of Barack Obama's invitation to attend a Ground Zero ceremony following Osama bin Laden’s death. But that’s not keeping him from accepting six-figure speaking engagements, and plenty of them, the Daily Beast reports. Bush has given some 140 talks since leaving office, says a rep for Bush, and he reportedly earns between $100,000 and $150,000 for each. All told, he’s raked in some $15 million from the speeches, from which the press is largely banned. During the week after the Ground Zero event, Bush gave three speeches: one to hedge-fund bosses; one to Swiss bank UBS, at which Bush was joined by Bill Clinton, who’s also raked in tens of millions for post-presidency appearances; and one at a golf event. The talks have taken him to Canada, Asia, and New York; his rep notes that he has a few dozen events lined up for this year.

Some 45 Superfund sites in New York and New Jersey were within a half-mile of areas vulnerable to storm surge, the Wall Street Journal reports. And the EPA says that at least a few such sites—seen as America's most dangerous toxic waste hotspots— were impacted by the storm.  Among them: a lead-tainted site near Sayreville, NJ, and two locations in Brooklyn. New York state officials think that the floodwaters washed over the sites without rustling up low-lying chemicals. The EPA, for its part, says tests thus far reveal just  low levels  of cancer-linked pollutants around Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. As for New Jersey,  Superfund sites were not inundated by tidal surges,  says an official. But other experts say more thorough testing is needed.  There really has to be a careful evaluation of whether there has been any disturbing of the waste,  says a former New Jersey EPA official.

"(Dec 6, 2011  12:46 AM) Two men who have accused a dead Boston Red Sox clubhouse manager of sexually abusing them when they were batboys are filing a $10 million lawsuit against the team.  These were inner city kids happy to have jobs with the Red Sox,  said their lawyer yesterday.  Then they were sexually molested by Donald Fitzpatrick, a serial pedophile. It's similar to the Penn State case.  Fitzpatrick died in 2005 at the age of 76. The team settled a $3.15 million lawsuit with seven Florida men in 2003 who accused Fitzpatrick of molesting them during spring training in the 1970s, and Fitzpatrick pleaded guilty in 2002 to four counts of attempted sexual battery. The team also paid $100,000 to a former clubhouse attendant who charged that he was assaulted during a team trip. This is the first time accusations have involved incidents at Fenway Park, according to the Boston Globe. One of the men in the current lawsuit, Charles Crawford, said Fitzpatrick assaulted him twice in 1991—in a restroom and an equipment room at Fenway—when he was a 16-year-old batboy.  I’ve held one of Boston’s darkest secrets all these years, knowing people would have been blown out of their seats if they knew what the Red Sox let happen to me,’’ he said. A Red Sox attorney said officials were unaware of the incidents in the lawsuit, but that the team has  always viewed the actions of Mr. Fitzpatrick to be abhorrent.  When the Sox became aware of other allegations against Fitzpatrick in 1991, the manager was  promptly relieved of his duties,  the attorney added.

We cannot beat Ebola without more funding,  he said during a visit yesterday to the National Institutes of Health, the New York Times reports.  It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world,  he added, as per the AP. And while the New York Times reports that monitoring has ended for those exposed to the NYC doctor who had Ebola, and the Boston Globe notes that Massachusetts General Hospital says everything there is under control with a patient suspected of having the virus, the international response to the crisis overseas is still taking heat. A Doctors Without Borders report issued yesterday notes that global help has been  patchy and slow ; although progress has been made in building Ebola management centers in West Africa, staffing is often subpar.  People are still dying horrible deaths in an outbreak that has already killed thousands,  the president of Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.  We can't let our guard down and allow this to become a 'double failure': a response that is slow to begin with, and then is ill-adapted in the end.

They left hours after Republicans shut the House down for the Fourth of July holiday (a move that resulted in chants of  shame ).

Life is filled with contrasts for the 17-year-old from San Gabriel, Calif., who has dashed by major milestones as his age seems to lag behind. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a bachelor's in math from the University of California, Los Angeles. This year he started online classes to get a master's in cybersecurity through Brandeis University. He decided to postpone that pursuit for a couple of terms, though, while he helps NASA develop surveillance technology for airplanes and drones. He also just published his second book, drawing on his experience being bullied, and plans to have his pilot's license by year's end.  My case isn't that special.

The New York surgeon's daughter confirmed his Oct. 4 death at a care facility in Warren, NJ, to the New York Times, which notes the roster of famous people who found themselves under Thorbjarnarson's care, including Warhol, Johnny Carson, and Reza Pahlavi, the late Shah of Iran.

It was Warhol's case at the hospital that thrust Thorbjarnarson into the headlines: Warhol died at the age of 58 a day after what was supposed to be a  routine  surgery on his gallbladder in February 1987, and Warhol's estate brought a wrongful death lawsuit against the hospital and medical staff. The complaint alleged Warhol hadn't received adequate post-op care and had been flooded with IV fluids, leading to  internal drowning,  per his lawyers. However, an autopsy found Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia, and the hospital said Warhol's poor health pre-surgery led to his death. The hospital settled with Warhol's estate.

The group estimated there were 22 veteran suicides per day in 2010, but had never taken an official count, reports USA Today. The decline from the 2010 estimate is nothing to celebrate, according to David Shulkin, VA's undersecretary for health, who says the most recent number is  still far too high.  Veterans accounted for 18% of all suicides in the US in 2014, though they made up just 8.5% of the population. About 65% of the veterans were 50 or older and 70% were not regular recipients of VA services, reports the Military Times. Among male veterans aged 18 to 29, the suicide rate was 86 per 100,000 people; the US suicide rate as a whole is 13 per 100,000. The rate for female veterans aged 18 to 29 was 33 per 100,000. Suicide rates among American females jumped 40% from 2001 to 2014 but 85% among female veterans.  It is difficult to understand why that is happening. It is one of the things that I think will become a central research question for us,  says Shulkin, who hopes to discover whether sexual trauma or combat service increases a woman's suicide risk. The VA says it is  aggressively  tackling the suicide issue, including by offering same-day service to veterans with urgent mental health needs, per ABC News.

"(Oct 28, 2014  4:41 PM CDT) If trekking into the wilds of northern Canada, drilling samples out of the ice core, and analyzing caribou poop to find a pair of really old viruses sounds like your idea of a hot Friday night, well, we present you Eric Delwart. As NPR reports, the viral researcher did just that with 700-year-old caribou scat after it occurred to him that the ice  is nature's freezer, which should also contain organic remains.  And given that animals of all kinds are  constantly shoving viruses down our throat ... if you look at poo samples from humans and from animals you will find a lot of viruses,  he reasoned. Delwart's theory panned out, and he found two previously undiscovered viruses. His results, published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA in one of the viruses was in such great shape that it could be used to infect a plant. And while Delwart doesn't think either is dangerous, NPR offers up this cautionary coda:  As the North warms and ice melts, more caribou poo infected with ancient viruses will be finding its way into the modern ecosystem.

"(Sep 5, 2019  6:38 AM CDT) Oregon health officials are investigating the death of an individual who developed a severe respiratory illness after vaping; if a link is confirmed, it would be the country's second vaping-related death. A lead investigator on the new case, Dr. Ann Thomas, tells the New York Times that the person was  otherwise healthy and quickly became very ill  after vaping THC from a device that was apparently legally bought at a recreational marijuana dispensary. The patient was hospitalized with a lung infection and put on a ventilator but ultimately died in July, a month before Illinois revealed an adult vaper had died of a severe respiratory illness.  We don't yet know the exact cause of these illnesses—whether they're caused by contaminants, ingredients in the liquid or something else, such as the device itself,  Thomas says, per NBC News. The Times reports dozens of chemicals may be inhaled through vaping; health officials warn there's no information on the long-term effects. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which oversees marijuana sales, says it's prepared to trace the vaping device involved in the July death and issue a recall if necessary. The CDC has again updated the total number of people who could have severe lung disease caused by vaping: It now stands at 215 in 25 states, per CBS News. However, NBC News reports a survey of state health departments revealed 330 confirmed or suspected cases of vaping-related lung diseases.

Nigerian troops ran the rescue operation in Sambisa Forest, during which one of the hostages and one soldier were killed, CNN reports. Troops are now working to destroy militant camps—they've hit nine so far—in the forest.  Many of those kidnapped have undergone psychological trauma and indoctrination,  says an army spokesman—and indeed, some of the 293 women and girls rescued earlier in the week had been so indoctrinated by Boko Haram, they actually opened fire on their rescuers, the AP reports. A counselor who has treated other Boko Haram hostages says this is not uncommon, and that hostages can also become attached to militants they are forced to marry. Experts say many of the rescued women and girls will need intensive psychological treatment. The Nigerian military earlier said the 293 women and girls rescued were not the  Chibok girls  taken more than a year ago, launching the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, but now the army spokesman says it's too early to tell who they are.

"(Oct 1, 2020  1:10 PM CDT) Got an extra $400 lying around? Love swans? If you're near Lakeland, Fla., or can get there, you're in luck. CNN reports that, starting sometime in the next few weeks, the city will be selling off about half of the 80 resident swans that live on Lake Morton. The move will hopefully lead to a significant decrease in the annual $10,000 cost of feeding and caring for the birds.  We are really overpopulated,  Bob Donahay, the city's parks and rec chief, tells the Lakeland Ledger. Before the swan sale, the city will conduct its annual wellness  roundup,  where the birds will be gathered together and given a thorough veterinarian exam. Although no background checks will be required to scoop up a swan, Donahay says city officials will have  a great conversation  with potential buyers about their plans for the bird. Donahay adds that the swans will likely be placed with people who have bodies of water in or near their residences, or with wedding venues, funeral businesses, and nursing homes. The Ledger notes that by slashing the swan population, the city will also hopefully help cut down on the number of swans hit by cars, as well as keep them from having to fight over territory. Steve Platt, a grounds maintenance supervisor for the city, says there's a  mile-long  list of folks who've expressed interest in buying one; he notes the city will contact those interested parties, as well as post ads for the swan sale. One thing city officials will try not to do, he adds: separate mated pairs, which they keep tabs on via the birds' microchips.

"(Nov 20, 2020  7:34 AM) Few industries have been as thoroughly devastated by the pandemic as the cruise industry, which suspended voyages from the US in March and won't resume them until next year. Bari Golin-Blaugrund, an exec at the Cruise Lines International Association industry group, tells USA Today that COVID-19 has had  a devastating impact on the economy and on those who depend on cruise activity for their livelihoods.  She says the industry contributed around $55 billion to the US economy last year, but the suspension of US sailings has caused the loss of an estimated $32 billion in economic activity and around 254,000 American jobs. The jobs lost are in many sectors,  from transportation and aviation, to food and beverage services, lodging, manufacturing, agriculture, travel agencies,  as well as suppliers and service providers across the US, Golin-Blaugrund says.

Amanda Staples says Bush  grabbed my butt and joked and said, 'Oh I'm not THAT president  during a photo-op. Vanity Fair states this was  presumably  a reference to Bill Clinton.

Staples says she  can only imagine how many women  have been victimized in the same way and that she would never tell her hypothetical daughter  to shrug it off because he was the president.  Bush had previously been accused of groping two actresses and an author while making a  David Cop-a-feel  joke.

In the US, about 20% of adults say they were harmed at least once in the past year due to someone else's drinking, CNN reports. The study asked about 10 different types of harm: harassment; feeling threatened or afraid; ruined belongings; vandalized property; being pushed, hit or assaulted; being physically harmed; traffic accidents; being a passenger in a vehicle with a drunk driver; family or marital problems; and financial trouble. And the true number of those experiencing secondhand harm due to alcohol is likely higher, a study author says: The study  is only limited to a snapshot in time of about a year. So probably more people have actually been harmed by someone else's drinking at other times in their life.  Per a press release, study authors believe policymakers should address this issue in the same way they address the harms of secondhand smoke. Harassment was the most prevalent type of harm reported. Beyond that, for women—21% of whom reported experiencing at least one type of harm in the prior year—family or marital problems and financial problems came in next; women were more likely than men to report harm due to the behavior of a spouse, partner, or family member. Men, conversely, were more likely than women to report harm due to a stranger's behavior. After harassment,  for men, the driving-related harms were the most common, followed by property damage and vandalism,  the study author says. The study found that those under age 25 were more likely than older adults to have experienced harm due to someone else's drinking, and a professor not involved with the study found that interesting:  People who are 18 to 25, they are showing the highest rates of alcoholism,  she tells CNN.

"(Nov 6, 2011  5:46 AM) A magnitude 5.6 earthquake last night was the strongest in a series that shook Oklahoma—a state more accustomed to tornadoes—cracking buildings, buckling a highway, and rattling nerves. The 5.6 quake was the state's strongest ever and shook a college football stadium 50 miles away, while another of lesser intensity struck before dawn today.  That shook up the place, had a lot of people nervous,  Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon said of the quake, the strongest of a series that began hours earlier.  It was pretty strong.  The 5.6 earthquake was centered near Sparks, 44 miles northeast of Oklahoma City, and could be felt as far away as Tennessee and Wisconsin, according to reports received by the US Geological Survey. A magnitude 4.7 quake early yesterday was felt from Texas to Missouri. The USGS said the latest quake hit at 3:39am today, measuring 4.0 in magnitude and centered 36 miles east of Oklahoma City. Oklahoma typically has about 50 earthquakes a year, but a swarm of quakes east of Oklahoma City contributed to a sharp increase. Researchers said 1,047 quakes occurred last year, prompting them to install seismographs in the area.

"(Feb 19, 2020  8:03 AM) After two deadly crashes that killed 346 people, the beleaguered Boeing 737 Max has a new problem, and per a company spokesman, it's an  absolutely unacceptable  one. A routine maintenance check on multiple new planes waiting to be delivered turned up in their fuel tanks  foreign object debris,  which the BBC notes is  any substance, debris, or article that isn't part of a plane [and that] would potentially cause damage.  Per the Guardian, such debris usually consists of metal shavings, rags, tools, or other items left behind in the plane by workers during production. Leeham News, which first reported the development, notes it may take up to three days to inspect each plane, as all fuel has to be drained and the vapors eliminated before inspectors can even enter the fuel tanks to check them out.  FOD is absolutely unacceptable,  Mark Jenks, head of Boeing's 737 program, said in a memo to employees.  With your help and focus, we will eliminate FOD from our production system.  The entire fleet of 400-plus undelivered 737 Max planes is now being inspected, though a Boeing rep tells the BBC it doesn't look like this will further delay getting the 737 Max back in the air; Boeing expects the FAA to recertify the plane to fly again by summer. The FAA has indeed been informed of this latest development and, via a statement, says that it's  following a thorough, deliberate process to verify that all proposed modifications to the Boeing 737 Max meet the highest certification standards,  per Sky News. The fuel tank problem isn't tied to the sensor issues that are believed to have played a role in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.

"(Mar 2, 2017  2:33 AM) How much would you pay for a piece of mold? If your answer is  nothing,  it may surprise you to know that someone else's answer was $14,617. A patch of green bacteria encased in a round glass dish sold for that sum to an unnamed buyer at a London auction on Wednesday, the AP reports. The furry sample's case is signed on the back by Alexander Fleming, the scientist who sourced the world's first life-saving antibiotic from Penicillium chrysogenum in 1928. His inscription describes this sample as  the mould that first made penicillin —which may not quite be so, the AP notes, since the Scottish-born doctor produced many such medallions. The payday for Fleming's niece, who sold the sample, was substantially higher than the predicted sale price of $5,000. But it may have been a relative bargain for the buyer. Pfizer paid many times that—$51,000 in today's dollars—in 1996 for a similar blob, Quartz reports. Once thought to be rare, it turns out many samples exist, made by Fleming and gifted to notables such as Winston Churchill, Pope Pius XII, and Marlene Dietrich  almost as a kind of holy relic,  a rep for Bonham's auction house tells the AP. Not everyone was happy to receive one. Queen Elizabeth's husband reportedly griped about getting  another one of these bloody things,  notes Quartz. More bits of trivia: Smithsonian reports Fleming made  microbial art paintings,  and the AP reports that after Oxford scientists refined Fleming's discovery, penicillin production was put into high gear in preparation for D-Day in 1944.

Consumption fell last year in the US for the first time since 1994, a 0.9% drop, the Wall Street Journal reports. An industry researcher said baby boomers had driven the good years.  Millennials are just not embracing wine with open arms compared to previous generations,  said Brandy Rand of IWSR.  With the rise in low and no-alcohol products and general consumer trends toward health and wellness, wine is in a tough place.  That generation instead is reaching for cocktails, hard seltzers and nonalcoholic beer, for starters. One forecast for 2019 had predicted this, per Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Saying that millennials weren't drinking up as the industry had expected, the shift was attributed to a host of factors, including  their limited financial capacity, a preference for premium spirits and craft beers, delayed careers, negative health messaging regarding alcohol and the legalization of cannabis.  Or millennials might just have better taste. Sales of wine by value climbed 1.1% last year from 2018.

"(Mar 1, 2016  1:33 PM) While it's far too early to declare the shopping mall  dead  (the New York Times last year cited figures that showed only 20% of America's 1,200 malls have vacancy rates in excess of 10%), there are dead malls. The Detroit Free Press has the fascinating story of what remains of one of them. Southfield, Michigan's Northland Center opened in 1954 as the then-world's largest shopping center, reports Detroit News. It grew to 1.4 million square feet over its 61 years—above ground. Then there are the tunnels. As JC Reindl writes for the Free Press, a miles-long network of service tunnels wind their way beneath, with 484 rooms lurking there as well. They functioned as storage (a Santa Claus statuette, fur coats, and TVs remain in some), workshop areas, and bomb shelters; there was a central power station for the mall, and a police substation. The tunnels are not pretty today: Reindl describes them as  narrow, barely walkable  and pitch black but not, as rumored, teeming with rats. And rats may not have long to find their way there. The city purchased the 114-acre property in December, and the News reports that per the terms of the $2.4 million sale, the site will be razed in anticipation of a sale to a property developer. The tunnels will go with it.

"(Jan 19, 2018  8:33 AM) When Gerald Winters recently decided to reorganize his rare-books store in Bangor, Maine, housing a collection mainly dedicated to Stephen King, he stashed most of his inventory in the basement. He's now suffered what the Bangor Daily News describes as a  devastating blow  to his business: A water main burst near the store, which he'd opened about a year ago, flooding its basement with at least six feet of water and ruining about 90% of his stock. He says there was no time to save anything, telling WGME,  I would have drowned in the water.  Among the washed-out King items: seven original typed manuscripts, dozens of first- and limited-edition books, foreign-language prints, signed tomes, and other hard-to-find ephemera. Some items were so rare they weren't even for sale—he simply kept them on display for his customers.  You can't replace this stuff,  he tells the Daily News. On his store's website, Winters describes how he first became a  Constant Reader,  as King would put it, of King's work after a friend lent him The Stand in 1998.  I was hooked after that,  he says. He details his meticulous gathering of anything King-related over the next 20 years, in which he  would visit every single bookstore in every city I visited and lived.  King himself is distressed about the news.  I'm horrified,  he tells the Daily News.  As a book lover, my heart goes out to him.  He also said he'd see if he could help Winters. In the meantime, Winters has been avoiding phone calls from customers, family, and even his wife, who still lives abroad.  I don't even want to talk to them, because I don't know what to tell them,  he says.  It's a mess.","Guy Spent 20 Years Collecting Stephen King Items.

"(Mar 21, 2017  4:40 AM CDT) Tech company Zapier says San Francisco is a fantastic city—and it would like to encourage its employees to move far away from it. In a blog post, CEO Wade Foster offers a $10,000  de-location  package to new recruits who are struggling with the cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has some of the country's highest rents, but are worried about moving away because they don't want to give up tech career opportunities, ABC7 reports. All of the workplace automation company's employees work remotely, and the firm thinks  you should be able to work wherever you want and still work at a place that helps you achieve your career goals,  Foster writes in the blog post.  I know there are quite a few people in the Bay Area who are new parents looking to find a better standard of living,  Foster tells the San Francisco Chronicle.  It's difficult for a family of four to afford rent, a mortgage, or child care here in the Bay Area. Even if you are a two-income family this can still be difficult.  The $10,000 will be used to reimburse moving expenses in the first three months, according to the fine print, and those who take Zapier up on the offer have to agree to work for the company for at least a year. Foster, who moved to the Bay Area from Missouri five years ago, says he still loves the area but is considering moving away with his wife  because there are benefits of being in a lower cost of living area and being closer to family.

Jeopardy! is saddened to share that Alex Trebek passed away peacefully at home early this morning, surrounded by family and friends,  the show's producers tweeted Sunday.  Thank you, Alex.  Diagnosed in March 2019, Trebek quickly entered chemo and hosted the show for a year despite  massive attacks of great depression that made me wonder if it was really worth fighting on,  he said. He concluded that giving up would only let down other cancer patients, his wife, and God. But he knew the odds of surviving another year with pancreatic cancer were only 7%. Born in Ontario, Canada, Trebek began as a CBC news host and moved on to the high school quiz show Reach for the Top. He soon hosted shows including The Wizard of Odds and High Rollers before landing the Jeopardy! job, where he set a Guinness World record for most episodes hosted (6,829) in June 2014; he hosted over 8,200 in all over 37 seasons, per Variety. He also won five Daytime Emmy Awards for outstanding game show host and was given a Peabody Award for  encouraging, celebrating and rewarding knowledge.

According to witnesses, the child stumbled and fell in between two of the poles and at this point, the snout of at least one of rhinoceroses made contact with the child,  the zoo said in a statement. Witnesses say the girl was rescued by her father.  The dad was holding the little girl and they brought her up and took her out,  Samantha Henkle tells NBC.  She was crying, she looked frightened.  Zoo officials say this is the first such incident since it began offering the experience in 2009.

The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City, and about 2.8 million in the state probably felt the quake, the US Geological Survey reports. There were no initial reports of injuries or major damage to buildings, said Utah Emergency Management spokesman Joe Dougherty. It was the largest quake to hit Utah since a 5.9 magnitude quake shook southern Utah in 1992, per Utah Emergency Management.

Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds.  We're hearing of lights falling down, bookcases falling down, we've heard of water lines breaking inside of buildings,  Dougherty said.

Legal experts say Pistorius could be released after 10 months in jail to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

And as long as the plan can get through the Senate (which it's expected to, with President Jose Mujica's help), marijuana sales would begin in the second half of next year. The price would be roughly $1 per gram, drug chief Julio Calzada told a local paper on Sunday. That's a lot cheaper than what medical marijuana users pay in Washington state right now, the AP points out: about $8 to $14 a gram. For Americans who lack an understanding of what a gram is, that works out to about $3.50 for an eighth, or $28 for an ounce, or $454 for a pound. Calzada helpfully explains it in terms of blunts: A gram is enough  for one marijuana cigarette or two or three slimmer cigarettes.  Only locals would be able to buy it, and they could get their hands on a max of 40 grams a month. Smoking pot has long been legal in Uruguay, but growing, carrying, buying, or selling have not.

The Trump administration is pushing the use of the point-of-care tests, which deliver results within 15 minutes, in K-12 settings so more schools can return to in-person learning, Axios reports. The move will  allow every state on a very regular basis [to] test every teacher who needs it,  Trump said, per CNN. Axios notes students, too, could be tested weekly. Trump said 100 million tests  will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and [as] fast as they can,  while the rest will go to vulnerable communities including nursing homes. Axios notes these types of tests are not as accurate as PCR swab tests, for which results take days.  Governors have the flexibility to use these tests as they deem fit, but we strongly encourage governors to utilize them in settings that are uniquely in need of rapid low-tech point of care tests, like opening and keeping open our K-12 schools, supporting critical infrastructure and first responders, responding to outbreaks specifically in certain demographics or locations, and screening or surveillance in congregate settings,  said the White House's coronavirus testing czar. The move is a reversal from Trump's earlier railing against testing, a point he addressed Monday.  As we massively increase testing capacity, we will identify more cases in asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations. This should not cause undue alarm,  he said.

"(Nov 14, 2013  8:40 AM) Nearly $1 billion spent on a TSA behavioral screening program may have been better spent in Vegas. Started in 2007 at a cost of $200 million a year, the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program trains officers to scan crowded airports for suspicious-looking people. There's just one problem: There's  no evidence behavior detention works,  a GAO report has found, noting the results of identification from SPOT, which employs 3,000 officers across the country, are  the same as or slightly better than chance,  reports NBC News. The report, which looked at 400 studies over 60 years, has called for a slash in funding until the TSA  can provide scientifically validated evidence —but Homeland Security says there's plenty out there. In a response, it said studies supporting behavior detection were left out of the GAO's report and the program's different techniques result in  misleading  conclusions. The TSA calls the program  a common sense approach,  CBS News reports, but Rep. Bennie Thompson tells the Washington Post it  is fundamentally flawed, cannot be proven effective, and should no longer be funded with taxpayer dollars.",TSA's $1B SPOT Program as Effective as Flipping a Coin,TSA's $____B SPOT Program as Effective as Flipping a Coin,1,Copy( 1 ),0
"(Jul 9, 2018  11:05 AM CDT)  This is what we call miracle,  reads a Facebook post from the Missoula County Sheriff's Office in Montana. The reference is to a deputy who heard a faint cry in the woods and discovered a baby buried under sticks and debris, a happy end to a frantic six-hour search at night with temperatures in the 40s.  He followed the sound and found the baby alive, face down,  reads the post. The 5-month-old, wearing only a  wet and soiled onesie,  had actually been in the woods for at least nine hours before being discovered about 2:30am Sunday. Police have charged 32-year-old Francis Crowley with criminal endangerment, and more charges are expected, reports the Missoulian. The ordeal started when police received calls Saturday night in the Lolo Hot Springs area, alleging that Crowley was acting erratically and threatening people. He was gone by the time police arrived, but officers learned that an infant placed in his care (the relationship isn't spelled out) hadn't been seen for hours. Police finally tracked down Crowley thanks to another caller's tip, and though officers say he appeared to be on drugs and was nearly incoherent, he managed to convey that the baby was  somewhere in the mountains,  per the Washington Post. The search then ensued. The baby is in good condition, but it's  especially hard knowing what this small baby endured,  says the sheriff's post.","After 6-Hour Search, Deputy Finds Baby in Woods","After ____-Hour Search, Deputy Finds Baby in Woods",6,Trans( six ),1

Daniel Holtzclaw, 29, was charged in 2014 and found guilty on 18 of 36 counts last month. According to CNN, Holtzclaw found his victims—ranging in age from 17 to 57—in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Oklahoma City and targeted them for their histories with drugs or prostitution, believing that would protect him from accusations. During the trial, 13 women—all black—testified that Holtzclaw threatened to arrest them if they didn't have sex with him, NBC reports. According to the BBC, they felt their lives were in danger. Holtzclaw's attorney had petitioned for a new trial on Wednesday, claiming his client didn't get a fair trial due to evidence being withheld from the defense, NBC reports.

It was  an abuse of power,  Arizona Rep. Kelly Townsend tells KNXV of the scene in Chandler last month. The unvaccinated boy had a fever of 105 degrees when his mother visited a naturopathic doctor, who told her to take him to the emergency room, on Feb. 25, per ABC News. Sarah Beck says the fever subsequently broke, so the two instead returned home. When the doctor learned the boy hadn't been taken to the ER, she notified the Arizona Department of Child Safety, which contacted Chandler Police. Officers say the boy's parents refused to open their door for a welfare check around 10:30pm. They forcibly entered after DCS obtained a court order to seize the child due to a  possible life-threatening illness.  The boy was taken to a hospital and diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection, not meningitis as the doctor suspected, Townsend tells KNXV.  Parents felt the child was fine. Next thing we know, the Gestapo is at their door,  she adds, per the Arizona Republic, noting the parents  may have been targeted by the medical community because they hadn't vaccinated their children.

Prosecutors say in a statement today the parts  are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17.  Prosecutors have previously said they are treating a missile strike as the most likely scenario, but today's announcement was the first time they have described possible physical evidence of a missile. However, they cautioned that the conclusion cannot yet be drawn  that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17.  Reuters reports the Dutch Safety Board is currently in possession of the parts. The BBC in June quoted Russian defense firm Almaz-Antey as having assessed shrapnel damage and concluding a BUK missile that it ceased manufacturing in 1999 was used to bring down the flight.

"(Jun 27, 2017  3:08 AM CDT) The New Mexico Department of Health on Monday confirmed two more human cases of plague. The recent cases involve a 52-year-old woman and a 62-year-old woman. The first case this year was reported in early June in a 63-year-old man. All three patients, who live in Santa Fe County, were hospitalized but there have been no deaths. State public health veterinarian Paul Ettestad says plague can be present in fleas that infest wild rodents in Santa Fe County, including within the city limits of Santa Fe and in other locations around New Mexico.  Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk,  he says. Health workers are conducting environmental investigations around the homes of the three patients to look for ongoing risk and to ensure the safety of the immediate family members and neighbors, the AP reports. Plague generally is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas but can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals including rodents and pets. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hundreds of cases have been documented over the last century in the western US, typically in northern New Mexico, northwestern Arizona, and southern Colorado.

That's because he makes much of the 23-mile journey on foot, resulting in a 21-mile round-trip walk every day, the Detroit Free Press reports. His car broke down about a decade ago and he's been walking ever since, combining the slog with bus rides in the few areas where buses are available. Once he's worked from 2pm to 10pm, he heads home again in the dark, normally arriving around 4am. With some buses shut down for the day by that point, he walks a total of 13 miles, the Free Press notes. Faith and determination keep him going, he says. He was mugged once, his boss says, though Robertson himself only mentions that he walks through some dangerous areas. But the many miles have their benefits: He loves his co-workers, and his boss's wife cooks him dinner every night.  She takes care of James. And he's a personal favorite of the owners because of his attendance record,  says the plant manager at Schain Mold & Engineering. That record is perfect.  I set our attendance standard by this man,  the manager says. And this story has a happy ending. Now that Robertson's story is known, people are coming to his aid. Yesterday's front-page Free Press story spurred a number of crowdfunding efforts, which as of last night had brought in more than $30,000, the paper reports. Others offered him rides.

"(Jun 6, 2017  4:40 PM CDT) Ge Kun, a Chinese dairy firm executive, has been missing for more than two months. But, she's not alone: China Huishan Dairy now states it's also missing approximately $357 million in cash, CNN reports. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ge sent a letter dated March 21 to the Huishan chairman and hasn't been seen since. The letter said  recent work stress had taken a toll on her health.  Ge was an executive director and co-owner of the company and in charge of everything from human resources to branding, including treasury and cash operations. Huishan announced this week that its accounts reveal it should have $426 million in cash or cash equivalents, but its bank states it only has $69 million. Ge's disappearance and the missing money are part of a horrible six-month stretch for Huishan, which claims it runs more dairy farms than any other company in China. In December, a US investment research firm accused Huishan of fraud and reporting fake profits. And a few days after Ge's letter, the company's stock lost 85% of its value in a single day, Reuters reports. The drop is still unexplained. In the weeks since, nine out of 10 board members have left Huishan, the company's debt has ballooned to $3.9 billion, and 16 new legal proceedings have started against it. Huishan has filed a missing person's report for Ge and states it will hire a forensic accountant to investigate the  significant discrepancy  in its cash situation.","Missing Exec, $357M Cash Just Part of Dairy Co's Very Bad Year","Missing Exec, $____M Cash Just Part of Dairy Co's Very Bad Year",357,Copy( 357 ),0

The AP reports that Lewis' death was confirmed in a Friday night statement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Per USA Today, Lewis, who was often called  the conscience of Congress,  had been suffering from late-stage pancreatic cancer since December. Images of Lewis being beaten by state troopers in Selma, Ala., as he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge with other civil rights advocates on March 7, 1965 (aka  Bloody Sunday ), a violent incident that left him bloodied and with a fractured skull, moved the nation and spurred support for the Voting Rights Act, per the New York Times. After his turn as a community activist, Lewis was elected to Congress in 1986, becoming only the second African American from Georgia to make it to Congress since Reconstruction. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2011 from President Barack Obama, who said that  generations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind.  During his time in Congress, Lewis was known for his advocacy of voting rights. One of his most famous pieces of advice:  Get into trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble.

"(Mar 26, 2020  10:55 AM CDT) Louisiana had already banned gatherings of more than 50 people before Gov. John Bel Edwards announced a statewide order against groups of more than 10 on Sunday. But the first order didn't stop a pastor from herding a claimed 1,000 people into his church week after week, and it's not clear that the second will result in any change. Rev. Tony Spell of Central City's Life Tabernacle Church says roughly 1,000 congregants, bused in from five different parishes, have been gathering each Sunday in defiance of state and federal recommendations, while a few hundred more enjoy additional services each Tuesday.  If they close every door in this city, then I will close my doors,  Spell told CNN shortly before hosting congregrants on Tuesday.  But you can't say the retailers are essential but the church is not. That is a persecution of the faith.  Spell previously claimed the COVID-19 pandemic was  politically motivated  while  the church is a hospital for the sick,  per CNN. He also said a police officer had threatened to send in the National Guard to break up services, which he has no intention of stopping until forced. Chief Roger Corcoran of the Central Police Department, however, says  that was never told to the pastor by my officer.  He adds the  matter is under investigation.  There appeared to be far fewer than 1,000 congregants at Sunday's outdoor service, which was livestreamed hours before Edwards' latest order was to take effect, though Spell tells CNN the congregants were scattered across in different areas.  We're doing our best to keep everyone safe,  Spell said at one point, noting social distancing guidelines. Later scenes, though, showed those in attendance were clearly breaking those guidelines, per USA Today.","Pastor Rallies Hundreds, Claims COVID-19 Is 'Political'","Pastor Rallies Hundreds, Claims COVID-____ Is 'Political'",19,Copy( 19 ),0

A lawsuit from Frank Sivero alleges that Simpsons writers were living next door to him in 1989, when he was working on the Carbone character, and they ripped off his  appearance and mannerisms  for the character Louie, who first appeared as one of Fat Tony's henchmen in the Springfield Mafia in a 1991 episode, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Sivero—who claims producer James L. Brooks promised him a future connected to The Simpsons and even a movie—wants $100 million for  improper interference,  $50 million for the loss of his likeness, $50 million for  improper appropriation  of his  confidential idea,  and another $50 million in exemplary damages, reports Deadline—which notes that the Louie character does look a lot like Sivero's character.

"(Mar 21, 2016  11:37 AM CDT) A group of more than 40 millionaires in New York state has written to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top lawmakers calling on them to consider raising taxes on the state's wealthiest residents to address poverty and rebuild failing infrastructure. The letter, a copy of which was given to the AP, proposes new, higher tax rates for the top 1% of earners. The letter goes on to say additional revenue is needed to tackle child poverty, homelessness, and aging bridges, tunnels, waterlines, and roads.  As New Yorkers who have contributed to and benefited from the economic vibrancy of our state, we have both the ability and the responsibility to pay our fair share,  the letter states.  We can well afford to pay our current taxes, and we can afford to pay even more.  Those signing the letter include Abigail Disney, Leo Hindery, and Steven C. Rockefeller. The tax plan, known as the one-percent tax plan, was worked out in conjunction with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning economic think tank. The one-percent plan would create new, higher tax rates for those making $665,000 or more. Currently, single filers making more than $1,062,000 pay the state's top rate of 8.82%. Under the one-percent plan, the 8.82% would apply to anyone making $1 million to $2 million, and higher rates of 9.35%, 9.65%, and 9.99% would apply to those making $2 million to $10 million, $10 million to $100 million, and more than $100 million, respectively. Their proposal faces significant obstacles in the state Legislature.

The dog was said to be near death, and the county animal control was not responding to reports of the situation. So Rodriguez and two others took the dog—and got charged with dog larceny, a felony, after the dog was reported stolen on Jan. 11, 2015. Rodriguez's trial began Wednesday, the Virginian-Pilot reports, and she faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. But the trial was continued for a month after odd circumstances Thursday: The alleged owner of the dog showed up at the courthouse but left before it was his turn to testify, WAVY reports. Rodriguez and her cohorts were turned in by a passerby who saw three people take the chained dog, then flee when he confronted them. Animal lovers in Virginia Beach say this is just one of many incidents in which a dog is left in poor conditions.  Have we reached the point where people from outside the area feel the need to come and steal a dog because they think things are that bad and that nothing is being done?  says one man who formed a volunteer organization to help struggling pet owners after this incident.  There’s a right way and a wrong way to rescue dogs,  he adds. What Rodriguez allegedly did  was the wrong way.

Berkshire has been a significant P&G shareholder since the consumer products firm acquired Gillette in 2005, but the Duracell acquisition will use nearly all of Berkshire's 52.48 million shares; Buffett has estimated that Berkshire's P&G stake cost it roughly $336 million.  I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,  Buffett said in a statement today. Berkshire already owns a number of well-known consumer brands in its portfolio of more than 80 businesses, including Fruit of the Loom, Geico, Helzberg Diamonds, and half of the HJ Heinz Co.

He tells CNN that the restaurant, which he opened in October 2019,  was a tribute to my mother, and everything was going great until March, when we were forced to shut down.  The restaurant has since reopened, but as Salloukh explains in a Facebook post, things haven't been the same.  This is not an ordinary December,  he writes.  Normally this is a month when our employees work extra and guests tip generously. December is a month for them to earn money to buy family gifts, put a bit into savings, and take care of bills or repairs that have been lingering. With COVID restrictions and guidelines, that was not going to happen for them this year.  Enter  Billy,  who came in on Dec. 12, ate his meal, then settled his bill.

The Republican state senator narrowly defeated Democratic rival Dan McCready in a special election in the state's 9th Congressional District, sparing Republicans an embarrassing loss in a district President Trump carried by 12 points in 2016, the New York Times reports. GOP candidate Mark Harris led McCready by 905 votes after last year's election, but the result was never certified and the state election board ordered a do-over after evidence of ballot tampering involving a Harris operative surfaced. With most ballots counted Tuesday night, Bishop, best known as the author of the state's controversial  bathroom bill,  was ahead by around 2 percentage points. Ahead of the election, outside GOP groups poured more than $5 million into the district, which has been Republican since 1963. Trump held a rally for Bishop on Monday night.  Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race,  the president tweeted Tuesday, though the AP notes that the race was long considered too close to call and no publicly released polls showed Bishop 17 points down. Analysts say the narrow result in a GOP stronghold shows that the party might still struggle in next year's election.

That's what the Swedish city of Kiruna has decided because iron mining below it has weakened the foundations of houses and buildings, Tech Insider reports. Now LKAB, the state-owned company behind the mining, is dedicating billions of dollars to moving Kiruna about 2 miles east. The ongoing 30-year plan includes relocating 21 particular buildings (like Kiruna's city hall and its attractive church) and paying residents to have their homes demolished and rebuilt at the new location, the Guardian reported last year. An Arctic city that's in darkness most of the year, Kiruna  will be a bit like a walking millipede with a thousand feet, moving, crawling, slowly ... toward the east,  says an architect in a promotional video for the plan. Critics say social networks will be shattered by the move and relocated residents will have higher rents, but on the bright side, the new city is supposed to be more walkable and economically diverse. Plus there's a lot at stake: Founded partly by LKAB in 1900, the city of 18,000 supplies the European Union with 90% of its iron.  There might be some concerns, but the mine has to keep operating,  a resident says. It's not a first, either: Cities have been relocated before for economic or safety reasons, and other towns are considering moves over climate change, the New York Times notes.

How St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar put it to reporters: His  assumption,  based on where the officers were and the trajectory of the bullets, is that  these shots were directed exactly at my officers.  The shots were fired as what had earlier been a crowd of about 70 people began to dwindle, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Some protesters fell to the ground and others ran. A huge police presence, including officers in riot gear, later surrounded the department.

Attackers armed with AK-47s, grenades, and in some cases explosive vests hit the prison directorate and the justice and education ministries. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assaults, saying they were in response to the treatment of Taliban prisoners. Four gunmen burst into the justice ministry and opened fire, with two surviving the ensuing gunfight to capture the upper floors.

"(Oct 21, 2008  1:48 AM CDT) The longest-serving Supreme Court justice may defy expectations and stay on the bench even if fellow Chicagoan Barack Obama is elected, the Chicago Tribune writes. Many observers believe that liberal-leaning John Paul Stevens, 88, would choose to step down and let Obama choose his successor. But others think he may stay another four years and become the longest-serving justice in American history—as testament to his devotion to the job, rather than out of pride. Whether he stays or goes, associates say the Ford-appointed Republican will be glad to outlast the term legitimized by the Bush vs Gore presidential race decision he bitterly opposed.  We may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner,  Stevens wrote in 2000, but  the identity of the loser is perfectly clear—the nation's confidence in a judge as an impartial guardian.","SC Justice, 88, May Break Term Record Under Obama","SC Justice, ____, May Break Term Record Under Obama",88,Copy( 88 ),0
"(Jan 24, 2016  6:59 AM) A large chunk of metal that could be from an aircraft washed ashore in southern Thailand, but Malaysian authorities on Sunday cautioned against speculation of a link to a Malaysia Airlines flight missing almost two years. Flight MH370 is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean, and only one piece of debris has been identified as coming from the plane, a slab of wing that washed ashore on Reunion Island in the western Indian Ocean last July. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said he instructed Malaysian civil aviation officials to contact Thailand about the newly found wreckage, a curved piece of metal measuring about 6 ½ feet by 10 feet with electrical wires hanging from it and numbers stamped on it in several places.  The markings, engineering, and tooling apparent in this debris strongly suggest that it is aerospace related,  an editor with Flightglobal tells Reuters.  It will need to be carefully examined, however, to determine it's exact origin.  Thailand's Transportation Ministry said four Malaysian officials and two Thai experts will visit the site Monday. Liow said the search for the missing jet, which carried 239 people, is ongoing in the southern Indian Ocean. Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokesman Dan O'Malley said the agency was awaiting an official examination of the debris. The debris was found on the eastern coast of southern Thailand's Nakkon Si Thammarat province, about 370 miles south of Bangkok on the Gulf of Thailand. While debris can drift thousands of miles on ocean currents, that location would be a surprise based on the data from Flight MH370. The plane was tracked by radar flying over the South China Sea then making a sharp turn west. It crossed the Malay Peninsula and Straits of Malacca, which would put it off Thailand's west coast.","Metal Hunk Washes Up, Raises Slim Hope for MH370","Metal Hunk Washes Up, Raises Slim Hope for MH____",370,Copy( 370 ),0

The plane roaring over people's heads at the country's first air show Sunday was actually a remote-controlled mock-up of the fabled US Air Force fighter, the AP reports. The choice of flying a one-sixth scale model F-16 at the Wonsan International Friendship Air Festival was an odd one considering the outrage North Korea regularly expresses over the presence of US troops and Air Force bases in South Korea. Officials refused to comment on the origin of the model F-16. The model fighter did, however, appear to please the crowd watching the air displays Sunday at Wonsan's newly renovated Kalma Airport. Thousands of North Koreans and hundreds of foreign tourists and journalists invited to the event were also given a rare glimpse of North Korea's own air force fighters, including a MiG-29 and Su-25 ground attack fighter, acquired from Russia. The air show's first day opened Saturday with an aerobatic display by US-made Hughes MD 500 military-use helicopters, which has raised questions of whether international sanctions against North Korea had been violated.

The magnitude-6.8 earthquake hit near Nagano city shortly after 10 pm at a depth of 6 miles, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The US Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2. Since the quake occurred inland, there was no possibility of a tsunami. But a local restaurant owner tells Japanese media he has  never experienced a quake that shook so hard.

"(Jul 3, 2015  1:40 PM CDT) A British teenager's toilet phobia appears to have cost her her life. The 16-year-old girl suffered a heart attack after going without a bowel movement for eight weeks, reports the Independent. Authorities say her chronic constipation resulted in distended organs and a compressed chest cavity, factors that contributed to her cardiac arrest. An autopsy revealed a  massive extension of the large bowel,  says the pathologist who examined Emily Titterington. It was  like nothing I have seen before—it was dramatic.  The teen was mildly autistic and had a lifelong history of what Medical Daily calls  stool withholding,  a behavior that usually passes after early childhood. Emily's mother said she had been pleading with her daughter before her death to have a thorough medical exam, but the teen refused. The family doctor had prescribed laxatives but acknowledges that he didn't examine the girl's abdomen. A paramedic who responded to Emily's home the night of her death—it was actually the second call by her parents that night—found the teen's abdomen  grossly extended.  One doctor not involved with the case tells People that  there's more than meets the eye here.  The teen  probably had some electrolyte abnormality, or a cardiac arrhythmia from something else.

"(Sep 16, 2013  7:12 AM CDT) Think about this the next time you drive over a bridge: An AP analysis of 607,380 bridges in the most recent federal National Bridge Inventory showed that 65,605 were classified as  structurally deficient  and 20,808 as  fracture critical.  A bridge is deemed fracture critical when it doesn't have redundant protections and is at risk of collapse if a single, vital component fails; it's structurally deficient when it is in need of rehabilitation or replacement because at least one major component of the span has advanced deterioration or other problems that lead inspectors to deem its condition poor or worse. Of those, 7,795 were both structurally deficient and fracture critical—a combination of red flags that experts say indicate significant disrepair and similar risk of collapse. The AP looked at those bridges, which carry more than 29 million drivers a day. They're located in all 50 states (among them: New York's Brooklyn Bridge) and many were built more than 60 years ago. Cities and states would like to replace the aging and vulnerable bridges, but few have the money; nationally, it is a multibillion-dollar problem. Of course, engineers and officials say the bridges are safe, but the Interstate 5 bridge in Washington state that collapsed in May was fracture critical and the Minneapolis bridge that collapsed in 2007 was structurally deficient.

The two planes were part of a formation of three and they crashed just before 11:30 local time after they touched each other in the air, according to Meinrad Stoecklin, a spokesman for police in Basel-Landschaft. The airshow in the village of Dittingen near Basel was temporarily interrupted as rescue teams raced to the scene of the crash, police said. It was not immediately clear if there were more injured people. Swiss media reported that one pilot managed to escape by parachute. The two planes were part of a formation of three planes, but the third plane of the formation was not involved in the crash and landed safely, they reported. Yesterday, seven people died and more than a dozen were injured after a military jet participating in an airshow in the UK crashed into a busy road. The Hawker Hunter fighter jet, which was participating in the Shoreham Airshow near Brighton in southern England, hit several vehicles on a nearby road as it crashed.

"(Jan 5, 2015  7:20 AM) It's both a New Year tradition and New Year killer: The Japanese eat an average of about 2 pounds of chewy rice cakes called mochi each year, most during the first week in January. And each year, a handful of people choke to death on them. This year's toll was especially severe as compared to recent years: AFP reports by way of local media that as of Friday nine people had died and another 13 were hospitalized; the last two years saw a total of six reported deaths by mochi. The Guardian reports that all but about 20% of the victims are typically elderly, and Japan Today earlier reported that the six people who were taken to Tokyo-area hospitals on Thursday ranged in age from their 50s to their 90s. The sticky rice cakes are generally added to  ozouni  soup over the holidays, but they can also be toasted and wrapped in dried seaweed. The country's police and fire services advise the elderly to cut the mochi into small pieces and never eat it alone. In a 2011 look at the  silent killer,  the Wall Street Journal explained why the elderly are more susceptible to mochi-related deaths, which it describes as the leading cause of food-related suffocation: Age chips away at their  mastication abilities and saliva secretion,  making it easier for a bite of the glutinous cake to get lodged in the throat. In advance of last year's new year, the Guardian reported that companies have been hustling to create a version that incorporates an enzyme that reduces the stickiness without sacrificing mochi's starchy flavor.

"(Jan 6, 2020  6:18 AM) 60 Minutes took an investigative look into the death of Jeffrey Epstein on Sunday night—including the airing of graphic photos from his cell and autopsy—and the program won't exactly be ending conspiracy theories that Epstein was murdered. To be clear, the show did not turn up any proof to refute the official ruling of suicide. But it interviews former New York City Medical Examiner Michael Baden, who has been hired by Epstein's brother and who doesn't think the injuries suffered by Epstein mesh with the suicide narrative.  There were fractures of the left, the right thyroid cartilage and the left hyoid bone,  he says.  I have never seen three fractures like this in a suicidal hanging.  He added:  Going over a thousand jail hangings, suicides in the New York City state prisons over the past 40-50 years, no one had three fractures.  In Baden's view, the evidence points  much more to murder and strangulation,  but the city medical examiner's office says it is  firmly  standing by its ruling of suicide. The neck fractures in question can indeed be found in both homicide and suicide victims, says the office. Another interviewee is Cameron Lindsay, a former federal warden, who says there's  absolutely, unequivocally  no way Epstein was murdered in his cell. One interesting nugget unveiled by CBS: a note handwritten by Epstein and found in his cell. It is not a suicide note. It instead, it ticks off a few complaints by the famous inmate.

Authorities say the five men from Rosario, all in their late 40s, were riding bikes when Sayfullo Saipov drove a rented pickup truck down a bike path near the World Trade Center, running over cyclists and pedestrians, the Washington Post reports. A sixth member of the group was hospitalized in stable condition.  We accompany the families in this terrible moment of deep pain, which all Argentines share,  the Argentine government said in a statement. According to Argentine media, one of the victims, steel firm owner Ariel Erlij, helped pay for the group's trip to New York, which was described as the  trip of their dreams.  Three other people were killed in the attack, including a Belgian woman who was visiting New York with her mother and sister, the Guardian reports. Authorities say at least 11 people were injured, though two children injured when Saipov drove the pickup into a school bus were not seriously hurt. Lawyer Tom Kendrick tells the New York Times that he encountered the gruesome aftermath of the rampage while jogging. He says he saw a mangled bike and a body, and then three bodies close together.  I approached to see if I could help and they did not need help—they appeared to be dead,  he says.

"(Jun 7, 2012  1:50 PM CDT) OK, it's official, the general election season has begun: Nate Silver has started forecasting it. The stats guru today unveiled his first, tenuous prediction for the 2012 race: That President Obama is ever so slightly favored to win a second term. The model currently gives Obama a 60% chance of victory, but  the edge could easily swing to Mitt Romney on the basis of further bad economic news,  Silver writes in his New York Times blog. Silver thinks the race will likely hang on a  mere handful of states,  chief among them Ohio and Virginia. The next tier of battlegrounds is Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, and Pennsylvania; perennial battleground Florida  may be a less valuable prize than usual,  because it's fairly likely to go Romney. Wisconsin, likewise, is  over-hyped as a swing state,  despite Scott Walker's recall win.

Some 2,200 employees were told they would be out of work just hours before the stores shut their doors around 7pm, CNNMoney reports.  Everybody just panicked and started crying,  says a manager at one of the closed stores in Pico Rivera, Calif., who wonders whether the closure is actually punishment for employee protests for higher pay. Some employees from other closed locations are also suspicious, though a Walmart rep tells the Consumerist plumbing is the problem and  we aim to reopen these stores as soon as these issues are resolved.   This is the first time we're hearing of their sewer problems,  says Pico Rivera's city manager. The Pico Rivera store was a hub of the pro-union OUR Walmart movement and the first to stage a walkout over wages in 2012. A plumbing technician at the now-closed Brandon, Fla., location tells WFLA that  it wouldn't take six months to replace a whole sewer line in that store.  WFTS reports that Walmart hasn't applied for plumbing permits in any of the five affected cities; Walmart says that's because it isn't yet sure what repairs are necessary.

Washington Post columnist John Kelly takes a fascinating look at Williamson's quest, which started at age 14 after he received an atlas that outlined each of the country's counties as a gift. Alaska was the toughest state for him to conquer: It required three separate trips, one of which involved 29 flights.  I tried not to think about the money.

"(Oct 17, 2014  12:40 PM CDT) If you've lately found yourself wondering when the worst drought North America has suffered occurred, here's your answer: 1934. At least, as far as the last millennium goes. In a new NASA study, scientists say that a combination of atmospheric conditions (a high pressure ridge off the West Coast that blocked wet weather) and dust storms (the product of grass-eviscerating activities like overfarming and overgrazing that left topsoil susceptible to wind) culminated in the most severe drought in the past 1,000 years. In fact, the Dust Bowl drought of 1934 was so bad that it was 30% worse than the next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580, reports Nature. Scientists drew this conclusion using an analysis of tree rings between the years 1000 and 2005. The 1934 drought extended across 71.6% of Western North America, while the extent of 2012's drought didn't quite reach 60%. As io9 reports, drought led to 14 dust storms in 1932 and 38 in 1933, but farmers kept working the land, expecting rain to return.  As it turns out, the successive dust storms were making the droughts even worse.  NASA explains why:  Dust clouds reflect sunlight and block solar energy from reaching the surface. That prevents evaporation that would otherwise help form rain clouds, meaning that the presence of the dust clouds themselves leads to less rain.  While the agricultural practices that led to those dust storms are no longer used today, scientists say the risk of droughts is only going up, and that agricultural producers will need to adapt accordingly. (The latest drought, meanwhile, is actually causing the West to rise.)",Scientists Pinpoint Worst Drought in 1K Years,Scientists Pinpoint Worst Drought in ____K Years,1,"Paraphrase( 1,000 , K )",1

But the search continues there, and the US Navy's Bluefin-21 has finally pulled off a  full mission  on its third attempt to do so, following issues with sea depth and technical problems, NBC News reports. The undersea drone has now covered some 35 square miles of the 230-square-mile search area, and its data is currently being analyzed. As of yesterday, there were  no significant detections,  officials note. And though it was expected to wrap up about now, the search by air and ship also continues, which Reuters suggests is due to continued pressure from families holding out hope floating wreckage will be spotted. As for cost, reports earlier this month said $44 million had been spent, and an Australian official now estimates that if private companies run the search, it could have a  ballpark  price tag of $234 million.  There'll come a time when we need to regroup and reconsider,  says Malaysia's acting transport minister.  But in any event, the search will always continue.

They'd been among a group of 10 surfers and swimmers who set out Monday evening in the Scheveningen district, which borders the North Sea.

The seven puppies—the survivors of 19 embryos implanted in the mother, notes the Guardian—are a mix of beagle, Labrador, and cocker spaniel and are now healthy 5-month-olds. All were adopted except for one female who's being kept by the lab to have her own litter. The lab kept track of the puppies by painting their nails with different color polish. Travis adopted two, still known by their nail polish names, Red and Green. In vitro fertilization has been possible in humans since 1978, but IVF efforts with dogs repeatedly failed until now.  The biology of the dog is really, really different than humans,  says a reproductive physiologist for the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, which works with Cornell, hailing the birth as a  huge breakthrough.  Dog pregnancies last only two months and females go into heat just once or twice a year, releasing immature eggs instead of mature eggs needed for IVF. To compensate, researchers left eggs in the dogs' oviducts a day longer than normal, notes the Guardian, allowing them to mature.

I wish God would have took me before they took her. I wish I would have gotten shot,  says Gallegos. The couple's four children are three girls ages 1, 4, and 8, and a 14-year-old boy. The younger children  don't know what's going on,  the boy tells the San Francisco Chronicle.  But my older sister, she's just trying to hold it down, like me.  A reward of up to $30,000 is being offered for information leading to the shooter.

"(Feb 19, 2020  7:15 PM) Two women were killed this week when the car they were sitting in fell off a ferry in Miami. The car sank to the bottom of the 50-foot channel, the Herald reports, where Miami-Dade Fire Rescue divers found their bodies. It's not clear how the Mercedes went into the water, but a witness said the ferry was open at both ends. The 113-foot ferry's trip from Fisher Island to Miami Beach takes only 7 minutes. The ferry, the Pelican, passed a Coast Guard inspection in 2018. With the exception of a yacht, the ferry is the only way to reach the island, a wealthy enclave of fewer than 500 residents. The Coast Guard and Miami-Dade police are investigating. The victims in the Tuesday afternoon accident were socialites Emma Afra, 63, who lived on Fisher Island, and Viviane Brahms, 75, per Vanity Fair. Afra was involved in several local charities.  The entire Fisher Island community mourns their loss,  the president of the island association said.","Miami Ferry Loses Car, Killing 2 Women Inside","Miami Ferry Loses Car, Killing ____ Women Inside",2,Trans( Two ),1

According to the Denver Post, more than two-dozen survivors and parents of those killed sued the theater chain for not hiring armed guards, not having enough security cameras, and generally failing to protect theater-goers from shooter James Holmes. An Arapahoe County jury ruled against the victims last month, clearing the way for Cinemark to seek reimbursement for $699,187 in legal costs. A judge still has to approve that amount, and asking for the money may be a play on Cinemark's part to keep the victims from appealing the ruling. Another group of victims suing Cinemark in federal court had its case dismissed Friday by a judge who put the blame for the shooting squarely on Holmes, the Aurora Sentinel reports. Cinemark, the third largest theater chain in the country, will also be able to seek reimbursement for legal fees in that case, though it hasn't yet.",Theater Wants $700K From Aurora Shooting Victims,Theater Wants $____K From Aurora Shooting Victims,700,"Paraphrase( 700,000 , K )",1

James tells KOIN 6 that Eugenio told her without that cash, he couldn't afford living expenses or Christmas gifts for his two young kids. James advised him to visit his local branch the next day, Christmas Eve, to have the hold lifted—but when he went, the bank manager was on vacation and no one else could lift the hold. He called James back in frustration and happened to mention he was at a gas station about 15 miles away from the call center.  I wish I had just $20 bucks to get home,  Eugenio says he told James.

In January, a 3-year-old in New Mexico wounded both his parents with one gun shot. In June, a 3-year-old in Michigan died after shooting himself in the head with a gun he found in a closet. In August, a 21-month-old in St. Louis died after shooting himself in the torso at his grandma's house. Just this month, a 2-year-old in South Carolina found a gun in the backseat of the car and shot his grandma, who was riding in the passenger seat. Reporter Christopher Ingraham crunched the numbers for the Post and found at least 43 cases of toddlers shooting themselves or others with a firearm in the news this year. According to Ingraham's stats, 13 toddlers killed themselves, 18 injured themselves, 10 injured someone else, and two killed someone else. He says there are likely many more cases of toddlers firing a gun that didn't make the news. According to one gun safety advocacy group, more than two-thirds of accidental shootings by children could be prevented with responsible gun storage. And 67% of Americans support laws requiring guns to be locked up at home, a measure the NRA opposes.

The White House also placed new sanctions on Russia's FSB and GRU intelligence agencies, according to AFP. The agencies are believed to have been involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee and others. Finally, the administration is closing Russian compounds in Maryland and New York believed to be used for intelligence purposes. The Times calls it the  strongest American response ever taken to a state-sponsored cyberattack.  Obama calls the response both  necessary and appropriate.   I have ordered a number of actions in response to the Russian government's aggressive harassment of US officials and cyber operations aimed at the US election,  Obama said in a statement. The State Department says US officials in Moscow are regularly harassed by Russian security agents and traffic police; Thursday's actions are in response to that on top of election-related hacking. The move puts the onus on Donald Trump to lift the sanctions when he takes office, officially signalling that US intelligence agencies can't be trusted. When asked about the situation Wednesday, Trump said:  The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on.",US Boots 35 Russian Diplomats Over Election-Related Hacking,US Boots ____ Russian Diplomats Over Election-Related Hacking,35,Copy( 35 ),0

Taylor was known for his rhyming skills and his status as what the magazine calls the  high-pitched, gruff vocal counterpoint to [bandmate] Q-Tip's smooth, mellow flow.  Although an official cause of death has yet to be announced, the magazine notes that Taylor had suffered from various health issues, including diabetes that spurred a 2008 kidney transplant.  It's really a sickness,  Taylor said in an interview for an ATCQ rap documentary by actor/director Michael Rapaport.  Like straight-up drugs. I'm just addicted to sugar.  Taylor helped found A Tribe Called Quest with best friend Q-Tip (whom he grew up with in Queens, NY), Jarobi White, and producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and the group put out five studio albums in total, starting with 1990's People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm and ending with 1998's The Love Movement. He also released one solo album, Ventilation: Da LP, in 2000 and had been working on a new album, Give Thanks, due out this year. The group performed  Can I Kick It?  live on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show in November, which was their first TV performance in 15 years. E!

Helen Dove, 31, impersonated 15 people and sent thousands of emails in an elaborate scheme against 43-year-old Kimberley Baker—all while they were so close that Dove became Baker's main bridesmaid, the court heard.  She was my best friend, she was someone I was with 24/7, that did everything with me,  Baker tells the Liverpool Echo.  She went on holiday with us, looked after the kids with me, took the kids to school, so I had no reason not to believe her.  Dove and Baker apparently met two years ago at a riding school, where Baker said her dream was to work in children's services. That's when Dove falsely claimed to be an adoption worker. Soon Dove claimed jobs were available with her supposed employer, a children's services department, so Baker took a voluntary redundancy from her job—and was dragged along for seven months as Dove impersonated employees, forged bank statements, and falsified employment contracts in what appeared to be a drawn-out hiring process. Dove's lawyer claims she did it as  a desperate and misguided attempt  to keep Baker's friendship because Dove had no family and  craved that domestic closeness.  But Dove pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and was sentenced to 2 years, 8 months, along with a $2,000 fine.  I was heartbroken,  says Baker, a mother of three.

Unfortunately for Avelina Lesper, she became that person over the weekend at Mexico City's famous Zona Maco event, destroying a piece of art by Gabriel Rico, who is described by Artnet News as  one of the country's up-and-coming artists.  Lesper, an art critic, was leading a tour Saturday through the Galeria OMR stand at the fair when she reportedly set her Coke can on one of the stone tiles next to the sculpture so she could take a picture of the piece by Rico. That's when the 2018 sculpture—a sheet of glass with a tennis ball, soccer ball, stone, and other  found  items suspended inside of it—turned into a pile of glass shards.  We are very sad and disappointed,  Galeria OMR said in a statement, adding:  We don't understand how an alleged professional art critic destroyed a work.  Rico called it a  regrettable situation  that was  very disrespectful.  Lesper, said by Artnews to be a known  provocateur,  says that she didn't put the soda can on the sculpture itself but next to it, that the can was empty, and that she didn't destroy the piece on purpose.  It was like the work heard my comment and felt what I thought of it,  she said, per the Guardian.  The work shattered into pieces and collapsed and fell on the floor.  Lesper says she suggested the gallery take advantage of the situation and display the glass shards to show the  evolution  of the piece; the gallery declined.

That king was Edward VIII, most famously known for abdicating so that he could marry divorcee Wallis Simpson. But before he did so, an  abdication crisis  broke out, leading Britain's Home Office (which oversees police, MI5, etc) to order that all calls between his residence at Fort Belvedere or Buckingham Palace and  the continent of Europe  be intercepted; at the time, Simpson was bunking with friends in France. It appears the bugging of calls was short-lived: A  Most Secret  memo confirming the interception is dated Dec. 5, 1936, reports the AFP; Edward, who had not yet been formally crowned, stepped down on Dec. 10, ending a 326-day reign.

AL.com, which reports the board voted Friday to give Culverhouse his money back, notes that both of Culverhouse's parents are UA alumni, and that they both were staunch supporters of women's reproductive rights—his father was even an active Planned Parenthood officer when Culverhouse Jr. was young. A UA release, however, cites an  ongoing dispute,  accusing Culverhouse of making  numerous demands  on how the university's law school was to spend his donation, and asking for $10 million of it back. The release also says none of the problems had anything to do with the new abortion law. Culverhouse refutes that.  I expected this response from UA,  he says in a statement, per AL.com.  I want to make clear that I never demanded that $21.5 million be refunded and wonder if the University is attempting to silence my opinions by their quick response. I will not be silenced.

He has introduced a bill that would do away with the law that says kids can have a maximum of two legal parents, reports the Sacramento Bee. So if a lesbian couple conceived a baby with a male friend's help and he stayed in the picture, or if a pregnant woman started dating a man who raised the child in tandem with the biological father, all three people in each case could be deemed parents. The move would make things easier for judges, who, under current California law, must decide which two parents have rights when three or more are arguing about things like custody and child support. Of course, it could make some things messier, too, like tax dedications, school notifications, and Social Security rights.  The bill brings California into the 21st century, recognizing that there are more than Ozzie and Harriet families today,  says the Democrat.

Sheriff Tony Spurlock says the suspects—one adult and one juvenile—were taken into custody within around two minutes of reports of shots being fired at the STEM School Highlands Ranch, the Denver Post reports. Authorities say an 18-year-old man was killed and eight other students were injured.  We know that two individuals walked into the STEM School, got deep inside the school and engaged students in two separate locations,  Spurlock says.  There were a number of students that were shot and injured.  The adult in custody has been named as Devon Erickson, 18. Spurlock says the injured students are all age 15 or older, the AP reports.

A legal loophole intended for making commemorative coins, he writes in the New York Times, could come in handy: Thanks to the rule, the US Treasury is legally allowed to mint coins of any denomination. And  by minting a $1 trillion coin, then depositing it at the Fed, the Treasury could acquire enough cash to sidestep the debt ceiling—while doing no economic harm at all.  Sure, it's a  gimmick,  but it makes as much sense as the debt ceiling, which lets Congress  tell the president to spend money, then tell him that he can’t raise the money he’s supposed to spend.  Over at Slate, Eric Posner offers another option: President Obama can just raise the debt ceiling himself. After all, as Krugman notes, Congress is giving Obama two different instructions. It's the president's responsibility to choose which one to follow. Then there's the argument that the 14th Amendment  says that the debt of the United States will always be paid,  an argument that the Huffington Post notes Nancy Pelosi likes.

When they arrived on the scene around 11:30am, one of the hottest parts of the day (KESQ notes it was around 94 degrees; the New York Daily News says temps hit 104 on Wednesday), they found two boys, ages 6 and 5, and their 7-year-old sister all alone without shoes or anything to drink, the Desert Sun reports. Even more disturbing: Their mom and her boyfriend allegedly left them there as a form of punishment. The children had endured the desert heat for about 45 minutes by the time they were found. Mary Bell, 34, and Gary Cassle, 29, who were said to be living in their car just down the road from where the kids were discovered, were arrested and charged on suspicion of felony child abuse.

The Lake County Office of Emergency Management says seven skiers on Star Mountain near Independence Pass triggered the slide at about 5pm yesterday. Three were hospitalized with injuries that included a broken leg, a broken ankle, and a possible broken rib and collapsed lung. The Lake County Sheriff's Office says search and rescue crews found the bodies of two skiers this afternoon. The avalanche happened near Leadville, which is about 80 miles southwest of Denver.

"(Sep 28, 2015  7:38 AM CDT) For a fifth time in six years, Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki is turning back from his summit bid on Mount Everest—this time hindered by heavy autumn snows and the profound challenge of making the bid with only his right thumb. Kuriki, 33, lost nine fingers to frostbite on the mountain in 2012, when he barely survived two days in a snow hole at 27,000 feet in below-zero temps, reports the BBC. And with the mountain claiming one in 10 climbers who try to summit, Kuriki decided not to push his luck. This time it was the conditions that prompted him to turn back after spending a month acclimatizing, reports CNN.  I realized if I kept going, I wouldn't be able to come back alive,  Kuriki wrote on Facebook. Kuriki was at the final stretch, having rested at the last camp on the route that Everest's first climbers, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, took in 1953, but  it took too much time to move in deep deep snow,  he wrote. Kuriki was not only climbing without oxygen, but also without partners—he prefers to climb solo—and at a difficult, more volatile time of year. Climbers typically make their attempts in May, but Nepal closed the mountain for the spring climbing season after the April earthquake killed 19 people at base camp.

A few hours later, a suicide attack hit Shiite pilgrims heading to the holy Shiite city of Karbala, killing 45; those explosions took place about 200 miles southeast of Baghdad. Though a military spokesperson says it is too early to say who was behind the attacks, coordinated bombings, particularly those targeting Shiite areas, are the hallmark of Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda.

The increase itself, however, is one of the lower hikes in years, a slowdown caused by the economic crisis in many Western nations. US military spending rose 2.8%, reaching $698 billion, a significant climb, but well below 2009's increase of 7.7%. All told, US military spending has soared 81% since 2001, and now accounts for 4.8% of America's GDP. In contrast, spending in Europe fell 2.8% to $382 billion.  In many cases, the falls or slower increases represent a delayed reaction to the global financial and economic crisis that broke in 2008,  wrote the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in a statement.

According to Gizmodo, 195 countries signed a climate pact on Saturday to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. In two decades of climate conferences, this is the first to end in a successful agreement.  Our text is the best possible balance, a balance which is powerful yet delicate, which will enable each delegation, each group of countries, with his head held high, having achieved something important,  French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says. After the pact—the first to legally commit all countries to reducing carbon emissions—was signed, delegates from the 195 countries rose for a standing ovation, the BBC reports. The final agreement represents a compromise between developed and developing countries. Gizmodo reports it calls for nations to keep global warming  well below  2 degrees Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as a target. Countries  already feeling the impacts of climate change  had pushed for the lower limit. Developed countries will commit $100 billion per year to help developing countries, though that commitment isn't legally binding. According to the BBC, nations will have to report on their progress every five years. Gizmodo notes the most optimistic portion of the final agreement is a section calling for net zero carbon emissions sometime in the second half of the 21st century.

The city council has approved raising it to $15 an hour by 2020, reports the Los Angeles Times. Under the plan, the rate will rise from $9 to $10.50 in July 2016, then tick up annually to $12, $13.25, $14.25, and $15. Businesses with 25 or fewer workers will get an extra year to phase it in. Though a handful of other cities have voted for a $15 rate, including Seattle, Los Angeles is the biggest city to do so. The move doesn't become official until the city attorney's office drafts an ordinance and sends it back to council members for their approval, but once it does, it's going to affect a lot of people, notes the New York Times. The newspaper cites one study showing that about 40% of workers in the city make less than $15 an hour. The city's chamber of commerce predicts layoffs as a result.  It's simple math,  says one official.  There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time.

Time reports a 46-year-old woman just placed a $615,862 bet on Clinton to win the election. British bookmaker William Hill says it's the biggest bet ever placed on a US presidential election. William Hill is currently giving 4/11 odds on a Clinton victory, meaning the unidentified bettor stands to make a $224,000. But Elite Daily worries the history-making bet may have majorly jinxed Clinton.

Three hours later, Ora Lee Rodriquez was dead, too. It's like something out of The Notebook, daughter Corina Martinez tells Fox 29.  I just can't believe something like this would ever happen,  she says. They were  in their hospital beds, right beside each other. They were holding hands.  The pair—who met while George was working at a San Antonio butcher shop—married on June 1, 1958, and raised three daughters. And though both suffered from dementia in later life, they never left the family home, where they both died. Georgia Perez says her mom even predicted that the couple would die together. It was their way with everything.  It did happen,  she says.  We didn't think it would, but it did.

"(Sep 24, 2013  3:09 AM CDT) A breakthrough in a case that has baffled South Dakota police for 42 years: The car that two girls missing since 1971 were last seen in has been found in a creek, the Argus Leader reports. Pam Jackson and Sherri Miller, both 17, were in the 1960 Studebaker Lark when they disappeared on their way to a party. A fisherman who remembered the case called the police when he spotted the overturned car in the creek, exposed by record low water levels. Officials have declined to comment on whether any remains were found in the car, which was too damaged to be removed from the creek without destroying potential evidence. A man serving time for an unrelated crime was indicted in 2007 for murder, rape, and kidnapping in the girls' deaths, but the charges were dismissed after prosecutors found that a confession allegedly made to a fellow inmate was faked. Jackson's three siblings learned of the breakthrough just three days after they buried their father, Oscar, who died last week at the age of 102.  It’s like when Oscar got to heaven, he told them to reveal the information  on what happened to Pam, her brother-in-law says.

In a New York City raid, at least 70 NYPD officers accompanied by state troopers raided a basement cockfighting operation as spectators cheered a bloody fight, the New York Times reports. Scores of spectators were briefly detained and animal rescue officials took the birds, many of which were hanging in sacks on the walls, to safety. Investigators also raided a Brooklyn pet store and a farm upstate, where thousands of birds raised and trained for fighting were rescued. The farm is believed to have supplied birds to fighting rings in several states, reports the AP.

"(Jul 20, 2017  1:08 PM CDT) A new study puts a number on the amount of plastic the planet has manufactured in the roughly 65 years we've been cranking it out: 9 billion tons. If you're struggling to visualize that weight, the BBC helps out: That's as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings or 1 billion elephants. The researchers behind it—who hail from the University of California-Santa Barbara, the University of Georgia, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, reports CNBC—call theirs  the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured.  Their paper, published in Science Advances, is replete with numbers: For instance, some 4.3 billion of the tons, or nearly half, were produced in the last 13 years alone. In 2014, 24% of plastic waste was incinerated and 18% recycled. But the long view isn't pretty: When looking at all plastics made through 2015, only 12% had been burned and 9% recycled, meaning 79% of plastic waste was left sitting in landfills or other locations (like in our oceans). The US recycling rate, meanwhile, is behind that of Europe (30%) and even China (25%). In the case of packaging, the  end of [plastics'] useful lifetimes  comes in less than a year; for building and construction, it's decades. The researchers' somewhat gloomy assessment:  Without a well-designed and tailor-made management strategy for end-of-life plastics, humans are conducting a singular uncontrolled experiment on a global scale, in which billions of metric tons of material will accumulate across all major terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the planet.

"(Dec 21, 2009  8:00 AM) Taxpayers are doling out more than $40,000 a month to pay for Dennis Hastert’s office, staff, cell phone, SUV, and satellite TV subscriptions—even though the ex-speaker of the House now works as a lobbyist. It’s a troubling situation, ethics experts tell Politico, because though the law provides all those perks for five years after a speaker leaves office, it also prohibits federal money from paying for lobbying operations. In other words, Hastert can have the perks legally, as long as he doesn’t use any of them for his lobbying work.  That all needs to be above board, in the clear and transparent,  says one government watchdog,  And it’s not.

"(Jun 14, 2017  4:00 AM CDT) Rolling Stone magazine has agreed to pay $1.65 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a University of Virginia fraternity over a debunked story about a gang-rape, the fraternity said Tuesday. The settlement closes the final chapter of a lengthy legal saga sparked by the 2014 story  A Rape on Campus,  which was retracted after a police investigation found no evidence to back up the harrowing account of the woman identified in the story only as  Jackie,  the AP reports. The Virginia Alpha Chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which had sought $25 million, said in a statement that its members are glad to be able to put the  ordeal  behind them.  It has been nearly three years since we, and the entire University of Virginia community, were shocked by the now infamous article, and we are pleased to be able to close the book on that trying ordeal and its aftermath,  the fraternity said. The case had been scheduled to go to trial in October. The lawsuit claimed that the magazine knew that Jackie was not a reliable source and ignored red flags indicating that her story was flawed. The fraternity said it plans to donate  a significant portion  of the settlement to groups that provide sexual assault awareness education, prevention training, and victim counseling services.

"(Mar 10, 2016  1:29 AM) A gun-rights advocate in Florida was hospitalized on Tuesday after apparently flouting gun, vehicle, and child safety rules. Police say 31-year-old Jamie Gilt was accidentally shot by her 4-year-old son while driving down a road in Putnam County, reports the Chicago Tribune. The boy had apparently found a loaded .45-caliber handgun on the floor of her pickup.  She was shot through the seat and the round went through her back,  a police spokesman tells the Florida Times-Union.  There was a booster seat in the back of the vehicle, but ... the boy was not strapped in when the deputy got to them,  he says. Gilt was rushed to the hospital and the boy was turned over to family members. Gilt has had a strong pro-gun presence on social media, including the now offline  Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense  Facebook page, where just hours before the shooting she boasted that her 4-year-old  gets jacked up to target shoot.  In a press release, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office says it has been unable to interview Gilt because of her injuries. The office says the gun was legally owned, but it is a  misdemeanor for a person to store or leave, on a premise under his or her control, a loaded firearm in such a manner that it is likely a child can gain access to the firearm.  Police are investigating and the Florida Department of Children and Families has also been notified.","Pro-Gun Mom Shot by Son, 4","Pro-Gun Mom Shot by Son, ____",4,Copy( 4 ),0

Michael Morones is  the kid that never walks. He dances everywhere,  his mom tells ABC 11. But on the evening of Jan. 23, overcome with the teasing,  he hung himself off the side of the bunk bed, off the railing,  she says. His parents rushed him to the hospital, but because oxygen to his brain was cut off, he may suffer life-long brain damage. Chicago Now reports his brain, heart, and lungs were damaged. And even now, the family is still being bullied; they say they've received negative comments online. But they don't want the kids who bullied Michael punished:  I don't think that's what Mike would want. I would rather teach people how to do right,  says his mom. Stepdad Shannon Suttle adds that the cartoon itself is all about friendship, and says,  It teaches the most basic moral values.  But there have been acts of kindness: Suttle called the actress who voices Michael's favorite character, Pinkie Pie, requesting that she record a message for him. She did, and got the entire cast to do the same.  When we play the My Little Pony messages for him, there is increased activity on the EEG,  Suttle says.

It's an increasingly  farcical  situation that shows the impossibility of controlling information in the Information Age, reports the Independent. Things started to heat up on Saturday when a law firm representing the player announced that  an application has been made to obtain limited information concerning the unlawful use of Twitter by a small number of individuals who may have breached a court order,  after a journalist reportedly tweeted the player's name.
