"(Oct 4, 2017  9:47 AM CDT) Despite its very public failure to protect the data of about 150 million Americans, Equifax has landed a fat government deal to prevent fraud. Under the $7.25 million no-bid contract signed last month, the embattled credit bureau will provide the IRS with taxpayer and personal identity verification services, Politico reports. The agency says Equifax alone is qualified for the job, despite the company's role in one of the worst data breaches ever. The IRS defended the move to stick with Equifax, saying it has an existing contract for similar services with the company and does not believe Equifax poses a risk to IRS data. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, one of at least two lawmakers who wrote the IRS protesting the deal, said that,  I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true.  As news of the deal triggered incredulity on Twitter, the company's embattled ex-CEO told a bipartisan House panel on Tuesday he was sorry hackers got their hands on so much private information, per the New York Times. Richard F. Smith blamed a sole employee for flouting security warnings and failing to perform necessary software updates to keep billions of records safe. (An Equifax rep wouldn't tell the Times if the worker was still employed.) Smith, who resigned last week, downplayed the crisis, but lawmakers weren't having it.  How does this happen?  asked GOP Rep. Greg Walden.  I don’t think we can pass a law that … fixes stupid.

"(Sep 4, 2015  10:39 AM CDT) 7-Eleven has announced it will begin delivery service in five US cities in an effort to  redefine convenience,  as one executive puts it in L.A. Biz. So what does redefined convenience look like? The Chicago Tribune reports that for $20, 7-Eleven and new partner DoorDash will bring you a  Date Night Pack,  which includes chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, a chocolate bar, a Red Bull, gum, and condoms. Should your date night not involve pajamas and Netflix, there's also a $15  Hangover Pack  with a pain reliever, Gatorade, a pepperoni pizza, and a turkey sandwich. 7-Eleven delivery is available now in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago and will be available soon in Boston and Washington DC, the Tribune reports. According to L.A. Biz, more than 200 7-Eleven stores are participating, and DoorDash will charge a $2.99 delivery fee to start. But that will go up in the near future. But 7-Eleven's famous Slurpees are not on the delivery menu, as DoorDash hasn't figured out how to deliver them before they melt.

"(Jul 24, 2014  8:56 AM CDT) Gaza health officials say the death toll from an Israeli strike on a compound housing a UN school in the northern Gaza Strip has risen to at least 15. Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra says the 15 were among hundreds of people seeking shelter in the school in Beit Hanoun from heavy fighting in the area. At least 150 people were injured; al-Jazeera puts that number at 200. Sources tell al-Jazeera the number killed could be as high as 30. Today's strike is the fourth time a UN facility has been hit in fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, but it's the first time casualties have been reported.","Israeli Strike Hits UN School, Kills 15"
"(Jun 21, 2018  1:10 PM CDT) Immigrant children as young as 14 housed at a juvenile detention center in Virginia say they were beaten while handcuffed and left nude and shivering for long periods in solitary confinement. The abuse claims against the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center near Staunton are detailed in a federal lawsuit that includes a half-dozen sworn statements from Latino teens jailed there for months or years, reports the AP. Multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads. One Mexican youth says he was strapped to a chair  for two and a half days, including at night.  Another says he afterwards tried to kill himself and was punished further. A former child-development specialist who worked at the center tells the AP she saw kids with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards. Many of the children who crossed the southern border alone were sent there after immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs, including MS-13. But a top manager at the center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home countries—problems the detention facility is ill-equipped to treat. Since 2007, about half the 58 beds are occupied by both male and female immigrants between the ages of 12 and 17 facing deportation proceedings or awaiting rulings on asylum claims. In addition to subjecting such immigrants to beatings, mostly white guards are accused of taunting the children with racially charged epithets. In court filings, lawyers for the detention facility have denied all allegations of physical abuse. More details here.",Child Immigrant: I Was Strapped to Chair for 60 Hours

"(Mar 17, 2012  1:48 PM CDT) John Edwards owes the US Treasury a couple million dollars, and he has just 30 days to pay it. The Federal Election Commission announced yesterday that Edwards received $2.1 million too much in matching funds from the Treasury during his 2008 Democratic nomination campaign, MSNBC reports. The commission dismissed arguments from Edwards' lawyers, who claimed the commission was wrong in saying he had received more money than he should have, the AP reports. His matching funds total for 2008: $12.8 million. But while Team Edwards  disagrees with the commission's determination, it will not pursue this matter further,  said an Edwards lawyer. One interesting tidbit: Edwards' campaign is still spending money despite having ended more than four years ago. Hotel rooms, air fares, and other bills cost the campaign $836,712 last year. Note that this ruling is separate from his pending criminal case, in which Edwards has pleaded not guilty to breaking campaign finance laws while hiding his affair with Rielle Hunter.

Grace Mugabe was due to appear in court Tuesday afternoon, local news outlet eNCA reported. The 52-year-old is  not under arrest because she cooperated and handed herself over,  Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula said in a video posted on eNCA. Gabriella Engels, 20, has accused Mugabe of assaulting her while she was visiting Mugabe's sons in a hotel room. She claims the first lady's bodyguards stood by and watched as Mugabe attacked her. Engels posted several photos on social media showing a gash in her forehead, which she calls a result of the alleged encounter, reports the AP. Engels told News24 she had no idea who Mugabe was when she walked into the room  with an extension cord and just started beating me with it. ... She flipped and just kept beating me with the plug.  Engels claims the first lady accused her of living with her sons.  The investigation into this case has already reached an advanced stage,  a police statement on Tuesday said.

"(Oct 14, 2013  10:16 AM CDT) A pretty incredible tale of survival out of northern California, where a deer hunter lost in the Mendocino National Forest survived for 19 days. The most incredible parts: temperatures fell as low as 25 degrees; Gene Penaflor was at one point temporarily unconscious after falling down a steep slope; he's also 72 years old. Penaflor had set out with a fellow hunter on Sept. 24. They used what CNN terms a  common hunting strategy  where you split up to track an animal on two sides; Penaflor was a no-show at their meet-up lunch spot. Two days later, a search party set out, but after four days, it was scuttled by a storm. Though they set out again, it was a hunter who heard the man's calls for help and phoned authorities. Penaflor was roughly three miles from where he went missing, notes NBC Bay Area. The hunter and his group sprang to action, making a rough stretcher from tree branches and their coats. They were able to carry Penaflor for several hours to rescuers and a helicopter. He recounts how he survived—eating lizards, frogs, and squirrels; foraging for algae; using a garbage bag and packing grass and dead leaves around him to stay warm, reports KGO. His family, of course, is thrilled to have him home. Says son Jeremy,  He's good. He's hanging in there.

Police also closed off a street near Trafalgar Square to traffic and a gathering crowd. At one point the man stood on the head of the statue—of Prince George, the first Duke of Cambridge—and then sat on George's head. He finally came down after about three hours and was taken away by police under the Mental Health Act, the BBC reports.  I just laughed,  said a woman visiting from the US.  It's an experience.  But the owner of a pub complained that business owners lost money when police cordoned off the road; he also wondered why  one naked man  required eight police cars, two fire trucks, and four mounted police.

"(Oct 27, 2015  5:44 PM CDT) How cool does a helmet have to be before you can justify spending $400,000 on one? That's the question before the Pentagon, which is expected to spend around $1 billion on helmets for its new fleet of state-of-the-art F-35s, the Air Force Times reports. In fairness to the Pentagon, the new helmet—which costs four times as much as any other helmet—is pretty cool. Six cameras on the outside of the plane project images onto the pilot's visor, giving him or her a 360-degree view, including through the bottom of the plane. The helmets also have built-in night vision and display speed, targets, altitude, and more on the visors.  The helmet is much more than a helmet,  Air Force Chief of Staff Mark Welsh says.  Calling this thing a helmet...we've got to come up with a new word.  But Dan Grazier with the Project on Government Oversight tells the Times he thinks the helmets are an overcomplicated solution to simple problems. Each helmet is built to the specifications of individual pilots, which means no sharing helmets or reusing them. The Washington Post reports pilots lighter than 136 pounds are currently prohibited from flying the F-35s because they could suffer potentially fatal whiplash while ejecting with the heavy helmet on their heads. In addition, images from the helmet's cameras are jittery during turbulence, and a green glow from the night vision is hurting pilots' vision. Experts aren't sure these will be simple fixes.  I never want to say anything’s easy in the F-35 program, because nothing is ever easy,  Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan tells the Post.",F-35's Fancy New Helmets Come With Wild Price Tag

"(Jul 23, 2019  3:03 AM CDT) Two Louisiana police officers have been fired over a Facebook post that appeared to threaten Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—one for posting it, and the other for liking it. Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson said Charlie Rispolo and Angelo Varisco were fired for violating the department's social media policy, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. Rispoli had shared a fake news story about the Democrat thinking soldiers are paid too much, calling her a  vile idiot  and saying she  needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve.  Rispoli is a 14-year veteran of the force and Varisco, who liked the post, joined the force in 2016.  This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department,  the chief told reporters Monday.  These officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting US congressman, a member of our government. We're not going to tolerate that.  The chief described Rispoli as remorseful and expressed puzzlement that the officer had reacted so strongly to a satirical news story, the New York Times reports.  I think he just got caught up in the heat of the moment,  the chief said.  And this wasn’t even a real news article.

"(Sep 11, 2011  4:00 PM CDT) Ten years later, and still no great 9/11 novels? Yes, because  at its heart, 9/11 was meaningless,  writes Laura Miller at Salon.  I realize that sounds inflammatory, but hear me out.  A novelist explores  the winding and unwinding of long strands of cause and effect, in the reasons people do things and the often unanticipated results they get.  And it's hard to infuse that into the 2,996 deaths of 9/11. Those deaths were simply  abrupt and unanticipated, as is the case with most disasters.  Miller admits that police and firefighters  are the great exception  because they sacrificed their lives on 9/11—yet a firefighter who dies in any fire  is no less brave or heroic.  Some novelists have tried to find meaning in 9/11 deaths anyway, but Miller considers their efforts sentimental or self-aggrandizing. She prefers less literal books, like James Hyne's Next, about a self-absorbed man about to die in a 9/11-like attack. Yet the novel never reaches his demise, because there is  next to nothing, perhaps nothing at all,  to say about death itself.  Silence, too, can be eloquent.",9/11 Too 'Meaningless' to Inspire Great Novels
"(Oct 18, 2019  7:55 AM CDT) The man accused of the brutal strangling of a woman in an Alaska hotel room last month killed another woman, police say. Brian Steven Smith, 48, was charged with murder, sexual assault, and evidence tampering based on footage from an SD card labeled  homicide at midtown Marriott,  found on an Anchorage street. Police say the footage from the first week of September showed Smith beating and choking an Alaska Native woman, 30-year-old Kathleen Jo Henry, whose body was found near the Seward Highway on Oct. 2. The 2nd alleged murder was revealed as Smith was questioned following his arrest at Anchorage International Airport on Oct. 8, detectives announced Thursday, per the Anchorage Daily News. They say Smith admitted to fatally shooting Veronica Abouchuk, 52, and detailed the location of her body. Last seen in July 2018, Abouchuk was reported missing in February, two months before her remains—including a skull with a gunshot wound—were found along Old Glenn Highway. Authorities didn't rule out the possibility of more victims at a Thursday press conference, nor did they offer a motive for Smith's actions. CNN reports the Anchorage resident, who became a naturalized US citizen last month, is to be arraigned on new charges of murder and evidence tampering on Monday. Fearing he could flee to his native South Africa, prosecutors have requested Smith's bail be raised from $750,000 to $2 million. They say the killer poses a public safety risk, especially to  vulnerable, homeless women,  per KTVA; Abouchuk was reportedly homeless. (More on the case here.)","The SD Card Showed a Murder.

Dixie Stevenson explains why to the CBC: Her late father, Capt. Dick Stevenson, would like his digits used in the bar drink he invented. The New York Daily News reports that the elder Stevenson, who came up with the  Sourtoe Cocktail  that has  delighted and disgusted  customers at the Downtown Hotel in Yukon, Canada, for nearly five decades, has died at the age of 89. The former riverboat captain came up with the idea for his signature libation—an alcohol-based drink that has a mummified human toe floating in it—in 1973, when he and some friends found a preserved toe in an abandoned cabin and inexplicably decided to add it to a boozy beverage. Stevenson and his crew also came up with the Sourtoe drinking ritual that made its way to the Downtown and has attracted brave imbibers ever since. To join the  club,  the person downing the cocktail has to make sure their lips actually touch the floating toe. People have donated replacement toes over the years, including an ex-British commando, and in 2017, one of the toes was even stolen. But just as intense as the drink was the man behind it. His daughter tells the CBC that in his youth, Stevenson hitchhiked across Canada and worked on cattle ranches, in logging and mining camps, and as a fish warden before becoming a boat captain.

"(Sep 22, 2020  8:11 AM CDT) A week after the NFL warned its coaches and teams about following proper safety protocols regarding COVID-19, the league has now handed down more than $1 million in fines, including to three head coaches. Sources tell ESPN that Vic Fangio of the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll, and Kyle Shanahan of the San Francisco 49ers each got hit with a $100,000 fine for not wearing face masks covering their noses and mouths on the sidelines; Yahoo Sports has a picture. Those three teams also each got slammed with an additional $250,000 fine. Players aren't subject to the face covering rule, but all other nonplayers on the sidelines in the  bench area  (the part of the sideline between the 30-yard lines) are, according to a memo sent last week by NFL exec Troy Vincent, per CBS Sports. ESPN notes there'd been a  wide variance in compliance  during the first Sunday of games, which led to Vincent's memo. Carroll, Fangio, and Shanahan were seen at various points in this past Sunday's games with their face coverings around their necks. Other coaches—including Sean Payton of the New Orleans Saints, and the Las Vegas Raiders' Jon Gruden, who's already had COVID-19—may also be fined, based on documentation of their own mask flouting.  We must remain vigilant and disciplined in following the processes and protocols put in place by not only the league, union, and clubs, but also by state and local governments,  Vincent said in his memo.

The 15-year-old New York City girl started Nannies by Noa in August 2012, and the New York Post figures a  conservative estimate  of $375,000 in revenue (without specifying a timeframe). CNN Money notes that as an 8th-grader, Noa was devoting 40 hours a week to her company. And so in July she hired a CEO to ease her  excruciating hours  dealing with  hundreds of emails  per day, she explains to the Post. That CEO, 26-year-old Allison Johnson, says that while  it was a little bit of a challenge at first  taking directions from a then-14-year-old, she's impressed with Noa's work ethic.  She'll get back to me during study hall. She can't shut off.  Nannies by Noa, which matches up families with babysitters and full-time nannies, was hatched when Noa, then a 6th-grader, realized she was always unhappy with her own caregivers and figured there had to be a better way.  For what you’re paying, your kids should be more stimulated,  she says, explaining that her company works with  engaged nannies who don't sit on the side at the playgrounds on their phones.  Those nannies go through an intense interview process—one 37-year-old tells the Post she had no idea she was being interviewed by a teen, and  was intimidated.  Today, the company has 190 clients; they pay a fee of $5 per hour for babysitters or 15% of a nanny's gross salary (typically $50,000 to $80,000). Noa did need some help: Her dad is the registered owner of the business, and filed the LLC on her behalf since she's a minor.

The violence, which struck at least 10 cities across the nation, highlighted militant attempts to sow havoc in the country and undermine the government. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, although security forces are a frequent target of al-Qaeda's Iraqi franchise, which has vowed to reassert itself and take back areas it was forced from before US troops withdrew from the country last year. In the day's deadliest attack, gunmen stormed a small Iraqi Army outpost in the town of Dujail before dawn, killing at least 10 soldiers and wounding eight more, according to police and hospital officials in the nearby city of Balad, some 50 miles north of Baghdad. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information. Hours later, a car bomb struck a group of police recruits waiting in line to apply for jobs with the state-run Northern Oil Co. outside the northern city of Kirkuk.

But preliminary is a key word, because the airline will surely be shelling out much, much more. For starters, a world treaty requires airlines to pay families up to about $157,000 each after the crash of an international flight, no matter what caused it, reports AP. But in this case, given that investigators think the co-pilot crashed it intentionally after hiding his mental health problems, the airline is on the hook for  unlimited financial damage,  says one aviation lawyer. Another expert in the field quoted by Bloomberg agrees.  The liability for the victims would be uncapped,  he says.  From the perspective of the airline it’s difficult. There are no real defenses that you can use. It is irrational. That is why you buy insurance.  In fact, the airline's insurance should cover it even if investigators definitively conclude that pilot Andreas Lubitz committed suicide and took passengers along with him, says a lawyer from London's Stewarts Law LLP.

But what he did not tell those using his clinic was that he was the clinic's major donor, likely making some 20 donations a year. The clinic's records were destroyed by his wife years ago, but preliminary DNA testing of 18 people conceived at the clinic indicates up to 600 babies could have been fathered by Wiesner over the years, reports the Telegraph. In the UK, the 1990 Human Fertilization and Embryology Act limits to 10 the number of families one person can donate eggs or sperm to. Two of the men who were fathered by Wiesner at the clinic have led the charge to uncover the truth of the clinic.

"(Sep 3, 2015  8:05 AM CDT) Congratulations, environmentalists, tree-huggers, and people who enjoy breathing oxygen: the Earth has seven times more trees—approximately 3 trillion—than previously estimated, according to a new study in Nature. Scientists from around the world created the first  data-driven global tree census  by combining satellite images with tree counts from around the world, coming up with an estimate that amounts to about 422 trees per person, Gizmodo reports. The most tree-dense forests (nearly 25% of all trees) were in North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, while the most trees (more than 40%) were found in tropical and subtropical forests, notes Nature. Now here's why the grand total, though bigger than expected, isn't necessarily a cause for celebration. The study shows that approximately 15 billion trees are lost every year, and there are only about half as many trees as there were when humans first started farming 12,000 years ago.  The scale of human impact is astonishing,  Thomas Crowther, one of the researchers behind the count, says in Nature.  We're not saying, 'Oh, everything's fine.'  Gizmodo points out that trees are integral to providing the Earth with clean water and good soil while lessening the impact of carbon emissions.

That more than twice as many Nazis as originally reported by the AP last October, underscoring what the New York Times calls  the ease with which thousands of former Nazis managed to settle into new lives in the United States with little scrutiny.  Among the report's specifics:  It is outrageous that any Nazis were able to receive benefits, but this report also makes clear that the Social Security Administration lacked the legal right to terminate benefits in far too many of these cases,  says Rep.

"(Sep 18, 2015  6:24 PM CDT) The co-creator of South Park is helping save a trio of sequoias under threat from development in Portland, Oregon, which means  Lorax Dave  the protester might finally be able to come down, KATU reports. According to the Oregonian, the trees were planted in the mid-1800s, but developer Everett Custom Homes wanted to remove them to build two houses. Neighbors reached an agreement with the developer to buy the land for $900,000 in June but failed to actually pay the money. The president of the neighborhood association tells the Oregonian they didn't realize how hard raising nearly $1 million would be. Fortunately for the trees and Lorax Dave, a new deal—for an undisclosed sum—was reached yesterday. KATU reports neighbors once again agreed to buy the property—reportedly for much less than $900,000 this time—with the help of an anonymous second developer, who plans on keeping the trees, and what KOIN calls a  substantial gift  from South Park co-creator Matt Stone. But the trees aren't out of the woods yet. Just as the deal was being finalized, a crew from Everett Custom Homes showed up to cut the trees down, forcing neighbors to form a human blockade, KATU reports.  This is absolutely ridiculous that he would send these people here,  neighbor Arthur Bradford, who works with Stone, tells KATU.  This is unbelievable. We should not have men with chainsaws on our street around our homes.  Needless to say, Lorax Dave plans to stay in his perch until he's certain the trees are safe.",South Park  Co-Creator Helps Save 3 Sequoias

One day after that family sued and won the right to have the 10-year-old placed on the adult waiting list, a second family has done the same, reports NBC News. The second family also was successful, convincing a federal judge to allow the 11-year-old to get on the adult list, reports AP. Under the current system both families are challenging, patients younger than 12 are supposed to use a pediatric waiting list, but it has far fewer organs available.  Javier is severely ill and if he does not receive a donated set of lungs very soon he will die,  says the court filing by the boy's mother, Milagros Martinez.  Without one he will most likely die before his 12th birthday in August.  Javier Acosta, like the child in the first suit, has cystic fibrosis—and his older brother died of the same disease in 2009.

Even so, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, the lowest level since 1969. Florence struck North and South Carolina and closed thousands of businesses. As a result, a jobs category that includes restaurants, hotels, and casinos lost ground for the first time since last September, when Hurricane Harvey had a similar effect. Average hourly pay increased just 2.8% from a year earlier in September, reports the AP, one tick below the yearly gain in August.

"(Mar 3, 2017  1:00 PM) Love never fails, and now researchers say they've discovered a burial ritual ostensibly designed to allow a couple's love to persist forever. Reporting in the journal PLOS One, they say that French noblewoman Louise de Quengo, who died at the age of 65 in 1656, was buried in France with her husband's actual heart atop her coffin, the organ placed in a heart-shaped lead urn. Toussaint de Perrien had been buried 125 miles away seven years earlier. The ritual, perhaps designed to allow  couples to be reunited in death,  is a  phenomenon that had until now not been noted.  Louise de Quengo's heart was also missing from her body, but neither it nor her husband's burial site have been located. National Geographic explains that while it wasn't unheard of for French aristocrats to have specific body parts buried in separate locations out of political or religious concerns, there's no record of this being done with a romantic intention. Researchers discovered de Quengo while studying bodies from a convent in Rennes in Brittany that had been the premier burial spot for the city's elite, reports Live Science. As part of the team's analysis of 133 bodies from the 14th and 15th centuries and 483 from the 1500s and 1600s, they found three other lead urns holding hearts; these were buried in the church choir. The researchers speculate that they were hidden there so as not to be seized during the French Revolution and refashioned into bullets. De Quengo's body was reburied at a family castle; her husband's heart sits in a lab freezer.

Owner Jolie Alony tells Gothamist that she wants to  bring awareness on how it feels to be a woman, so the men actually get to feel it,  by which she is referring to the fact that women pay roughly 7% more for personal products marketed to women than they would for the equivalent product marketed to men, as a recent NYC Department of Consumer Affairs report found. The 7% difference is often called the  pink tax  or  tampon tax,  and the Daily Dot reports that there's more: Women's clothes cost more to dry clean, for example, and in many states menstrual products are actually taxed as luxury goods. On Monday, Alony posted two signs out front:  All female customers shop tax free  and  All male customers are subject to a 7% man tax.  It's a bit misleading, as Time reports, given pricing didn't change at all for men but was dropped 7% for women (Alony must still pay sales tax in full, so she's paying the difference out of pocket). She wasn't sure whether she would continue the promotion past Monday. And while she said that at the shop her female customers were  very, very happy  and the men  just laughed,  the story's gone viral and the pharmacy's Facebook page is riddled with one-star reviews and comments decrying the store's  sexist and hateful business practices  and calling the owners  idiots.

The captives, fishermen from Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia, China, and the Philippines, were freed Saturday with the help of the Hostage Support Partners group, which negotiated with tribal and religious leaders.

Unless, of course, that intrepid photographer is a teenager taking a selfie and he breaks a centuries-old statue in the process. That's what happened in Milan this week when, according to witnesses, a foreign student jumped into the lap of a statue at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts, only to have the leg break under him, the Local reports. The  Drunken Satyr  statue was only a replica of an ancient Greek original, but it still dates back to the 19th century.  We think this is an accident,  said the museum's director, according to RT, which nonetheless describes the museum as  indignant.  There was no CCTV footage of the incident, making it unlikely the perpetrator will be caught—unless, of course, he posts that selfie.",Student Breaks 19th-Century Statue While Taking Selfie
"(Aug 8, 2012  4:01 AM CDT) House prices had their biggest jump in years in the second quarter of 2012, mainly because of a big shortage of houses for sale, reports the Wall Street Journal. Officials from data firm CoreLogic say it was the biggest jump since 2005, while Freddie Mac, using different methodology, says the 4.8% quarter-on-quarter rise was the biggest since 2004. The number of homes for sale is down sharply from a year ago, largely because of investors snapping up cheap homes to turn into rentals, while the lowest mortgage rates in 60 years have fueled a surge in demand. The long slowdown in new home construction has added to the home shortage, as has the fact that more than 11 million homeowners are  underwater,  owing the bank more than their homes are worth. In these conditions,  only a little bit of the market is tradable because you have so much negative equity,  the chief economist at real-estate firm Zillow says.  You have very few people willing to sell homes, and a big uptick in demand can create some real price appreciation.  But if investors keep on buying distressed homes, some analysts believe that will build momentum that will bring in more ordinary buyers and sellers.",Home Prices See Biggest Jump Since 2005

Besse Cooper died peacefully at the age of 116 yesterday, not long after she had her hair done and watched a Christmas video in the nursing home where she had lived since 2001, the AP reports. When asked about her secret to a long life by the Guinness Book of Records earlier this year, Cooper said,  I mind my own business. And I don't eat junk food.  Cooper, who was born in Tennessee but moved to Georgia to find work during World War I, was part of the suffrage movement before women gained the right to vote in 1920, CNN reports. After the 19th Amendment was passed, Cooper voted in all but two presidential elections: this year's and 1948, when she and her husband believed Thomas Dewey was sure to win. Her son says her mind was sharp and she remained in  amazing  health until the very end, and she looked back at her 80s as the best years of her life.

Galicia says he lost 26 pounds before he was released last week. Along with 60 other men, Galicia said, he was packed into a holding area, where they slept on the floor with only aluminum-foil blankets for bedding, he told the Dallas Morning News. Some slept on the bathroom floor. Galicia said he wasn't allowed to shower during his 23 days in captivity. Some detainees were ill, he said, but didn't ask to see a doctor because agents told them their cases would start over if they did.  It was inhumane how they treated us,  Galicia said, adding,  I just needed to get out of there.  Galicia was taken into custody on his way to a soccer scouting event in Texas with his brother and friends, though he had documents showing that he's a US citizen. He spent time in the custody of Customs and Border Protection, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  They wanted to psychologically intimidate him to the point he’d sign his own deportation order,  his mother, Sanjuana Galicia, told the Guardian.  We’re suing over the abuse my son endured.

"(Aug 29, 2018  4:03 AM CDT) Bayer may want to pop one of its namesake aspirins. In addition to facing some 8,000 lawsuits (at last count) claiming that glyphosate herbicides produced by Monsanto—a company that the drugmaker bought in June—cause cancer, Vietnam is now demanding compensation because of the use of another Monsanto product: the Vietnam War-era herbicide Agent Orange. The demand from Vietnam comes after a recent California verdict in the case of a former groundskeeper dying of cancer that put Monsanto on the hook for $289 million, the Independent reports. That verdict, a spokesman in Vietnam says,  refutes previous claims that the herbicides made by Monsanto and other chemical corporations in the US and provided for the US army in the war are harmless. Vietnam has suffered … lasting effects of toxic chemicals, including Agent Orange.  Some 12 million gallons of Agent Orange—so named after the orange stripe painted on the barrels that contained it— were dumped over Vietnam between 1961 and 1971 to defoliate the jungle, according to RT.com, exposing some three million people to the chemical dioxin, a toxic component of the herbicide linked to birth defects, cancer, and other health problems. Millions of Vietnamese still suffer, according to reports, and some related health problems are passed to future generations. In a statement on its website, Monsanto reiterates that it was among nine contractors to manufacture Agent Orange, adding that the government provided the recipe and determined when, where, and how it was used.",Vietnam: $289M Verdict Against Monsanto Sets Precedent

Mice given survivor antibodies managed to fight off the deadly flu when they were infected with the virus extracted from exhumed victims. The virus-killing cells, despite having kicked around in the bloodstreams of the 91- to 101-year-old survivors for nearly a century, still had enough potency to save the infected mice.

"(Dec 17, 2020  7:41 AM) Walter Forbes was in his 20s when he was sent to prison for murder. At age 63, he was told his conviction had been thrown out. It was like watching a  vision unfold,  the Michigan man tells CNN. Still,  it's pretty sad that it took 38 years,  says Forbes' lawyer, Imran Syed, of the Michigan Innocence Clinic. Forbes had been a college student when he tried to break up a fight outside a bar in 1982, per CNN. The next day, a man named Dennis Hall shot Forbes four times in retaliation. Released on bail, Hall would soon after die in a suspected arson fire at his apartment in Jackson. At the time, Forbes remembers thinking he might be framed. And that appears to be exactly what happened. A witness came forward three months after the fire to say she'd seen Forbes and two other men pouring gasoline around the building. The only one convicted, Forbes received a life sentence for arson and murder. Years later, Forbes learned the building's owner, David Jones, had pleaded no contest in an arson insurance fraud scheme, and he began to suspect  a pattern.  Unbeknownst to Forbes, authorities had already been told of an alleged confession, in which a person admitted to setting the 1982 fire for Jones, who'd recently taken out an insurance policy on the building. The Michigan Innocence Clinic helped reveal that information as it began investigating in 2010. It also spoke to the first witness, whose claim that gas was poured outside the building from red canisters didn't match evidence at the scene—the only gas canister there was blue, and accelerants were poured inside the building. The woman recanted, saying two men had threatened to kill her and her family if she didn't implicate Forbes. Both men are now dead, as is Jones. Released Nov. 20, Forbes hopes to find  the most effective way to help others,  per the Detroit Free Press.","Walter Forbes Was Framed. 38 Years Later, He's Free"

Brett Ryan, 36, was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years Friday after confessing to killing his mother and two of his three brothers, the Toronto Star reports. His father died in 2015. The court heard that days before the Aug. 25 killings, Ryan admitted to his mother that he had lost his IT job after they discovered he had spent more than three years in prison for eight bank robberies in 2008. He told her he had been lying about working from the apartment he shared with the woman he was due to marry in three weeks. Susan Ryan advised her son to tell the truth to his fiancee and promised to support him for a brief time financially—but fearing she would expose him, he returned days later with a crossbow, the CBC reports.

"(Oct 10, 2018  8:05 AM CDT) New York State gained a high-profile registered Democrat on Tuesday: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg re-registered with the party, a key move in what could be a 2020 bid for president as a Democrat. On Wednesday morning he posted a photo on Instagram of him signing the paperwork, with a caption that reads,  At key points in US history, one of the two parties has served as a bulwark against those who threaten our Constitution. Two years ago at the Democratic Convention, I warned of those threats. Today, I have re-registered as a Democrat—I had been a member for most of my life—because we need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs.  Bloomberg had been a Democrat until he changed his registration in 2001 and was elected mayor that year as a Republican. He gave up that registration six years later and had been unaffiliated with a party since. Bloomberg characterizes his move as  one of his most overt ... to date  in terms of a possible presidential run. It notes that last month he said in a New York Times interview that he believes a third-party candidate cannot win the presidency, and that were he to run, he would do so as a Democrat.

So officials and experts are pushing other ideas; Ballard's dream involves turning it into a virtual museum, allowing visitors to view it from above via cameras, USA Today reports. Exhibitions have brought up artifacts from the wreck, ranging from jewelry to letters to an 18-ton portion of the ship's hull, a process that some survivors appreciate. But the site has also become a tourist attraction, with Russian subs bringing rich looky-loos down, and that has caused a buildup of garbage near the wreck; the US Coast Guard recently asked ships to refrain from dropping trash within 10 nautical miles. What next? Ballard wants to preserve the wreck by cleaning and repainting the hull and injecting bacteria-killing preservatives, but that's an expensive prospect.","100 Years Later, How to Save the Titanic?"

Between January and March, Richard Betancourt, 22, took the $13 toll from drivers of cars but recorded them as motorcycles, which are charged only $5.50, say police. The snag: Computers monitor the axles of vehicles on the bridge, and officials eventually spotted the discrepancies.

Health officials in Ohio believe there could be almost that many unconfirmed cases in their state alone.

"(Jan 30, 2019  7:12 PM) More than a year and a half later, there are still more questions than answers in the death of Isabella Hellmann, the Miami Herald reports. The 41-year-old and her husband, Lewis Bennett, set out from their South Florida home on a sailing honeymoon, but on their way back to Florida on May 15, 2017, Hellmann disappeared and the boat sank. Bennett long denied any culpability, but in November pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in her death; her body was never found. But at a sentencing hearing Tuesday in Miami, the 41-year-old continued to insist he did not intentionally kill his wife and sink the catamaran to cover up her murder, as prosecutors initially charged him with; his sentencing was ultimately delayed until May due to unresolved issues regarding Hellmann's estate, the Miami Herald reports.  What happened that night with my girl?  Hellman's mother, in Spanish, asked the judge at Tuesday's hearing (Hellmann was a US citizen; her family is from Colombia).  He needs to say what happened,  added Hellman's sister.  She disappeared and that’s it. What happened to her?  All Bennett, who holds dual citizenship from Australia as well as his native Britain, has said is that the boat ran into trouble overnight while Hellman was on watch; a loud noise woke him up and he came above deck to find her gone. He admitted she was not a strong swimmer or sailor yet he did not require her to wear a life jacket or harness, and that he didn't do much to search for her. At Tuesday's hearing, he apologized to her family for his  poor decisions,  the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The couple's only child, a 2-year-old girl, lives with Bennett's parents in Scotland, and Hellmann's family is at odds with them over visitation rights.

"(Aug 6, 2015  1:35 AM CDT) Asking for tips on social media isn't the most reliable way to track down a fugitive, as 11 armed bounty hunters found out the hard way in Phoenix on Tuesday night. They converged on a home around 10pm only to discover, after a confrontation, that it was the residence of Police Chief Joseph Yahner, the LA Times reports. Police say that when they were called to Yahner's address, they found employees of NorthStar Fugitive Recovery and Delta One Tactical Recovery surrounding the home, with one man banging on the door with a weapon and ordering the chief to come out, the Arizona Republic reports. Police video of the incident shows the furious chief emerging in his underwear to confront the men. Brent Farley, the owner of NorthStar, was arrested on charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, reports the LA Times. The bounty hunters were seeking a drug fugitive from Oklahoma who, unlike the chief of police, is black and weighs 310 pounds. The bounty hunters followed an  unconfirmed tip,  police say, and Reuters reports that NorthStar had asked for tips earlier in the day on its Facebook page, which has apparently now been taken down.

That's according to a new report by the CDC, which says 200,000 heart disease and stroke deaths each year are preventable, the LA Times reports.  These findings are really striking. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that don't have to happen,  says the CDC's director.  It's possible for us to make rapid and substantial progress in reducing these deaths.  The good news from the report is that the number of these preventable deaths decreased by 29% between 2001 and 2010. The bad news is that was mostly for people aged 65-74—the percentage remains virtually unchanged for people under 65, who accounted for more than half of these deaths last year. Men were twice as likely to die of these causes as women, blacks almost twice as likely as whites, and victims are disproportionately likely to live in Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oklahoma (the CDC has an informative but depressing map on this).",CDC: 200K Americans Die Needlessly Each Year

They opened his obit with this line:  Ryan Douglas Bossie, 27, died January 30, 2015, in Portland after losing a hard-fought battle with addiction.  Bossie's brother, Andrew, now talks to the Bangor Daily News about the decision to do so, explaining that the first pass at the obituary didn't name Bossie's struggle with drugs.  I just said I don't think we should be ashamed of this,  recounts Andrew.  I hope that by including that maybe it helps someone else just a little bit, that their story has a different ending.  And so the family agreed to take what the paper calls  the rare step  of mentioning the addiction; it's believed Bossie OD'd on heroin. His struggle with drugs included six prior overdoses. A GoFundMe page set up to cover Bossie's funeral expenses noted the investment the family made in trying to get help for Bossie, there described as someone who  purposely confronted life, always trying to please the people he loved while balancing personal demons.  Bossie died a day after a 26-year-old Ohio man whose obituary was even more explicit about his heroin overdose.  All of the wonderful blessings that he had: talent, friendships, positive outlook on life, and, most importantly, family were sidelined by a wrong decision to do drugs,  wrote Alex Hesse's family.

The White House is looking into a number of such measures, hoping especially to help those who haven’t yet felt the recovery. Several legislators were already working on proposals to compensate Social Security recipients, who, because inflation has been non-existent, aren’t getting a cost-of-living increase for the first time in 30 years.

God's Little People Cat Rescue, which started with one stray mama cat and her two kittens, expanded to more than 60 cats roaming the Bowells' property as they continued to take in strays. They posted a Facebook ad for a modestly paid job managing the sanctuary—and 40,000 people responded. The ad went viral, spawning headlines about the  dream job  or  purrrfect job,  leading the Bowells to explain to would-be caretakers that it would, in fact, often be a difficult job—not only would poop have to be scooped and the like, but  heartbreaking decisions  would need to be made about sick cats. Months later, as the Washington Post reports, the sanctuary's caretaker has been chosen. Jeffyne Telson's husband sent her the ad soon after it was posted in August, the 62-year-old recalls. Telson runs her own cat rescue in Santa Barbara, Calif., only taking in strays; she's adopted out 3,000 cats and kittens over the past 21 years and has kept those who can't be placed at her own small sanctuary. Her application stood out, and the Bowells traveled to California to visit the couple in September. Joan and Jeffyne clicked immediately, and the Bowells offered Telson the job.

"(Sep 28, 2015  9:23 AM CDT) Soliris is one of the world's most expensive drugs, running about $500,000 a year in the US. In Canada, a year's supply of the drug, used to treat two rare blood diseases—paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (AHUS)—is even pricier at about $525,000 a year, reports the CBC. Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board argues Soliris is in fact more expensive in Canada than anywhere else in the world, which is why it began hearings in June to pressure Connecticut-based manufacturer Alexion Pharmaceuticals to lower the drug's  excessive  price. Did Alexion budge? No. Instead, it's taking the government to court in the hope that it can force the hearings to stop and block any order that might affect the price of Soliris, which has earned Alexion $6 billion in revenue over eight years. A health law expert calls Alexion's decision to challenge Canada's authority to regulate drug prices  the single greatest threat to pricing of drugs in Canada ever.  The US and Chile are the only nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that don't control drug prices, reports the Globe and Mail. Alexion says Soliris' price has been unchanged during its six years on the Canadian market and  allegations of excessive pricing  are instead based  on exchange rate fluctuations in the value of Canadian currency,  per Vice. As Soliris mitigates the effects of PNH and AHUS—which attack red blood cells, causing anemia, organ failure, and death—patients can pay millions for the drug over a lifetime, though some Canadian provinces cover the cost. If Alexion is made to lower the price, it may be forced to repay governments for past overpayments.

"(Jan 11, 2017  9:27 AM) Steven McDonald spent the last 30 years of his life in a wheelchair, but the NYPD officer shot by a teen in Central Park chose forgiveness, becoming  an international emblem,  per CNN. McDonald died Tuesday at a Long Island hospital at age 59, just days after suffering a heart attack, the NYPD announced—and his inspirational story is once more making the rounds, per the New York Times.  No one could have predicted that Steven would touch so many people, in New York and around the world,  said NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill.  Like so many cops, Steven joined the NYPD to make a difference in people's lives. And he accomplished that every day.  McDonald was just 29, with a pregnant wife and only two years on the force, when he was shot by 15-year-old Shavod Jones, whom he had stopped for loitering with two other boys on July 12, 1986. Doctors didn't think he'd make it more than a few months, but McDonald persevered and forgave.  I'm sometimes angry,  he said at son Conor's baptism, a few months after the shooting.  But more often I feel sorry for [Jones]. I forgive him and hope that he can find peace and purpose in his life.  The two even wrote each other—after McDonald sent stamps, stationery, and a note that said,  Let's start a dialogue —though that ended when McDonald declined to help Jones seek parole (Jones died in a motorcycle accident days after his 1995 release). McDonald traveled to schools, churches, and conflict-ridden areas around the globe to spread his message of faith and forgiveness, and to speak on gun control.

"(Oct 22, 2014  3:58 AM CDT) Canada's first ISIS casualty? A man described by authorities as a  radicalized  convert to Islam and possible recruit to the militant group ran down two soldiers in Quebec on Monday, killing one. Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, who had apparently waited for hours near a strip mall used by service members, was shot dead by police after a high-speed chase, reports the Toronto Star. Friends and relatives say he developed extreme views after converting around a year ago, but there was no sign that an attack was imminent. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, however, says it arrested Couture-Rouleau in July when he was making plans to travel to Turkey, possibly to join ISIS, and he was among 90 potential militant recruits under surveillance. The RCMP says it confiscated his passport in July but didn't charge him because there was no evidence he planned to commit any crimes in Canada or overseas. A spokesman says that even if he had been under 24-hour surveillance, the hit-and-run ambush might not have been stopped.  We didn't know his intention to use his car as a weapon,  he says. Authorities are now trying to determine whether he acted as a  lone wolf  or had direct ties to ISIS.

"(Apr 11, 2015  5:58 AM CDT) On November 25, 1965, Zella Jackson Price gave birth to a baby girl at Homer G. Phillips Hospital in St. Louis, her granddaughter says. What allegedly happened in the hours after that is both confusing and dreadful: Price, a gospel singer, says she was told by a nurse the baby died shortly after birth, and she went home heartbroken. But Melanie Diane Gilmore has been alive this whole time, adopted by another family, and the mother and daughter met at Price's Olivette, Mo., home last week for the first time, KTVI reports. Gilmore arrived in Price's driveway with her own daughter and son, and the two women embraced after their five-decade separation.  There's nothing greater than this,  Price said.  Nothing.  But what happened to Gilmore, who lost her hearing at the age of 3 from illness, is still a mystery. A post on the YouTube page of Melika Jackson, Gilmore's daughter, makes reference to someone who  decided to perform an unlawful act which involved the kidnapping of a child.  Jackson goes on to explain that, with a name given to Gilmore by her adoptive parents, Gilmore's kids searched for her biological mother and confirmed it was Price with DNA testing. Jackson also posted a video on Facebook on March 7 that shows how they broke the good news to Gilmore, as well as her first emotional face-to-face with Price via computer. The family says it will hire an attorney to look into what went down at the hospital, which USA Today notes closed in 1979.

"(Jan 29, 2014  7:25 AM) Three inches of snow may not sound like enough to shut down an entire big city, but it is quite enough when that city is Atlanta and the storm is, as the governor of Georgia said last night,  unexpected.  Drivers trying to get home from work spent as long as nine hours on the roads, which eventually iced over when temperatures dropped. The Wall Street Journal reports many roads were still gridlocked at midnight. Some kids even spent the night at school when buses weren't able to get them home, while other drivers spent the night in churches, fire stations, strangers' homes, and supermarkets. The governor and Atlanta's mayor admitted errors in the state's response to Winter Storm Leon, partially because it had been expected to hit more to the south. Workers are trying to clear the roads as quickly as possible (military Humvees are even being used, reports the AP), but with many abandoned cars, that's a difficult job.  It was like The Walking Dead out there,  says one man who left his car in a parking lot after more than five hours on the road last night and walked more than 6 miles to his house.

Today is the deadliest day of the year for American drivers, with an average 140 fatalities, and teenage drivers and their passengers account for nearly a tenth of those deaths, reports the Los Angeles Times. Road deaths in the US have dropped to their lowest level since 1949, but preliminary figures for last year show that the number of teens dying in car crashes has risen for the first time since 2003. Traffic deaths surge on the 4th of July because schools and offices are shut and more people are on the road, according to the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety. The institute's study of car crashes between 2006 and 2010 ranked Sept. 26 as the second-deadliest day, with an average 129 fatalities, and Aug. 2 the third-deadliest, with an average 125 deaths. A higher proportion of road deaths are caused by drunk drivers on the 4th of July than on a typical day, the institute says.

They date back to 1915, when an advance team for Sir Ernest Shackleton called the Ross Sea Party arrived to set up supply depots for the last leg of Shackleton's journey across Antarctica. But the team's ship, the Aurora, was blown out to sea in a blizzard, and the ten men had to survive together in a hut, reports Huffington Post.

"(May 5, 2014  1:22 PM CDT) Seattle's plan to raise its minimum wage to $15 will be great for economists—the city will become a  gigantic laboratory for one of the most ambitious, and quite possibly misbegotten, labor market experiments in recent memory,  observes Jordan Weissmann at Slate. But it probably won't be good for Seattle. While there's evidence both for and against raising the minimum wage, the evidence for it generally assumes that it won't rise too high or too fast. Seattle's plan would give it possibly the highest wage floor in the world.  Any plan that makes hiring a worker more expensive than in France should be cause for concern,  Weissman argues. Employers in such high-wage European countries have flocked to automation, replacing workers with digital checkout counters. Seattle's businesses could follow suit, if they don't just pack up and move to the far cheaper suburbs around the city. Still, Weissman is  oddly glad  Seattle's trying this.

"(Jul 25, 2012  3:54 PM CDT) Airlines are raking in enormous piles of cash from add-ons and fees.

Travis Lewis, paroled in 2018, killed McKay's daughter, Martha McKay, a few houses down from the initial crime scene on Wednesday before jumping into the lake and drowning, Crittenden County Sheriff Mike Allen says, per the Commercial Appeal.

He adds that Lewis, 39, jumped into a vehicle and drove across the yard, becoming stuck, per WMC. He then  ran and jumped into the lake. He was observed going under the water and never came back up.  Authorities used sonar equipment to locate the body of Lewis, who had drowned, according to Allen. McKay, in her mid-60s, was  found deceased inside the house  where she lived. She'd been stabbed, according to neighbors who spoke with deputies, per the Appeal.

His longtime agent tells the news agency that Sharif died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital. His grandson Omar Sharif Jr., who had just last week posted a photo of himself and his grandfather on Facebook with the message  I love you,  simply tweeted this morning,  Al-Baqa Lillah,  an Arab expression used to convey condolences. The Telegraph reports that Sharif had suffered from Alzheimer's, and in May his only child, Tarek El-Sharif told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo his dad couldn't remember certain details about his films.  He remembers, for example, that it was Doctor Zhivago but he's forgotten when it was filmed,  El-Sharif said. Sharif garnered an Oscar nomination for his turn as Sherif Ali in Arabia, even though he wasn't Lean's first choice—the actor Lean had picked was rejected for having the wrong eye color, per NBC News. Sharif was brought back by Lean for Zhivago then went on to rack up more than 100 acting credits, including roles as Mongol chief Genghis Khan in the 1965 eponymous movie, Che Guevara in 1969's Che!, and as a gambler in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand, a movie that was banned in Egypt because Sharif played a Jew, NBC reports.

"(May 6, 2011  7:51 AM CDT) Employers added more than 200,000 jobs in April for the third straight month, the biggest hiring spree in five years. But the unemployment rate rose to 9% in part because some people resumed looking for work. The Labor Department says the economy added 244,000 jobs last month. Private employers shrugged off high gas prices and created 268,000 jobs—the most since February 2006. The gains were widespread. Retailers, factories, financial companies, education, health care, and even construction companies all added jobs. Federal, state, and local governments cut jobs. The data suggests businesses are confident in the economy despite weak growth earlier this year. Still, unemployment increased slightly from March's 8.8%, the first increase since November.","Unemployment Rises to 9%, but Hiring Is Up"

Though it doesn't officially go on sale until April 24, customers could order the watch online in advance starting this morning. After just six hours, delivery dates had been pushed back to June for all models, reports the Washington Post. That suggests the initial stock quickly sold out, though CNET notes it's not clear whether that's more because of low supply or high demand, or a little bit of both.  We view this as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor,  an analyst with Piper Jaffray wrote in a note to investors, reports Bloomberg. Customers can also visit Apple stores to check out the watch, though they can't actually take one home.

The Daily Dot reports that the 60-year-old former host of To Catch a Predator now runs a YouTube channel called Have a Seat With Chris Hansen, and last week, Hansen showed up at the home of YouTuber Onision—who has also gone by the names Gregory Jackson, James Jackson, and Gregory Avaroe—to try to get an interview with the 34-year-old. Mashable notes that for the past few months, Hansen has been interviewing women who say Onision, who's been accused of child grooming and emotional abuse, and his spouse, Kai Avaroe, had groomed them when they were underage. When Hansen showed up at Onision's door last week, however, the YouTube star tried to flip the script by calling authorities.  Hi, uh, there's a person who's been stalking me online, and they just showed up to my house,  Onision is heard saying in the 911 call obtained by Hansen. (Listen to the full call here, or read the transcript.) When the dispatcher asks Onision if he can ID the person at his door, Onision replies:  It's Chris Hansen.  Onision says that a 19-year-old he rebuffed due to their  mental disorder  and negativity went to Hansen  and said a bunch of mean things about me, and so now this person is like, trying to aggressively pursue me in a really hateful way.  Per Insider, Hansen says his camera crew and an attorney he'd brought along remained in the street and weren't being threatening, as Onision claims.

These guys have never gone away. I'm shocked that people are shocked that this happened,  the ATF's Los Angeles chief tells the Wall Street Journal. He was part of a team that infiltrated the Hells Angels more than a decade ago. The Hells Angels, along with the Bandidos, are among the biggest outlaw groups in the US, but the Justice Department says there are more than 300 active ones, the Journal reports. The Waco shootout is believed to have stemmed from a Bandidos-Cossacks feud over the latter club's wearing of a  Texas  patch. Police in Waco have called for a truce between biker factions, the Waco Tribune-Herald reports. A police spokesman says the fighting on Sunday appears to have started after a biker's foot was run over outside the Twin Peaks restaurant, though he adds that investigators are finding witnesses and suspects deceptive. Around 170 bikers charged with engaging in organized crime are still in custody, though the wife of one of them tells the AP plenty of innocent bikers were rounded up. She says her husband—a member of the Vise Grip club—had just arrived when the shooting started. He took off and was arrested when he came back for his bike, she says.

Sheriff Brad Thurman says the 29-year-old deputy was fatally shot Saturday while responding to a report of a disabled vehicle blocking a rural road near Kalama, CNN reports. DeRosier was able to report to other deputies that he had been shot, but he died of his injuries soon after he was taken to a hospital in Vancouver, Wash. After a 22-hour manhunt, the suspected gunman was shot dead Sunday night, Longview Daily News reports. Thurman says the gunman was shot by two officers after emerging from woods carrying a firearm. It's not clear whether the gunman fired first.

"(May 19, 2016  8:31 AM CDT) A 13-year-old boy fatally shot Darlene Nevil, 46, twice on Aug. 17, 2010, then shot her husband five times. With a bullet lodged in his throat, Alan Nevil, 48, climbed out a window and reached a neighbor's yard in Garland, Texas, before identifying the boy as his stepdaughter's boyfriend. Alan Nevil died later in a hospital, but police say the boy—whom they found having celebratory sex with his 12-year-old girlfriend—admitted to shooting the Nevils on his girlfriend's orders; she had lied, telling him her stepdad had sexually abused her, police say.  He took responsibility almost immediately,  a detective said during a hearing Wednesday. But in what the Washington Post calls an  astonishing—and for the Nevil family, terrifying—twist,  a judge has ordered the boy released when he turns 19 next month—just five years into a 28-year sentence.  Five years? For capital murder?  Alan Nevil's son shouted in court, per the Dallas Morning News. It's a strange turn of events considering the boy has been involved in 64 incidents—including assault and possession of a controlled substance—while in detention. However, officials say he has lately changed course, getting his GED, working as a groundskeeper, and becoming a role model for others. He'll attend anger management classes and spend six months to a year on supervised parole, then remain on adult parole until 2038.

The more deadly blaze was at a garment factory in Karachi, the country's economic heart. The death toll from that fire rose to 191, most of which were caused by suffocation as people caught in the basement were unable to escape when it filled with smoke, firefighters said. There were no fire exits, and the doors leading out of the basement were locked, said a firefighter. It's unclear what caused the fire.  I jumped from my seat as did others and rushed toward the windows, but iron bars on the windows barred us from escaping,  one worker said.

Reuters notes that this year's day at the polls on April 17 was the first time the nation merged its parliamentary and national votes with the presidential one, mainly to save money. That move, however, has come with a sobering cost: More than 270 election workers have been reported dead as of Saturday night by the KPU elections commission, and not from any sort of violence at the polling booths. Instead, the deceased workers succumbed to what a KPU rep says were mainly exhaustion-related illnesses after spending hours counting paper ballots by hand. Nearly 1,900 other workers fell ill from the overwork, the rep adds. Quartz lays out the math on how the task could have been such a grueling one: About 150 million people are estimated to have voted, and each person could turn in up to five paper ballots—leaving a potential 750 million ballots to be hand-counted. Around 6 million workers were said to be working the booths at around 800,000 polling stations, per CNN.  The KPU is not prudent in managing the workload of staff,  a worker for presidential opposition candidate Prabowo Subianto told local media, via Reuters.

"(Jun 1, 2011  4:40 PM CDT) If you're wondering where all your money has gone, odds are a millionaire added it to his or her pile. Although millionaires make up just 0.9% of the world's population, they control 39% of its wealth—up 2% since 2009—according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. Their collective wealth has risen from $41.8 trillion to $47.4 trillion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The number of millionaire households—those with $1 million or more in investable assets not including homes, company ownership and luxury goods—also swelled by 12.2% last year to 12.5 million. The US boasts far more millionaires than any other country with 5.2 million, followed by Japan with 1.5 million. The super-rich keep getting super-richer, too, as those with $5 million or more gained an additional 2% of the world's wealth last year, increasing their total to 22% of all the money in the world.",Millionaires Have 39% of the World’s Money
"(Nov 6, 2016  11:01 AM) An effort to reinvent Nigeria's overloaded transportation infrastructure is running into opposition from environmental groups, the Smithsonian reports. Conservation groups say a proposed 162-mile superhighway through Nigeria's southern Cross River State will have severe repercussions on more than half of the country's remaining rainforests, and the project will also dislocate populations of both people and animals, including around a million people and some communities of critically endangered lowland gorillas. Activists are calling out the superhighway project's developers because they're seeking a 12-mile right-of-way allowance on either side of the highway, Quartz reports; the usual right-of-way is only 50 meters.  This project will take a quarter of the land in the state,  says one activist.  It is a pure land grab.  The superhighway project is part of the Nigerian government's efforts to address the shoddy state of the country's roads, which are poorly maintained and see some of the worst gridlock in the world. The highway was approved by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari more than a year ago, but it then emerged that an Environment Impact Assessment hadn't been done. Environmentalists managed to get construction halted while the EIA was performed. The final draft of the EIA was submitted on November 1, although activists say it's a sham. A spokesperson for the Cross River State government said:  Is it that we don’t need infrastructure? The forest you are protecting, who owns the forest? The forest is ours.  He added:  But we are not insensitive. For every tree destroyed, two more will be planted.",A 12-Lane WiFi-Enabled Highway Project Divides Nigeria
"(Apr 23, 2018  7:52 AM CDT) A 12-year-old Australian boy has pulled off a bold feat that is drawing international headlines: He stole his mom's credit card and managed to fly to Bali, Indonesia, for a posh, four-day vacation before getting caught, reports 9 News. As recounted in the Australian program A Current Affair, the boy did some research online and figured out he could fly alone without needing a letter from a parent on Jetstar Airways. He nabbed his mom's credit card, tricked his grandmother into giving him his passport, took a train to the airport, and flew to Bali.  They just asked for my student ID and passport to prove that I’m over 12 and that I’m in secondary school,  says the boy, identified only as Drew. He then checked into a four-star hotel, having made reservations in advance, telling the clerk that his older sister would be joining him soon, per stuff.co.nz. And there he stayed, having a fine time while his panicked mom reported him as missing back home. It wasn't until the boy posted a video of himself in the hotel pool that his vacation finally came to an end.  I was shocked and disgusted, there’s no emotion to feel what we felt when we found out that he’d left overseas,  says mom, per news.com.au. One reason she's ticked: Her son had actually tried this stunt twice before, only to be turned away at the airport by Qantas and Garuda Airlines. Mom says she was informed her son's passport would be flagged by federal authorities as a result, but that apparently never happened. In the aftermath, Jetstar promises to tighten up its policies.  He just doesn’t like the word no and that’s what I got, a kid in Indonesia.

A local tourist agency organized a trip for four tourists to an off-limits area on Sunday evening, according to the Xinhua News Agency. The group of 10, which included three herders who acted as porters, two cooks, and a tour guide, encountered an avalanche, and one Australian and the three local herders died.

No late appeals were filed for Juan Martin Garcia, who was lethally injected for the September 1998 killing and robbery of Hugo Solano in Houston. Solano, a Christian missionary from Guadalajara, Mexico, had moved his family to the city just weeks earlier so his children could be educated in the US. Garcia, who was 18 at the time of the killing and a street gang member, was identified as the ringleader of four men involved in the robbery. The 35-year-old apologized to Solano's relatives in Spanish in the moments before the execution. Solano's wife and daughter sobbed and told the inmate they loved him.  The harm that I did to your dad and husband—I hope this brings you closure,  Garcia said from the death chamber gurney, his voice breaking.  I never wanted to hurt any of you all.  He told his sister and several friends in English that he loved them.  No matter what, remember my promise,  he said.  No matter what, I will always be with you.  As the dose of pentobarbital began, he winced, raised his head, and then shook it. He gurgled once and snored once before his movement stopped. He was pronounced dead 12 minutes later.

Hired to report on Disney in 2007, however, he began visiting several of the parks on business. Soon, a burning curiosity made him visit the full set as only  the hardest of the hard-core Disneyphiles  have done, he writes at the New York Times. He ate Disney-shaped dim sum in Hong Kong, discovered  chocolate Toy Story-themed mochi dumplings  in Tokyo, and learned the Disney castle in Paris  is the most extravagant.  He admits,  I am now a full-fledged member of this obsessive Mickey Mouse Club.  For some, the compulsion to visit all Disney parks may lie in the human fascination with collecting.  These people, like all travelers, are collecting experiences,  a cultural studies professor explains, though  some probably really do just love the experience that Disney offers.  Barnes found that  far from monolithic, the company’s theme park empire is full of quirky surprises.

"(Jan 16, 2017  6:40 AM) When Candace Derksen went missing on her way home from school in Winnipeg in the fall of 1984, it took six weeks for volunteers to find her body—just a few hundred yards from her home, in a storage shed, where the 13-year-old who loved horses had been bound with twine and left to die of exposure. That desperate wait would prove to be the blink of an eye compared to how long it's taken for her family to see justice. Now, almost exactly 32 years since Candace was found, her parents are bracing for another trial of the man whose DNA was linked to the twine and at the scene, reports Winnipeg TV News. Mark Edward Grant was arrested and charged with the killing in 2007, then convicted in 2011, but the verdict was overturned two years later. The Manitoba Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge should have let the defense present evidence that a similar case had occurred nearby in 1985, where someone used the same knots to tie up another girl and leave her for dead in a shed—while Grant was in custody for another crime, reports the CBC. No suspect has been charged in that case, but the new trial is expected to include evidence of a third person involved in both crimes. Grant, who is in his 50s, insists he's innocent.  I have a hope that we'll get to the bottom of it this time,  Derkson's mother, Wilma, tells the Winnipeg Free Press. The trial starts Monday and is expected to last 34 days.

"(Dec 28, 2017  5:04 AM) It's going to be a happy new year for Rangeela and Sridevi: A wildlife group says it has rescued the sloth bears from owners in Nepal who forced them to dance to entertain crowds, National Geographic reports. The bears were swiped from the wild at a young age and their owners  had pierced their noses with a burning hot rod and shoved a rope through it so he could control them,  World Animal Protection says. The group says the bears are believed to have been the last two dancing bears in Nepal, which officially banned the practice 40 years ago. Police confiscated the bears after the owners were tracked down in a remote village. The animals are now at a national park in Nepal and will be given a permanent home at a wildlife sanctuary next year. The rescued sloth bears, 15 and 17 years old, showed signs of trauma including cowering and paw-sucking, wildlife officials say. Mary Hutton, founder of the Free the Bears group, tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that dancing bears are generally kept in  appalling  conditions, often by owners who can't afford to feed them more than a few pieces of bread a day. The group says it has helped end the practice in several other countries, including India, where more than 600 bears were freed during a 15-year campaign. Wildlife protection groups say a major part of the effort is finding new employment for the owners of dancing bears, which is why two of the owners in Nepal were given temporary jobs helping to look after the animals instead of being charged or fined.",Police Confiscate Country's Last 2 Dancing Bears

In an effort to gain insight into how Karen Kraushaar responded to workplace conflict, the AP takes a look into the past of the 55-year-old Kraushaar, who has now stepped into the spotlight by publicly calling for all Cain's accusers to step forward. Kraushaar's 2002 claim alleged unfair treatment after her supervisors at the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused to let her work from home after a car accident; it also cited a sexist email forward that a supervisor circulated at work that listed reasons men and women were like computers (in the case of men,  you have to turn them on  to get their attention). The complaint was handled internally, but Kraushaar initially sought thousands of dollars, a reinstated leave, a promotion worth $12,000 to $16,000 annually, and a Harvard fellowship, according to an anonymous INS supervisor. Kraushaar says she doesn't remember seeking payment, and later took a job at Treasury and dropped the complaint, which she calls  relatively minor.

DeLoreans—the vehicle made famous in the Back to the Future movie franchise—are heading back into production in Humble, Texas, and it will be the first time the iconic car will be manufactured on American soil.  It's fantastic. It is a game-changer for us,  DeLorean CEO Stephen Wynne tells KPRC. Wynne notes that he's got enough parts to put together about 300 cars, and although he anticipates initial output to be just one car a month, he's hoping to jack that to one a week. The first car is slated to be finished by early 2017. The anticipated price for one of these future throwbacks: $45,000 to $55,000 for a refurb, a vague  less than $100,000  for a new model. The original Back to the Future gave the DMC-12—the only model DeLorean ever made, per the Daily Dot—a high profile, but the company went down the tubes in part thanks to founder John DeLorean's drug and money problems, notes NBC Washington. Wynne came along in the mid-'80s, scooped up what was left of the company, rebranded it as the DeLorean Motor Company, and moved operations to the Houston area, but he was limited to refurbishing existing DeLoreans: A government rule made it illegal for low-volume production of cars that didn't meet current safety standards. But a recent federal highway bill now allows for a company to build up to 325 such replicas a year under certain conditions, and the DeLorean qualifies.  It's huge for us.

The prosecution  engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence and documents as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case,  Khan's lawyer, HM Saraswat, tells Gulf News.  It even failed to prove that the black bucks were killed by gunshots.  His lawyers said Khan had only an air gun that couldn't have taken down an antelope, per CNN; Khan has suggested the animals died from overeating.

"(Sep 15, 2015  3:48 PM CDT) The Food and Drug Administration is ordering a ban on sales of four cigarette brands from RJ Reynolds because they do not meet the agency's safety review requirements. Under FDA rules, companies that launch new cigarettes must show that the products are essentially the same as older products in terms of health risks. The FDA said four brands from RJ Reynolds failed to show that they don't raise new safety concerns: Camel Crush Bold, Pall Mall Deep Set, Pall Mall Deep Set Menthol, and Vantage Tech 13. In 2009 the FDA gained authority to regulate some aspects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The agency can evaluate new tobacco products for their health risks and ban those that raise new or uncertain issues. The FDA action means it is illegal for retailers to sell or distribute the four cigarette brands. However, the agency said it will not take action for 30 days to give retailers time to dispose of the products.",FDA Bans Sales of 4 Brands of Cigarettes

"(Mar 27, 2019  12:19 PM CDT) Can regular farting equal bullying? An appeals court in Australia will have to decide based on a nearly $1.3 million lawsuit filed in 2017 by the former employee of a construction company, who refers to his ex-boss as  Mr. Stinky.  David Hingst, a 56-year-old former engineer of Melbourne's Construction Engineering, says supervisor Greg Short would enter Hingst's small, windowless office to fart  five or six times a day  as part of a larger conspiracy to terminate his employment, the Washington Post reports. Before Hingst was eventually laid off,  I would be sitting with my face to the wall and he would come into the room … fart behind me and walk away,  the engineer says, per News.com.au, adding he eventually sprayed deodorant at his superior.  I may have done it once or twice, maybe … but I can't recall,  Short told the Supreme Court of Victoria last year. He said if he had farted on or near Hingst, it was not with bad intentions, per the New York Daily News. The court also heard of alleged phone calls in which Short called Hingst  an idiot,  per the BBC, but ultimately Justice Rita Zammit dismissed the suit last April, noting there was  some inappropriate behavior in the office, including passing wind,  but that it  would not necessarily amount to bullying.  Hingst appealed, and the Court of Appeal heard his claims of harassment, psychiatric trauma, and  severe stress  on Monday.  [Short] thrusted his bum at me while he's at work,  he told the judges, per News.com.au. A ruling is expected Friday.

After learning that his 16-year-old son Rain's school bus route would pass the family home, Price decided to come out and wave at the bus every day—wearing a different costume each time. The 170 home-made costumes Price donned over the school year, documented at Wave At The Bus, included Star Wars characters, a chicken, Michael Jackson, and even a wedding dress complete with bouquet. Price says he got the idea for the costumes after his son asked him and his mother not to wave at the school bus.  I hope this lives with him for the rest of his life,  he tells the Deseret News.  He can use it against his kids and tell them, 'If you think you are embarrassed by me, you should have seen your grandfather.'

"(Jan 24, 2016  6:35 AM) Use of plastic has increased 20-fold in the past half-century; production of the ubiquitous material is expected to double again in the next 20 years (and nearly quadruple over the next 50). And, CNN Money reports, nearly a third of all plastic packaging  escapes collection systems.  As for where the rest goes, more than 8 million tons of plastics end up entering our oceans each year, where the pieces can survive for hundreds of years. There are believed to be 165 million tons of it in the ocean right now. We're dumping the equivalent of one garbage truck's worth into the ocean per minute; that's projected to jump to four per minute by 2050, according to a report released Tuesday by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation. And that report has an ominous warning: We're on track to have more plastic than fish, by weight, in the world's oceans by 2050. (Right now, the ratio is about 1:5, plastics to fish. And the discarded plastic that doesn't end up in the ocean is likely be put in a landfill; those two resting places end up holding about 70% of our plastic, the Washington Post reports. Just 5% of plastics are effectively recycled, according to the Guardian. It's not just a problem of pollution.  After a short first-use cycle, 95% of plastic packaging material value, or $80 to $120 billion annually, is lost to the economy,  the report says. The solution? A  new plastics economy,  per the report, that includes more recycling, reusable packaging, and compostable plastic packaging.  After-use plastics could, with circular economy thinking, be turned into valuable feedstock,  Martin R. Stuchtey, who helped produce the report, tells the Guardian.

"(Apr 6, 2018  11:30 AM CDT) Lakieth Smith probably regrets his decision to turn down a 25-year plea deal offered to the Alabama teen in March. On Thursday, the 18-year-old was sentenced to 65 years in prison on charges of burglary, theft, and felony murder, reports the Montgomery Advertiser. It was actually a police officer, not Smith, who shot and killed 16-year-old A'Donte Washington when officers encountered Washington, Smith, and three others breaking into two homes in Millbrook on Feb. 25, 2015. Some of the suspects fired at police, and Washington was shot four times as he aimed a revolver at one officer, who was cleared of wrongdoing. Under Alabama's accomplice law, a person can be held responsible for a death if it occurs during the commission of a crime. The four remaining suspects were charged. Jadarien Hardy, 22; Jhavarske Jackson, 23; and La'Anthony Washington, 22, ultimately took plea deals, per the Advertiser. But Smith rejected the 25-year recommended sentence offered. Convicted in March, he smiled and laughed during his sentencing, per WSFA.  I don't think Mr. Smith will be smiling long when he gets to prison,  says district attorney CJ Robinson. Noting Smith showed no remorse, Judge Sibley Reynolds handed down a 30-year sentence for felony murder, a 15-year sentence for burglary, and two 10-year sentences for theft, to be served consecutively.  It will be a long time before he comes up for even the possibility for parole, at least 20 to 25 years,  Robinson says.

He wrote it over the course of nearly two years spent at Dachau, a feat managed in part because of the job he was assigned as an office manager at a screw factory, which  provided him clandestine opportunities to keep a secret diary,  writes David Chrisinger for the New York Times Magazine, which highlights the diary as part of a series telling  lesser-known stories  from World War II. Kupfer-Koberwitz documented everything he could about the horrors of  a satanic world  in the diary, which he hid from guards in a wooden box with a false bottom. Once it was too large for even the box, he and a co-worker dug a hole in the factory's concrete floor in October 1944 and buried it, digging it out a week after Dachau was liberated. It is one of only a small number of surviving testimonies to have been written inside a German concentration camp. Most of those that do exist are in pieces and  almost none show Edgar's extraordinary powers of observation,  per Chrisinger. And  no detail was too small or too cruel for him to preserve.

That's based on FBI toxicology tests of Nathaniel Holmes, Cynthia Day, and Miranda Schaup-Werner, whose May deaths helped trigger a scare over allegedly counterfeit or poisoned alcohol in the Caribbean nation. But the FBI—which gave no explanation for the deaths—did eliminate methanol poisoning from alcohol, per the New York Times.

"(Oct 19, 2010  12:55 PM CDT) Vitamin B has already been linked to Alzheimer’s, but new evidence shows that vitamin B-12, specifically, may help to fend off the disease. In a recent study of 271 people published in the Neurology journal, those with the highest levels of B-12 were the least likely to have dementia, the BBC reports. Even so, one Alzheimer’s charity says it’s  too early  to recommend taking supplements of B-12, which is found in meat, fish, eggs, and milk. B-12 may protect against Alzheimer’s by lowering levels of a body chemical called homocysteine, which is associated with strokes and dementia. Another recent trial also found a link between high levels of B-12 and lower risk for dementia. For one researcher, that’s enough proof that a  large scale trial with homocysteine-lowering therapy using B vitamins  is warranted,  to see whether such a simple treatment may slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementia.

But adding to the horror of her experience, Imelda Cortez, now 20, is the one facing up to 20 years in prison after being accused of attempted murder due to her country's strict abortion laws, even though she says she didn't try to have an abortion, the Guardian and Reuters report. Cortez has been in custody since April of last year after she'd been rushed to the ER bleeding profusely and in pain; a doctor at the hospital suspected she'd tried to induce an abortion, which is banned in all circumstances in El Salvador. It turns out Cortez, who said she didn't even know she was pregnant, had given birth to a baby girl, who was found safe and healthy by cops. The Guardian notes Cortez's case underscores the plight that young, poor women in El Salvador face, with an abortion law that doesn't allow for one even in cases of rape, when the mother's life is in danger, or when the fetus isn't viable. Some women have been convicted even when they've had a miscarriage or stillbirth.  By shackling these women to hospital beds and sending them to prison, it sends a strong message: If you're poor, it's not safe to seek health care,  a human rights lawyer says. As for Cortez, she's  despondent,  her lawyer tells Reuters:  Her case could go either way. But if the judge is objective and looks at the evidence, Imelda should be set free.

"(May 18, 2011  3:05 AM CDT) The Catholic Church's requirement for all priests to be celibate is not to blame for the church's sex abuse scandals, according to a study commissioned by and partially funded by America's Catholic bishops. The study concludes that most sex abuse cases involved priests trained in the '40s and '50s who were left ill-equipped to deal with social upheaval and the rise in  sexual deviancy  in the '60s, AP reports. The study notes that abuse cases peaked in the '70s, and then declined sharply—a trend researchers say is due to priests being better trained in how to live a celibate life. The study concludes that homosexual priests were no more likely than heterosexual ones to abuse children, and that since abusers did not share a common profile, seminaries could not have done a better job screening for abusive priests. The researchers—using a very narrow definition of pedophile—say less than 5% of priests accused of abuse could be technically defined as pedophiles.

But the Agriculture Department confirms that's what has hit an egg producer in Osceola County, Iowa; it's the biggest outbreak so far in the current H5N2 bird flu epidemic. CNN reports that all of the hens will be euthanized; officials previously told the New York Times they didn't yet know how many of the 25 barns at the farm were affected, though birds in three barns had already been killed in an effort to halt the spread.  When there's an outbreak like this, you have to make sure the disease doesn't leave,  the state's ag secretary tells the Des Moines Register. Iowa is the biggest egg producer in the country, and the farm in question accounts for almost 10% of Iowa's egg-laying hens. The outbreak has hit chicken and turkey producers in 13 states, many in the Midwest—Gov. Scott Walker declared a state of emergency in Wisconsin yesterday and authorized the National Guard to get involved—and has killed almost 7.8 million birds since last month. The risk of transmission to people is considered to be low, and the egg market will likely only see a limited effect.",Iowa Farm's 5.3M Hens Will Be Killed

"(Aug 31, 2016  3:40 AM CDT) A petsitting company's attempt to sue for $1 million over a one-star Yelp review got zero stars from a Dallas County district court, which firmly rejected the lawsuit. The court also decided that Michelle and Robert Duchouquette, the couple being sued by Prestigious Pets,  would be awarded their reasonable attorney fees as well as sanctions to deter future such lawsuits,  according to Public Citizen. The Duchouquettes posted the bad review after hiring the company to look after their two dogs and betta fish during a trip to Texas, and returning to find that the betta fish had apparently been overfed. The company initially sued for nearly $7,000, but later filed a suit for the higher amount, claiming the couple had violated a non-disparagement clause in their agreement. The Duchouquettes filed an anti-SLAPP—Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation—motion, which allowed the court to strike down what it viewed as a frivolous lawsuit aimed at quashing the couple's right to free speech, the Dallas Morning News reports.  We are so grateful for the attorneys who have supported us through the case,  the couple said in a statement, per Consumerist.

"(May 10, 2014  1:54 PM CDT) Arkansas today issued its first gay-marriage licenses thanks to a rather bold deputy clerk in training, the Arkansas Times reports. The day after a judge struck down a state ban on gay marriage, about 50 couples arrived at the Eureka Springs courthouse this morning—and were told by the deputy county clerk that she wouldn't give out licenses because the county clerk was away. Apparently, she had called an attorney general for an opinion and, not hearing back, made the decision to shut down the courthouse, adds the Times. Police even asked everyone to leave. But minutes later, deputy clerk in training Jane Osborne reopened the doors and said she was  happy to do it.  The first to marry were Jennifer Rambo, 26, and Kristin Seaton, 27, who'd slept outside the courthouse overnight in their Ford Focus and woke up every half hour so they wouldn't miss the opening. Rambo's reaction when the license was issued, according to the AP:  Thank God.  Formidable forces had opposed them, including a state law banning same-sex marriage and a 2004 constitutional amendment that passed with 75% approval, Arkansas News notes.

But his request for his final Christmas is simple: He wants cards.  He got some cards from this Halloween, and he opened up and saw them and it was like getting a gift. He read it to us and had a big smile on his face and his nose scrunched,  Jacob's dad tells CNN.  He was excited to see what people had to say and it just brightened his day.

"(Sep 12, 2018  1:48 PM CDT) The creator of Designing Women and Evening Shade, described by the Hollywood Reporter as one of CBS' biggest hitmakers, has written a powerful piece for the Reporter taking disgraced former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves to task. But, as the headline of Linda Bloodworth Thomason's piece notes,  not all harassment is sexual.  Rather, Moonves carried out a  personal vendetta  to keep Bloodworth Thomason's shows off the network and keep her out of work for seven years right at the  pinnacle  of her career, she alleges. Before he took over, her shows were celebrated by CBS execs and she was given  carte blanche  to tackle such subjects as sexual harassment and domestic violence. Then in 1995, three years after she was given the largest writing and producing contract in the network's history at $50 million, Moonves took the reins. He proceeded to decline all of her pilots, all while keeping her hope alive that eventually something would end up on air. She doesn't know why he sidelined her, though she wonders if her shows'  admittedly aggressive, feminist agenda  had something to do with it. Over the years, she watched as he turned CBS from a network that championed strong female characters to a network full of  macho crime shows featuring a virtual genocide of dead naked hotties in morgue drawers.  And so she bids Moonves good riddance, writing she's  happy to dance on his professional grave.  To all the sexual predators in the entertainment industry, she warns,  We are not going to stop until every last one of you is gone. We don't care anymore if you go to jail or go to hell.

Now, a case out of southern Austria hints at what could happen when those kids grow up. An 18-year-old woman says that her parents since 2009 have posted some 500 photos of her (stretching back to her baby days) on Facebook without her OK, and she's suing. The unnamed woman says she's repeatedly asked that they remove the images—which show her doing everything from potty training to lying naked in bed and have been shared with her parents' 700 friends—to no avail, reports the Local. But hey, those friends like the photos, the woman's father tells a local magazine by way of Deutsche Welle:  It's a nice family album that's been well received by our Facebook friends.

"(Jan 24, 2014  10:27 AM) Polish prosecutors intend to look into a Washington Post report alleging that the CIA in 2003 handed Polish intelligence agents two cardboard boxes stuffed with $15 million in cash as a payoff to use a Polish facility as perhaps the agency's most infamous  black site  prison. The report could be explosive, because if Polish officials did cooperate with the CIA, they could be prosecuted, as could politicians who were in power at the time. A prosecution spokesperson tells Reuters that the report will be analyzed for new evidence. Human rights groups say prosecutors already have evidence of Polish officials' involvement with the black site, but have held off on charges for fear of political repercussions. Officially, Poland denies that the secret jail ever existed. The Post provides a detailed report on the origins of the site, a two-story villa on a Polish intelligence service training base that the CIA secured to replace a site it was using in Thailand (that one described by one former agency official as  just a chicken coop we remodeled ). Polish officials continued to visit the site's common lunch room, but didn't have access to the detainees. The report also details the interrogation and torture of Abu Zubaida (who proved eager to help), Khaleid Sheikh Mohammed (who was very hard to break), and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (whom interrogators quarreled about, with some convinced he was a major terror figure, and others believing he was  an idiot  who  couldn't read or comprehend a comic book. ) Read the Post's full report here.",Report: CIA Gave Poland $15M for Use of 'Black Site'

A new Swiss company called Erfolgswelle offers to create a list of globally unique baby names and pare them down with clients until they pick one, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.  We follow a creation process that takes around 100 hours,  company CEO Marc Hauser tells BuzzFeed. For $32,000, copywriters cook up names, historians ensure their uniqueness, translators check they won't offend in any language, and lawyers make sure they aren't trademarked. Then, presto, you get a list from which to choose five favorites. Erfolgswelle will even send your faves to 780 people who pick their faves. Yet  the family is always in charge—they have the rudder in their hands,  says Hauser. Once a favorite is picked (Blue Ivy and Apple are taken, people!) the company writes up a mythology and history of the name.  Based on the elements of the new name, we create a story with a positive message,  Hauser says.  That’s why all the parts of the name need a positive message in it.  He promises a personal touch, too, telling ABC News that each name must fit  within the family's culture and background.  He won't reveal their client list, baby names, or tricks of the trade, but tells the Daily Mail that the name must  roll off the tongue,  so, for example, no first name will end  with the same letter that the surname begins with.

"(Sep 8, 2013  8:14 AM CDT) Amid all the uproar over chemical weapons in Syria comes this surprising revelation: What could be the earliest archaeological evidence of chemical weapons was uncovered in the country—and it is some 1,700 years old. A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains Discovery News. It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation:  I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel.  Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

"(Mar 18, 2019  6:01 AM CDT) Two new reports suggest more trouble for Saudi's crown prince. The New York Times is out with a front-page story alleging a brutal campaign authorized by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to abduct and torture dissidents that began more than a year before the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Guardian, meanwhile, reports that the crown prince appears to have lost some authority, at least temporarily, on the orders of his ailing father, King Salman. The king is apparently worried about a big drop in investments coming in to Saudi Arabia after it was revealed that a special Saudi security team murdered Khashoggi. The kingdom has denied allegations that the crown prince personally ordered the journalist's killing, but the new Times piece will only add to the speculation about him. The story is based on interviews with American officials who have read classified intelligence reports about a secret campaign to curb dissent that ramped up in 2017, when the crown prince assumed broad new powers. This Saudi Rapid Intervention Group sometimes abducted Saudis living elsewhere and brought them home to be detained and abused, often in palaces owned by the royal family. Women's rights activists were among those rounded up and subjected to abuse that included electric shocks, beatings, and threats of rape and murder. The Times says one such detainee, linguistics professor Eman al-Nafjan, attempted to kill herself because of the harsh treatment.

Now event directors want the tiara back:  She thinks as long as she keeps this crown she's the winner,  media rep David Kim tells the AP.  She's not.  According to the pageant, things went sour when they convinced the 18-year-old to get bigger breasts for future video and singing deals. The pageant footed the $10,000 bill:  It's our responsibility,  Kim said.  If she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it's breasts, then breasts.  But Kim says Noe's resulting trip to Seoul with her mom dragged on for months in an  illegal attempt  to obtain a visa, the Daily News reports (a power clash between event organizers and Noe's mom may be fueling all this, says the BBC). Either way, many fans on Facebook are taking Noe's side and dismissing the pageant's statement.

But its growth will level off around 2065—meaning Nigeria looks on track to be No. 1 in the subsequent decades.

"(Jul 26, 2016  4:43 PM CDT) After two decades of searching, archaeologists have finally discovered the location of a Spanish fort missing for 450 years: a golf course in South Carolina, the Beaufort Gazette reports. According to the AP, Fort San Marcos—built in 1577 and occupied for five years—was discovered last month under a golf course on Parris Island by two researchers. They used improving technology, included radar and magnetic waves, to succeed where years of old-fashioned hole digging had failed, the Post and Courier reports. While the remains of Fort San Marcos are still buried, the location in itself is a hard-won and important find.  This work will allow us to tell the story of the land that would eventually become the United States,  one of the researchers says. Fort San Marcos was built more than 100 years before English settlers arrived in what is now South Carolina. Spanish documents give a description and drawing of the fort, but not its location—that was finally given away by the fort's old post holes. Fort San Marcos was built in the settlement of Santa Elena, which was discovered in 1979—nearly 100 years after it was abandoned in the midst of attacks by the English.

I always say how bullied I am, but no one listens,  Jamey Rodemeyer wrote in his blog earlier this month.  What do I have to do so people will listen to me?

He was the sweetest, kindest kid you'd ever know,  his mom Tracy Rodemeyer told the Buffalo News.  He touched so many hearts, so many people.

"(Feb 9, 2018  10:56 AM) Uber is settling a lawsuit filed by Google's autonomous car unit alleging that the ride-hailing service ripped off self-driving car technology. Both sides in the case issued statements confirming the settlement Friday morning in the midst of a federal court trial in the case, per the AP. Google's Waymo unit says Uber agreed to take steps to make sure Waymo technology isn't used in Uber's autonomous vehicles. Waymo says Uber also agreed to pay about $245 million—but in Uber equity, not cash, per the Verge.  This is all equity; zero cash,  one source tells the website.  It means Waymo is invested in Uber’s future.  Uber's CEO says in a statement that the company doesn't believe trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber and that Uber is taking steps to make sure its self-driving vehicle research represents only Uber's work. The settlement is a surprise after five days in court, and it comes after Uber rejected a $1 billion settlement offer before the trial began.

"(Aug 24, 2016  8:53 AM CDT)  Get rid of the gouda  isn't something you'd expect from a government directive, but that's the gist of what the Department of Agriculture is doing to ease the country's cheese crisis. By  crisis,  we mean there's more cheese stockpiled and languishing in the US than there has been in three decades, per CNNMoney, and the USDA announced Tuesday it will spend $20 million to scoop up 11 million pounds of the excess dairy product from private inventories and distribute it to food banks and pantries nationwide.  This commodity purchase is part of a robust, comprehensive safety net that will help reduce a cheese surplus that is at a 30-year high while, at the same time, moving a high-protein food to the tables of those most in need,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says. To put the surplus in context, the Wall Street Journal noted in May that every American would have to scarf down an extra 3 pounds of cheese in 2016 to get rid of the excess.  The US is sitting on more butter and cheese than it knows what to do with,  Bloomberg lamented in April, noting half of the US cheese inventory is American, 2% is Swiss, and the rest falls under  other.  The USDA says it decided to act after receiving pleas from farmers groups, Congress, and the National Milk Producers Federation to help pull them out of the cheese mire, a result of low prices worldwide, plentiful milk inventories (and ample European exports), and slowed demand, among other factors. The consequence of this sluggish market: Dairy farmers have seen their revenues plummet 35% over the past two years, the USDA notes.

"(Jul 27, 2015  12:14 PM CDT) What was supposed to be a joyous occasion turned into a bloodbath last night as two armed groups at an Afghan wedding got into a gunfight, killing 21 people—including two teen boys—and wounding at least eight others, an Afghan official says, per CNN. The shooters, most of whom were guests at the wedding in Baghlan province, were believed to be members of illegal local militias, not the Taliban or al-Qaeda, NBC News reports. Although CNN says the cause of the fight was  unclear,  the police chief of the Dih Salah district of Baghlan tells the AP it appears the fight broke out after a relative of a provincial police officer was killed during the celebration for a local mullah's son, for which 400 or so people had gathered at a private house. Meanwhile, the police chief tells the Guardian that   a local security official fired in the air after the verbal exchange heated up … and then both sides started trading fire.  The paper notes that  celebratory gunfire  and fatal shootouts are  woefully common  in the region. The paper cites a December wedding in which 17 women and children were killed after Afghan army soldiers heard such celebratory gunfire and blasted mortars at the wedding party by mistake. The AP notes that Baghlan and other northern Afghan provinces have been riddled with insurgent attacks since the 2001 US-led invasion overthrew the Taliban, but it adds that local feuds and other criminal activity still proliferate under the cover of war.

The Facebook founder and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they're sinking $120 million into San Francisco-area schools over the next five years, the San Jose Mercury News reports. Some of that money will go to found new charter and public schools, and some will bolster the budgets of existing schools. The first $5 million will be directed to  high-need  neighborhoods, and will focus on principal training, classroom technology, and helping kids transition into high school, KTVU reports. It's the biggest outpouring so far from the $1.5 billion Silicon Valley Community Fund the couple founded last year.  Education is an incredibly personal issue for me,  Chan told the Today Show, because good teachers were especially important in directing her toward college; she was the first in her family to graduate from it (she's now a pediatrician). She also said the couple wants kids someday,  but we're so busy taking care of other people's children right now.

"(May 2, 2014  1:55 AM CDT) A Massachusetts town has decided it's time to finally lift a ban on arcade games it established when Ms. Pac-Man was new. At a town meeting, the residents of Marshfield voted 203-175 to lift the ban that was introduced in 1982 and went almost all the way to the Supreme Court when business owners challenged it (the court declined to take on the case), reports the Patriot Ledger. The ban was voted in by residents who feared arcade games would bring an undesirable element to the small town and upheld in 1994 and 2011.  This is a progressive step in that it protects life in a small town from an urban-type honky-tonk environment,  one resident told the Christian Science Monitor at the time.  The fewer distractions of that type, the easier it is to transfer my ideas and values to my youngster.  The ban was successfully challenged by a resident who says he found it unjust even when he was in the fourth grade.  I was sitting thinking, 'Why is this illegal in my town, to have fun with my friends,'  he says, recalling a visit to an arcade in a neighboring town. Six business owners say they are considering installing games, and while it's not clear whether they plan to bring in games from the decades the town missed, Chris Taylor at Mashable would love it  if Marshfield suddenly went hog wild and became a town filled with retro gaming devices.

"(Jun 7, 2013  4:17 PM CDT) Fourteen slaves who petitioned the New Hampshire Legislature for their freedom during the Revolutionary War were granted posthumous emancipation today when the governor signed a largely symbolic bill that supporters hope will encourage future generations to pursue social justice. Slaves who had fought in the war submitted a petition to the New Hampshire General Assembly on Nov. 12, 1779, while the war was still being fought. They argued that the freedom being sought by colonists should be extended to them, as well, and maintained that  public tyranny and slavery are alike detestable to minds conscious of the equal dignity of human nature.   Their plea fell on deaf ears,  Gov. Maggie Hassan said before signing the bill.  It is a source of deep shame that our predecessors didn't honor this request.  The original petition was found in state archives nearly 30 years ago, but supporters pushed lawmakers to pass the bill this year in part to bring attention to an African-American burial ground in downtown Portsmouth; the city is raising money to build a memorial park to commemorate the site.

The next deadline for reinstating the sanctions against Iran is in May, and the official says Trump will do so and remove the US from the nuclear deal at that time unless European allies agree to changes to the deal meant to permanently stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. Those changes include adding  triggers,  such as inspections of Iranian facilities, and removing  sunset clauses  that allow Iran to enrich uranium and more.

Per Reuters, one of the six had an arrest warrant connected to a 2017 attack on a military base, while another was once arrested for protesting the government in a street demonstration.

"(Sep 28, 2017  1:40 PM CDT) The US economy grew at an upgraded annual rate of 3.1% in the spring, the fastest pace in more than two years. But growth is expected to slow sharply this quarter in the wake of a string of devastating hurricanes, per the AP. The April-June expansion in the gross domestic product—the economy's total output of goods and services—is up slightly from a 3% estimate made a month ago, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It is the strongest performance since the economy grew at a 3.2% pace in the first quarter of 2015. The upward revision reflected larger farm stockpiles. The year started with a lackluster 1.2% gain in the first quarter. Economists believe growth has slowed again to around 2% in the current quarter. The revised figure was the government's third and final look at GDP for the April-June period, and left GDP rising at an average 2% pace over the first six months of the year. That matches the lackluster average annual growth rates seen since the recovery from the Great Recession began in mid-2009.

Ifergan says that in May 2008, he bought two tickets at 8:59pm, a minute before the 9pm cutoff, the CBC reports. The first ticket out of the convenience store's machine was for that night's draw but the next one—which had the draw's winning numbers—was printed at seven seconds after 9pm and was registered for the following week's draw. If the ticket had been printed a few seconds earlier, he would have shared a $21 million jackpot with another winner. Ifergan sued lottery authorities in Quebec, saying the processing lag was the fault of their slow system. Loto-Quebec never disputed  the fact that my request for the two tickets was in their system at 8:59.47,  he tells CTV, saying that  had those tickets been bought anywhere else in Canada, I would have been a millionaire seven years ago.  But the courts in Quebec ruled against him, and the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal yesterday.

But in spite of police questioning 12,000 men, only one suspect was ever arrested in the intervening five decades, and the case against him was ultimately thrown out for lack of evidence. Elsie's parents both died without learning who had killed their daughter, and her older sister and younger brother say that after all these years they want justice, and  didn’t want to die thinking we had not done anything.

Police were looking for two young men who carried out the attack in the Agouza district because they were previously not allowed to enter, state news agency MENA reported. The attack happened at the El Sayad restaurant, which isn't officially a nightclub but, like many establishments, skirts taboos around drinking in this predominantly Muslim country by serving food and alcohol throughout the day, then turning into a bar until the early morning hours. While alcohol is legal in Egypt, most restaurants and clubs don't have liquor licenses. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the Ministry of Interior cited an unnamed official with its Security Information Center who said a preliminary investigation showed the attack happened after a dispute between the nightclub staff and some other people, who then threw Molotov cocktails at the entrance. Online video posted by newspaper Youm7 showed thick black smoke pouring through the doorway of El Sayad as onlookers milled outside, unable to help. Flames were burning the inside of the building and charring the facade of the restaurant, located on the ground floor of an apartment building.","Cops: Men Denied Entry to Cairo Club Return, Kill 16"

Wearing the mask is less about you contracting the virus,  Biden said,  it's about preventing other people from getting sick.  The Democratic presidential candidate also responded to those who push back against such mandates, the AP reports.  This is America. Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens,  he said.  Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum—every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.  Biden and running mate Sen.

The Brooklyn man managed to fly from Cleveland to New York's LaGuardia Airport yesterday on a 76-seat plane that carried just two passengers. Initially, he was the only one. As O'Leary explains to ABC News, he was originally booked on a 7:15am Delta flight that ended up being canceled. The Brew York editor was placed on a 9:39am flight that was continually delayed, and instead of waiting it out at the airport, he remained at his hotel. He arrived at the airport to discover that everyone else had been moved to earlier flights; though Delta tried to page him to make the same arrangements for him, he wasn't there to hear them. (As the New York Daily News notes, he spent the passing hours lightly grumbling:  I’m sure @delta's doing all they can, but this still sucks.  That attitude changed once he boarded: He tweeted that he  got a personal safety briefing from my two flight attendants,  along with a grinning photo of himself on the otherwise empty plane. He ultimately had to share:  The thrill is gone, you guys. Just as we were about to push back, they reconnected the jet bridge to let a second passenger on the flight,  he tweeted, complete with crying emoji.

"(May 21, 2012  5:48 PM CDT) A New York auction house sold off a dinosaur skeleton for $1 million yesterday despite a restraining order from the Mongolian government, which said the find had been illegally exported, New Scientist reports. Heritage Auctions kept mum about the seller and winning bidder, and said it had  legal assurances  that the near-complete tyrannosaurus  was obtained legally.  A lawyer for Mongolia, however, said the auction house planned to hold back the sale until courts settled the dispute. Fossil smuggling is nothing new in Asia: Mongolia banned fossil exports more than 50 years ago, and China has seen its dinosaur and bird fossils fetch hefty prices abroad. In fact, a questionable dinosaur leg skeleton is awaiting sale at Christie's in London right now—probably worth $50,000 to $80,000.  It is very likely to be from Mongolia,  says a paleontologist who warned the auction house about the sale.  But as there is no provenance,  it may have been exported  prior to [Mongolia's] imposition of an export ban on fossils.",'Illegal' Dinosaur Skeleton Sells for Over $1M

Yesterday's average of $4.6140 was the highest since June 19, 2008, when it was $4.6096.  We use the phrase `the perfect storm,' and this current one makes those other perfect storms look like a drizzle. I don't want to scare anyone, but this is a big problem,  says an AAA analyst.  Run-outs are happening left and right.  Yesterday's price was the highest in the nation, with the Golden State leapfrogging Hawaii this week as the state with the most expensive fuel due to an outage at a refinery. Some fuming motorists paid $5 or more per gallon while station owners had to shut down pumps in others.  I seriously thought it was a mistake on the sign when we pulled in,  says one Los Angeles resident. AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge report said the national average was about $3.81 a gallon.

The goal is to increase inventory of items listed at a  buy-it-now  price, increasingly popular with buyers weary of waiting for auctions to play out. Listing items on Amazon is free, while eBay has made as much as  60% of its shopping revenue from upfront fees charged whether or not an item sells. The new system will mean 80% of its income will come from commissions. Amazon's fixed-price business has been surging, as eBay's has slumped.

Several individual European nations, including giant Germany, are already contracting, and forecasters see little sign of a turnaround soon.

What was ailing the nonagenarian turned out to be more horrifying than her family could have imagined, and now a judge has ordered the home to pay them $250,000 for wrongful death and for violating the Illinois Nursing Home Care Act, the Daily Herald reports. After a maggot was spotted moving in McCann's ear on Sept. 16, 2012, by a nursing home worker, she was whisked to a local hospital. There, her daughter watched as  the larvae of flies crawled out of her mother's left ear  as 57 maggots were removed, Chicago Tribune originally reported; it's thought that a fly landed in her ear and laid the eggs. McCann had been diagnosed with wax buildup a little over a week before the maggots were discovered and was prescribed eardrops, CBS News noted; Lutheran says she had received drops the night before her hospital visit.  How can you put drops of medicine in an ear that has 57 maggots?  the family's lawyer asked CBS in a November 2012 interview. After the maggots were taken out, the Herald notes, McCann lost her appetite, started humming, and died a few months later at another nursing home her family had moved her to.  The maggot infestation in her left ear created this geriatric cascade that led to her death,  their attorney notes to the Herald.

"(Jul 31, 2018  11:47 AM CDT) Keith King says no amount of money could make up for his busted marriage. Nonetheless, a North Carolina judge has ordered his wife's lover to pay him $8.8 million. The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called  alienation of affection,  reports WSOC. In this case, the 48-year-old King claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old Danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports WRAL and Inside Edition.  I've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings,  says King, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between King and Francisco Huizar that was recorded, followed by King learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this.  My marriage was murdered,  says King. Last week, a Durham County judge agreed, ordering Huizar to pay $2.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in North Carolina each year settled out of court. But this was  a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors,  King's attorney tells WRAL. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property. It's  archaic … and should be stricken,  says Huizar's lawyer, who claims King was controlling of his unhappy wife.  Verdicts like these … remove personal responsibility for a person's own marriage.

John Wayne Conner, 60, was put to death for beating a friend to death during an argument after a night of partying in January 1982, the AP reports. Warden Eric Sellers told witnesses the time of death was 12:29am. Conner didn't make a final statement and declined to have a prayer said for him. According to court documents, Conner beat his friend JT White to death on January 9, 1982, in the town of Milan, about 150 miles southeast of Atlanta, after a night of heavy drinking. Lawyers for Conner had argued that imposing the death penalty after he spent 34 years on death row was unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. They also said Conner was raised in poverty in a home where extreme violence and substance abuse were the norm and exhibited signs of mental impairment that led his teachers to believe he was intellectually disabled from an early age. Georgia executed five inmates last year and in 1987. Only five states have carried out death sentences this year, for a total of 15 executions.

Joseph Meli, 42, of Manhattan, and Steven Simmons, 48, of Wilton, Conn., were arrested on charges alleging they enticed wealthy individuals to make multimillion-dollar investments, the AP reports. The SEC said in a civil complaint that the Ponzi schemes led people in 13 states to invest $81 million. Meli's scheme included investments in businesses that would buy large blocks of tickets for major concerts and musicals, authorities said. The SEC said at least $51 million of the $81 million was diverted to pay off other investors or for personal expenses of the co-conspirators. Simmons wasn't charged in the civil complaint, but both men were charged criminally with conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud. According to a criminal complaint, the fraud stretched from November 2015 through January, and the Ponzi schemes developed as investors demanded their money.  Meli allegedly made up out of whole cloth purported deals to buy Broadway tickets that he could later sell at a profit,  Deputy US Attorney Joon H. Kim says.  But as alleged, Meli was just robbing Peter to pay Paul.  William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the FBI's New York office, notes that the defendants had joked about their Ponzi scheme, saying it was a  shell game.

The study out of Columbia University estimates that 36,000 fewer people would have died through early May if those measures began on March 8. If they began on March 1, the figure jumps to 54,000. Scientists came up with the estimates using models that took into account how transmission of the virus slowed once the guidelines did go into effect.  It's a big, big difference,  says Columbia epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman.  That small moment in time, catching it in that growth phase, is incredibly critical in reducing the number of deaths.  The story points out President Trump's reluctance to recommend coronavirus shutdown measures, calling attention to this tweet on March 9:  Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,  he wrote about how the US deals with the flu. The White House, though, is pushing back against the notion that Trump is at fault, reports the Washington Post.

"(Sep 6, 2016  12:28 PM CDT) Isabelle Dinoire has died 11 years after receiving a new mouth, nose, and chin in the world's first partial face transplant, the Guardian reports. She was 49. The procedure was seen as a medical breakthrough at the time, notes the AP. Dinoire died in April, but her death wasn't announced until Tuesday, as the French woman's family originally hoped to keep it private. The BBC reports Dinoire had been happy with the results of the transplant but not with the international attention it brought her. The announcement of her death mentioned only a long illness, but the BBC reports Dinoire died from cancer, to which she was vulnerable because of the immunosuppressants needed to keep her body from rejecting her new face. The Guardian reports Dinoire wanted  to forget  her problems when she took sleeping pills in 2005. When she came to, she went to light a cigarette only to discover her pet dog had chewed off her mouth and nose. She believed her dog was trying to save her. Dinoire's injuries were too severe for facial reconstruction, leading to the groundbreaking surgery.  I have a face like everyone else,  the AP quotes Dinoire as saying a year after her surgery.  A door to the future is opening.  But it wasn't easy. Getting used to the inside of a new mouth, for example.  It was soft,  the Guardian quotes Dinoire as saying.  It was horrible.  And she had lost partial use of her lips last year as her body continued to reject the new face. Nearly 40 face transplants have been performed since Dinoire's operation.

"(Dec 22, 2014  2:51 AM) Police in Australia are investigating a gruesome train accident that left a man who had been celebrating his 18th birthday clinging to life after both his legs were severed above the knee. Alcohol appears to have been a major factor: Police say that after they were called to the scene at around 4:30am Sunday, they were confronted by an angry group of people, believed to be the man's friends and relatives, who pelted them and the train's driver with rocks, forcing them to take shelter inside the train's cabin, 9News reports. Before police reinforcements arrived, paramedics who arrived to treat the teen were blocked and verbally abused and an ambulance windshield was smashed with a rock, according to police in Taree, New South Wales. The victim  didn't move at all  in the moments before he was hit by the slow-moving freight train, police say. When officers got to him,  everyone assumed that he was deceased but then he ... murmured and moved,  a police spokesman tells the Daily Telegraph.  It is a tragic and horrific incident for the young fella. He is alive, but we just hope that the medical staff or surgical guys can give him some sort of quality of life.  Police say that the angry mob delayed his treatment, but  not for too long,  and charges may be forthcoming against those who attacked police and paramedics, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The train driver, who was sent for mandatory blood and urine tests, has been offered trauma counseling.

The Hill reports that 48% of likely Alaska voters say they will cast ballots for Republican Don Young, who has served since 1973, while 49% say they will support Democrat Alyse Galvin in her bid for the state’s sole House seat; 3% are undecided.

"(Mar 11, 2015  4:17 PM CDT) Quick, where were you when you heard about the 9/11 attacks? Who were you with? If you're like most people, you've got answers at the ready. But as it turns out, there's a decent chance your answers are wrong, reports Time. That's the upshot of a new study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, which examines people's remembrances after the attacks. In the days after Sept. 11, 2001, researchers across the country asked more than 2,000 people about their personal experiences with 9/11. When researchers followed up at later intervals, about 40% of the stories—or  flashbulb memories,  as they're called in the vernacular—had changed.  Human memory is not like a computer,  says study author William Hirst of the New School for Social Research.  Human memory is extremely fallible.  One quirk: The stories tended to change fairly early, say in the first year, and then remain constant after that.  You begin to weave a very coherent story,  says Hirst.  And when you have a structured, coherent story, it’s retained for a very long period of time.  Another 9/11 study suggests that the stress of the day took a toll on the heart health of Americans, even those far removed from the attacks. Researchers in Utah discovered a spike in heart attacks in the months after 9/11, along with telltale changes in DNA strands called telomeres that are affected by stress, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. The numbers were up  significantly  when compared to the same period in other years, says a researcher at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute Genetics Lab. Adds another,  Even though we weren't participating directly in 9/11, it was a very stressful event for the entire country.  (By contrast, optimism might improve heart health.)",Your Memories of 9/11 Might Be Wrong

"(Feb 19, 2019  4:32 AM) The two brothers arrested last week in connection with the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett broke their silence with a statement Monday—but they didn't address reports that the Empire actor orchestrated the attack.  We are not racist. We are not homophobic and we are not anti-Trump,  Ola and Abel Osundairo told CBS 2.  We were born and raised in Chicago and are American citizens,  said the brothers, who were described as Nigerian in earlier reports. Smollett told police that he was attacked in Chicago last month by two men who shouted racist and homophobic insults before putting a rope around his neck and yelling:  This is MAGA country.  One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer. The brothers were released last week without being charged. Police said they provided information that changed the course of the investigation. Sources tell CBS 2 that Smollett paid the brothers $3,500 for the attack—and reimbursed them for the rope. One source says Smollett decided to orchestrate the attack because he didn't get a  bigger reaction  a week earlier when he received a letter containing a white powder—later found to be aspirin—and a threatening note in cut-out magazine letters.  When the letter didn’t get enough attention, he concocted the staged attack,  the source says. Evidence seized from the brothers' home includes a magazine and stamps. TMZ, which said Sunday that the case could be headed to a grand jury soon, reports that as suspicion Smollett staged the attack grows, his Empire screen time has been cut, with several scenes and a musical number axed from the episode currently being filmed.

She managed to escape and hide in the scrub for hours as the killer stalked her with a dog. Now, 15 years later, Joanne Lees is back in the  untamed heart of Australia  to look for Peter Falconio's body, trailed by an Aussie TV crew.  I need to bring him home,  she tells Network 9's 60 Minutes.  Pete lost his life on that night, but I lost mine, too.  Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted in 2005 of killing Falconio, 28, has never revealed what he did with Falconio's body, the Guardian reports. The vacationing couple was driving on an isolated highway at night in July 2001 when Murdoch flagged down their camper van. He shot Falconio in the head, and beat Lees, then 27, and tied her up. When Murdoch left her to check Falconio, Lees bolted. She was found on the highway with her hands bound. Her calm demeanor during questioning initially led police to consider her a suspect, per the Telegraph. Flying over the remote scene in a helicopter, Lees, now 43, tells 60 Minutes,  I know that he’s somewhere here. His spirit just feels stronger.

Germany has announced that the tens of thousands of gay men convicted under Paragraph 175 will see that conviction annulled and may receive compensation. The Guardian has a timeline of the law, which established homosexuality as a crime: Born in 1872, the law was embraced by Nazis some 50 years later; the New York Times reports 100,000 men were charged under the Nazis, with half ending up in prison and as many as 15,000 sent to concentration camps, where a pink triangle was affixed to their uniform. When the war ended, the law did not. More than 50,000 men were convicted under it between 1946 and 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized, and a few thousand more even after that in West Germany. The Nazi-era convictions were lifted at the turn of the 21st century, but there was no post-war relief until Wednesday's announcement by Justice Minister Heiko Maas, which  amounted to an apology,  reports the Times. He said in part,  Paragraph 175 was from the very beginning unconstitutional. The old convictions are unjust [and] do huge injury to the human dignity of each convicted man.  Wednesday brought one more big step forward for gays: Italy's Parliament voted 372 to 51 to recognize same-sex civil unions, reports the Times, which frames Italy as having been  perhaps the most prominent exception  among the Western nations that had already done so.","For Gay Men Who Suffered Under Paragraph 175, Justice"

Now, an arrest in a case that has been major news in the Netherlands and that involved a massive DNA undertaking. The Guardian reports that as the 20th anniversary of Nicky's death approached, Dutch officials in May 2017 put out a request: that roughly 20,000 men in the Limburg area where Nicky was killed submit their DNA that October as part of a mass testing program. More than 14,000 did, reports the BBC. Jos Brech was not among them: The NL Times reports he left in October to hike in France's Vosges mountains, reportedly telling his family he'd submit his DNA upon his return. Except he didn't return, and his family reported him missing in April. But the DNA trail still led to the 55-year-old survivalist and former scout leader. DNA that Brech's relatives provided showed the killer—who left his DNA on Nicky's pajamas—was related to one of the donors, which helped authorities zero in on Brech. They were able to recover a sample of his DNA from his home and confirmed it was a match, which earned him a spot on Europol's most wanted list last week.

"(Sep 22, 2008  3:09 PM CDT) Thomas Dörflein, the Berlin zookeeper who raised polar bear Knut after his mother rejected him, was found dead in his apartment today, Der Spiegel reports. He was 44. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play; Dörflein had been very sick. The keeper’s contact with Knut was cut off almost a year ago when the cub became too big to safely play with. Dörflein is survived by his partner and three children. He stepped in and took over care for Knut in late 2006, and spent many weeks in a cage with the cub. The two seemed to have a special bond, and became international celebrities together. Dörflein was given an award for his surrogacy last year. Police say an investigation is ongoing.",Knut's Surrogate Dad Dead at 44
"(Sep 23, 2012  5:38 AM CDT) An avalanche swept away climbers on a Himalayan peak in Nepal today, leaving at least nine dead and six others missing, officials said. A police official said the bodies of a Nepalese guide and German man were recovered and that rescue pilots have spotted seven other bodies on the slopes of Mount Manaslu in northern Nepal. The mountain is the eighth highest in the world. Ten other members of the team survived the avalanche but many were injured and are being flown to hospitals by rescue helicopters, he said. Weather conditions were deteriorating and it was not possible to continue air searches of the mountain today, said the police official. The identities of the victims were still being confirmed. The avalanche hit the climbers at a camp at 22,960 feet as they were preparing to head toward the summit, which is 26,760 feet high.

"(Jun 26, 2014  4:14 PM CDT) President Obama promised back in May to help the Syrian opposition in its fight against Bashar al-Assad, and today he made that promise a lot more tangible. The White House asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip the opposition forces, reports USA Today. With the conflict spilling over into Iraq, the White House had been under increasing pressure from critics such as John McCain to take action, notes Reuters. Recipients will be appropriately vetted  to make sure the money doesn't go to terrorists, the White House says. The money would be the biggest step taken so far by the US in the Syrian conflict, notes the New York Times, and it would be part of a broader $5 billion counterterrorism initiative for the Middle East.  While we continue to believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the United States should not put American troops into combat in Syria, this request marks another step toward helping the Syrian people defend themselves against regime attacks, push back against the growing number of extremists like ISIL who find safe haven in the chaos, and take their future into their own hands,  says a national security spokesperson. ISIL, also seen as ISIS, refers to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the group now overrunning Iraq.",White House Wants $500M for Syrian Opposition
"(Dec 14, 2010  9:07 AM) Retail sales rose for a fifth straight month in November, as the biggest jump in department store sales in two years gave the holiday shopping season a strong start. Retail sales increased 0.8% last month, the Commerce Department announced today, beating analyst predictions of a 0.5% increase, according to the Wall Street Journal. That came after a 1.7% gain in October, which was propelled by a huge increase in auto sales. Auto sales retreated a bit in November. But excluding autos, sales rose 1.2%—the best showing since last March. Department store sales jumped 2.8%, the strongest advance in two years. Analysts said that heavy holiday discounting, which started as early as October, and an improving economy were helping to boost spending. Even the weather played a part, with a November chill driving up sales of coats and other cold-weather gear.",Retail Sales Rise for 5th Straight Month
"(Feb 23, 2016  2:34 PM) Phoenix police and firefighters braved bullets and flames as they responded to a shooting and house fire that left five family members dead early Tuesday, including the gunman, authorities said. The shooter fired at officers who donned breathing gear to go into the burning home to help the victims, and some firefighters battling the blaze stood on the roof as flames gushed out, venting the home to reduce heat and improve visibility inside. Three officers were treated for smoke inhalation, the AP reports. Four people killed in the morning violence were adults, and a 6-year-old girl later died at a hospital. Police shot the gunman, police Sgt. Trent Crump said. Crump declined to release names or specify the relationships of the people involved, but he said they were a family of five and that the shooter was the brother or son of the victims. A 911 caller in the home begged for help, describing the shooting as a domestic situation. The shooter had set the house on fire; the first officers on scene went into the house because they felt they had to act quickly, Crump said. Authorities pulled two victims from the home in a cul-de-sac, then a tactical team stormed in 45 minutes later when the gunfire stopped and shot the gunman, he said. Crews extinguished after it flared up for a second time, fire Capt. Reda Riddle-Bigler said, and officials found the other victims when the flames were out. A neighbor says the 6-year-old and an older daughter lived at the home with their mother and father, and that he saw a boy in his late teens or early 20s from time to time.","Family of 5 Dead in Phoenix Shooting, Fire"

Elizabeth Warren last week, is going to have to tighten his belt a little this year: He will forfeit his bonus, part of his salary, and $41 million in stock awards over the fake-account scandal that saw the sacking of 5,300 employees, CNN reports. In addition, Stumpf will work for free while the company conducts an investigation. The bank's board of directors also says Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the retail division where workers created the phony accounts, will forfeit at least $19 million of the $125 million she was going to leave the company with at the end of the year, and will not receive severance or a bonus for 2016. The announcement comes as Wells Fargo is set to go before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers, the BBC reports. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million over the scandal and the Washington Post describes the board's cash clawback as  by far the most aggressive and public effort  since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconduct—although Stumpf still has the estimated $161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place, and Tolstedt received $60 million over the same period.

"(Aug 11, 2014  11:29 AM CDT) Three people stranded aboard a sailboat set adrift 400 miles northeast of Oahu by Hurricane Julio are awaiting rescue. A container ship reached the sailboat early this morning, but crews were waiting for conditions to improve to evacuate the trio, reports the AP.  The seas were really bad and it's kind of windy, so they didn't want to do it in the dark,  says a Coast Guard official. The 42-foot sailboat, called the Walkabout, took on water in high seas and was disabled, the Star Advertiser reports. It was initially up against winds between 92 mph and 115 mph. Following a distress call, a plane found the sailboat in a tough spot—a hatch cover and its lifeboat were blown away. Then rough seas prevented the sailboat crew from retrieving a life raft and pump dropped down to them. If all goes well, however, the container ship will lower a life raft, and the crew will float over to the rescue ship.  If seas were calm, they'd pull up to the sailing vessel and (the three sailors) would climb up what's called a Jacob's ladder,  says the Coast Guard official.  But it's really rough out there, so if (the container ship) did that, they'd end up running over that sailing vessel.",3 on Sailboat Await Rescue Near Hawaii
"(May 2, 2013  4:32 AM CDT) Things started peacefully during May Day protests in Seattle yesterday—but they didn't stay that way. Police arrested 18 people after rocks and pipes were hurled and  smoke devices  lit, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. Eight officers and at least one passerby were injured in the fray, according to reports. The day began with a largely peaceful march for immigration reform; that event saw a minor conflict with figures in costume—Phoenix Jones types, the P-I suggests. It was later that the real trouble began. An anti-capitalist march was planned to begin in the early evening; shortly after, police cited  flares or smoke devices  being used. Groups threw metal bars at store windows, cops said, and eventually police used pepper spray to  clear the streets.  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, two protest groups feuded, with some throwing flag poles and bags of urine, CNN reports. One group called itself the White Student Union; the other, the May Day Workers.

Daniel Craig will reprise his role as the super spy for the third time, going up against Javier Bardem as the villain. Skyfall’s Bond girls are French actress Berenice Marlohe and British actress Naomie Harris, Reuters reports.

"(Aug 20, 2012  10:33 AM CDT) For the first time in its 80-year history, Augusta National Golf Club has female members. The home of the Masters, under increasing criticism the last decade because of its all-male membership, invited former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore to become the first women in green jackets when the club opens for a new season in October. Both women accepted.  This is a joyous occasion,  Augusta National chairman Billy Payne said today.  I have visited Augusta National on several occasions and look forward to playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity,  said Rice, who is currently a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business and recently was appointed to the US Golf Association's nominating committee. A person with knowledge of club operations said Rice and Moore first were considered as members five years ago. Augusta National, which did not have a black member until 1990, is believed to have about 300 members.

"(Jul 7, 2010  6:12 AM CDT) An experimental solar-powered plane whose makers hope to one day circle the globe using only energy collected from the sun took off for its first 24-hour test flight today. The plane, which weighs about as much as a car but has a 262.5-foot wingspan, left Payerne airfield in Switzerland shortly before 7am after overcoming an equipment problem that delayed a previous attempt. Clear blue skies mean the prototype aircraft will be able to soak up plenty of solar energy as it flies over the Jura mountains to the west of the Swiss Alps. By midmorning pilot Andre Borschberg was cruising at 9,850 feet, trying to avoid low-level turbulence and thermal winds that are frequent in the mountains. He will take the plane to an altitude of 27,900 feet by this evening, when a decision will be made whether to continue through the night using solar power stored in its batteries. This test flight—the third major step after its first  flea hop  and an extended flight earlier this year—will demonstrate whether the ultimate plan is feasible: to fly the plane around the world.  This flight is crucial for the credibility of the project,  said team co-founder Bertrand Piccard, a record-breaking balloonist whose father and grandfather also accomplished pioneering airborne and submarine feats.",Solar Plane Attempts 24-Hour Test Flight
"(Aug 26, 2015  10:37 AM CDT) If you're stuck in traffic for a few minutes today, look on the bright side: Those few minutes are nothing compared to the 42 hours the average rush-hour commuter spent in traffic last year—or the 6.9 billion hours American drivers squandered while bumper-to-bumper—at a cost of $960 in wasted fuel. A new study from Texas A&M Transportation Institute and INRIX finds drivers are spending more time in traffic than ever before. In 2009, drivers wasted about 6.3 billion hours on the road, reports ABC News. The average delay has actually doubled since 1985 and it's only going to get worse: By 2020, the study authors predict the average driver will face 47 hours of delays for a combined 8.3 billion hours nationwide, reports USA Today. That number will probably look good to anyone who drives in Washington, DC, though. The capital had the worst traffic in the country, with drivers wasting 82 hours of their time. Los Angeles (80), San Francisco (78), New York (74), and San Jose (67) rounded out the top five. The study notes Cleveland, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Tampa fared well for their size, but Baton Rouge and Austin had worse traffic than some much larger cities. More roads can ease congestion but that strategy alone isn't enough.  This problem calls for a classic all-hands-on-deck approach,  a co-author says.  Businesses can give their employees more flexibility in where, when, and how they work, individual workers can adjust their commuting patterns, and we can have better thinking when it comes to long-term land use planning.",You Threw Away $960 Sitting in Traffic Last Year
"(Jul 5, 2012  2:29 PM CDT) After a rare surplus in 2010, last year saw the Vatican's biggest deficit in years: $19 million, the AP reports. The figure comes despite bigger donations from dioceses around the world and the Vatican bank's $62 million donation to the pope. Officials say weak markets—particularly in real estate—as well as high employee and media costs cut into the budget. The Vatican's television, radio, and newspaper organizations are expensive and bring in little. On the bright side for the Vatican, donations from believers for charity works were up, from $67.7 million in 2010 to $69.7 million in 2011. That money, however, doesn't factor into the operating budget. The Vatican city state, a separate entity, also boasted a surplus of $27 million.

The administration intends to formally notify Congress of the plan this week or next, and will tout the deal’s potential to create at least 75,000 jobs. But lawmakers could still block the sale, which would include 84 F-15 fighters and 178 helicopters. Critics complain that the deal supports a government with a weak human rights record, and could undercut Israeli security.

When the Tucson woman got a phone call on Tuesday about luggage that had turned up in the TSA's lost and found, she expected it was a follow-up regarding bags that went missing in August and had later been returned. Instead, Dellos was reunited with a bag that had mysteriously vanished two decades ago, KVOA reports. Inside was $600 worth of art supplies from a Las Vegas trade show and a handwritten note with Dellos' former address.  I was just absolutely blown away,  she says.  This is product, art product, very valuable stuff.  And it's still  very creamy and useable,  she adds. So where has it been all this time?  Items that predate our agency are interesting,  says a TSA rep, who commends Dellos for packing her items then in now-mandatory plastic baggies.  We just did some shuffling of equipment at the airport, so it's quite possible that we came across something that somebody left unattended for a long period of time.  It isn't clear which airline lost the bag. Quartz notes Envoy Air was the worst offender in 2014 with 8.82 mishandled bags per 1,000 travelers; of the 14 airlines reviewed, Virgin America fared best, at 0.97 lost bags per 1,000 fliers.

This was not 11 guys, each with different  cameras, the official says. The Navy Times notes that a ballistic missile sub like the Wyoming offers only unisex showers in  officer country.  When using the shower, a female officer must hang a sign to show it's occupied by a woman; male officers then have to wait until the sign is removed in order to enter.

Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, 45, is in jail and faces a murder charge for the shooting death of 31-year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot seemingly at random on a pedestrian pier Wednesday. Turns out US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was about to deport Lopez-Sanchez again in March, but gave him to the San Francisco County Sheriff over a drug-related warrant, says a source in federal law enforcement. That's when the story took an unexpected turn. The sheriff let Lopez-Sanchez go, saying he had already served his time for felony re-entry after deportation and had no outstanding warrants, KTVU reports. The sheriff also ignored ICE's request to detain him and send a notice before freeing Lopez-Sanchez—because city officials see  immigration detainers  as violations of the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, according to the sheriff's legal counsel. Lopez-Sanchez already has seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses, and was on probation in Texas. The sheriff  didn't even need to hold him,  the law enforcement source says.

The standard plan goes up a dollar to $14 a month, and the premium tier rises $2 to $18. The new rates are effective Thursday, the Verge reports. A spokesman said Netflix is charging more  so that we can continue to offer more variety of TV shows and films.

Shares rose 4% Thursday after the announcement, before calming down in the evening, per CNBC. Executives hinted at the increases during an earnings call with reporters this month, accepting that they could drive some customers away.

A necropsy will be performed to determine the cause of her death. Female pilot whales generally live to be about 60 in the wild, and Bubbles was believed to be the oldest of her species in a zoological park, SeaWorld said. Pilot whales, like killer whales, belong to the dolphin family and are considered highly intelligent and social, living in pods of 20 to 90. Animal activists have condemned marine parks for keeping animals that, in the wild, typically roam for thousands of miles. Bubbles was captured off the California coast in the 1960s and performed in marine park shows most of her life. She was moved to SeaWorld in 1987 when her previous park, Marineland, closed.

They earned 41 cents an hour working in a meat-processing plant and lived in a 100-year-old former school building where they  were treated like cattle—like company property,  says a witness for the prosecution. The decades-long operation ended after the Register began investigating living conditions in 2009. The company didn't have a license for disabled care, and men didn't receive disability services or health insurance.  If the eyes of Iowa saw what was happening ... the party was going to be over,  a lawyer said. The bunkhouse supervisor was accused of handcuffing one man to a bed; reports also suggested men were beaten after breaking rules. The success of the lawsuit, brought by US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of the 32 men (only workers from the plant's final two years of operation were eligible), is  a groundbreaking advancement  showing  the men have value that is equal to people without disabilities,  the witness notes.",A $240M Win for Disabled Workers 'Treated Like Cattle'
"(Dec 7, 2015  7:04 PM) Members of the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal have made a surprise return to a Paris stage during a concert by U2, less than a month after suicide bombers stormed the band's Nov. 13 gig at the Bataclan theater and killed 89 people. U2 on Monday night was playing the last of four concerts in Paris. The last two shows had been postponed when France announced a state of emergency following the attacks that killed 130 people. It was the first time the Eagles of Death Metal band had performed since the attacks, which band members escaped under harrowing circumstances. The band, though deeply shaken, has said it wanted to play again in Paris. Just before the band emerged Monday night, U2 frontman Bono said there was  nothing left except to introduce you to some people whose lives will forever be a part of this city of Paris. These are our brothers. Our fellow troubadours. They were robbed of their stage three weeks ago, and we would like to offer them ours tonight. Would you welcome the Eagles of Death Metal!  The bands then played the Patti Smith song  People Have the Power.  The Eagles of Death Metal singer then said,  We love you too, so much for giving us this opportunity.

"(Jan 30, 2017  8:33 AM) Masaya Nakamura, the  Father of Pac-Man,  who founded the Japanese video game company behind the hit creature-gobbling game, has died at age 91, the AP reports. At the time of his death on Jan. 22, Nakamura held an honorary position at Bandai Namco, formed in a 2005 merger with the pioneering company, then called Namco, he started in 1955. With humble beginnings in two mechanical horses on the rooftop of a department store, the company went on create video game arcades and amusement parks. The most successful game was Pac-Man, which went on sale in 1980. Guinness World Record has named it the world's most successful coin-operated arcade game. Designed by video game maker Toru Iwatani, the idea for Pac-Man came from the image of a pizza with a slice carved out. It launched at a time when rival games such as Space Invaders were few. Pac-Man is estimated to have been played more than 10 billion times. Nakamura reportedly chose the word  Pac  to represent the munching of the Pac-Man devouring its prey. The yellow character is iconic in Japanese culture, having inspired T-shirts and other merchandize, animation shows and the nickname for Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. Nakamura was a key player in the global growth of Bandai Namco.

"(Apr 6, 2013  5:37 AM CDT) As far as geological mysteries go, it's an intriguing one: For decades, China has reported being home to 50,000 rivers of at least about 40 square miles. But the country's three-year census of its water—a first-of-its-kind effort involving 800,000 surveyors and released last week—revealed a drastically different count. As of 2011, just 22,909, reports the Verge, which asks the million-dollar question: Why did 27,000 rivers vanish? The answer is an easy one, a census director tells the South China Morning Post: That 50,000 figure was arrived at using topographical maps as many as 60 years old, which were incomplete. The Post cited climate change and water and soil loss as well, but the Verge reports that China itself may have had a heavier hand in the decrease. It spoke with Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, who agreed that the answers offered by the government likely played a role; but he cited pollution and overpopulation as key factors. As the Verge explains, the destruction caused by flooding in the 1960s led the country to erect dams and reservoirs that reined in flooding but messed with the ecological system, causing rivers to go dry. Add in a more than fivefold surge in water use by a booming population in about the same period, along with pollution that only compounds the problem: It's  destroying the limited clean resources we have,  Ma said.",Mystery in China: 54% of Rivers Vanish

"(Jan 24, 2013  5:03 AM) The country's biggest banks have seen $114 billion leave their coffers this month, with withdrawals in the first full week of the year hitting a post-9/11 record, according to Fed data. Seasonal adjustment cuts the figure to $52.8 billion, which remains the third-highest ever recorded. Bloomberg is trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. One potential explanation: The government's Transaction Account Guarantee program, which sought to protect smaller banks from runs, ended Dec. 31. But the smaller banks lost just $26.9 billion this month—0.9% of their deposit base, compared to the 2% lost by the 25 biggest banks. Another theory, then: The records come from  a noisy database,  which is particularly  wacky  in the first quarter, says one expert, so maybe we shouldn't make much of the occurrence. After all, it's been an odd month financially, between reactions to the fiscal cliff and a payroll tax hike. It's also possible that, after a good year for the stock market, investors are feeling more comfortable exiting federally-backed accounts.

"(Jun 8, 2017  7:02 AM CDT) In April, a Michigan doctor was charged with performing genital mutilation on two young Minnesota girls. On Wednesday, feds dropped what the Detroit Free Press calls a  bombshell  in the case: They estimate not two but up to 100 girls had their genitals cut by Dr. Jumana Nagarwala.  The Minnesota victims were not the first victims,  Assistant US Attorney Sara Woodward told a judge as part of what is the first case of its kind to be prosecuted in federal court. The government says it has evidence of eight victims (though the Detroit News notes the case at hand still just involves the two). The feds arrived at their estimate based on defendant Dr. Fakhruddin Attar's alleged statement that he gave Nagarwala use of his Livonia clinic as many as six times a year over a dozen years. The allegation came as Woodward argued Attar and his wife, who is accused of helping to calm and restrain the girls during the procedure, should not be released on bail in advance of the October trial. A judge disagreed; they'll be on house arrest going forward, and barred from using the Internet. The prosecution argues the three, members of an Indian-Muslim sect called the Dawoodi Bohra, illegally cut the girls' genitals as part of a religious rite. The defense counters they simply underwent what the News terms a  benign  procedure that involved scraping the mucous membrane of the girls' genitalia; lawyers say what was removed was then deposited on gauze pads and returned to their mothers for burial.

She's a biologist in British Columbia who was willing to tolerate 180,000 bites as a host for the creatures so that her team could study them.  I calmed myself down thinking when human beings were still living in caves, they were probably bitten by bedbugs, by fleas, by mice and who knows what,  she tells the Canadian Press via CTV.  So I think humans can endure this, and I'm lucky enough that I have no side effects, that I just can handle it.  It seems her work has paid off. The researchers, including Gries' husband, found a histamine molecule that, to the bugs, indicates a  safe space,  the Press reports; once the bugs find it, they stick around. The researchers lured them to the trap using a pheromone blend and components from the bedbugs' own feces; the histamine then keeps them there. The cost of the chemicals? Less than a dime per trap.  The biggest challenge in dealing with bedbugs is to detect the infestation at an early stage,  Gries' husband tells Simon Fraser University News.  This trap will help landlords, tenants, and pest-control professionals determine whether premises have a bedbug problem, so that they can treat it quickly.  The trap should be on the market next year, CBC reports. That's particularly good news for Chicago, which was reported earlier this year to be America's worst city for bedbugs.

Pakistan, too, made mistakes, most significantly withholding information about the location of its border posts—a finding that isn't likely to sit well with Pakistan, which was enraged by the incident. US officials also contend that Pakistani forces fired first and should have known from the fighter jets and gunships that their patrol wasn't insurgents, and Pakistani officials refused to take part in the investigation.

Attorney Scott Gilbert said a company that he founded will buy 40 tons of charcoal made from the invasive woody plant marabu. The charcoal is produced by hundreds of worker-owned cooperatives across Cuba and has become an increasingly profitable export, valued for its clean-burning properties and often used in pizza and bread ovens, the AP reports.

The main problem, the report notes, is that, under current interagency watchlist policy, the TSA isn't allowed to receive every bit of terrorism-related data, meaning airlines often have to fend for themselves in determining whether a job applicant is properly vetted, including whether an applicant is lawfully allowed to work in the US and if the applicant has committed any crimes that would disqualify him from gaining unsupervised access to secure airport areas. The TSA and airports aren't permitted to conduct  recurrent criminal history vetting,  meaning the applicant would have to self-report, the DHS report notes. How the DHS conducted its analysis: The agency asked the National Counterterrorism Center to cross-reference more than 900,000 records of current aviation workers against the NCTC's terror watchlist. The list's terrorism codes associated with the 73 individuals in question were not shared with the TSA during the vetting process due to current interagency rules that prohibit such sharing, the report finds. It also notes that  thousands of records  pored over during the vetting process contained incomplete info; sometimes applications would only include an initial for a candidate's first name or would be missing a Social Security number. The workers who slipped through  were employed by major airlines, airport vendors, and other employers,  the report adds, and were cleared for access to secure areas,  despite representing a potential transportation security threat.",TSA Didn't Catch 73 Airport Workers on Terror Watchlist
"(Jun 23, 2020  11:35 AM CDT) It's an organ donor story with an unusual twist: A husband and wife ended up being donors to the same man 15 years apart, reports CBS News. The story begins in 2004, when 35-year-old Bryan Herrington died after a fall from a roof on his construction job, per CNN. His kidney and pancreas went to Florida's Jeff Granger, who eventually learned his donor's identity and struck up a friendship with Herrington's widow, Terri. Flash forward to 2019, when the kidney Granger received from Herrington began to fail. He posted about it on social media, hoping to find a donor, and he informed his friend Terri—not because he wanted her to give him a kidney but because he thought she should know.  I didn't want to call Terri but I did,  says Granger, per CBS.  I wanted her to be one of the first ones to know and she said, 'Don't worry about it. You'll get mine.'  He thought she was joking, but it turns out she was thinking about becoming a living donor and Granger's predicament cemented her decision. The successful transplant took place at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital. Now, Terri's kidney is helping keep Granger alive, as is the pancreas from her late husband.  We are back together,  she tells CNN.","Husband and Wife Save a Life, 15 Years Apart"
"(Oct 10, 2018  3:40 AM CDT) Hurricane Michael is now an  extremely dangerous  Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130mph and could become even stronger before it makes landfall in Florida's Panhandle or Big Bend area on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center warns. The center says devastating storm surges of up to 13 feet are expected to hit parts of Florida's Gulf Coast, and flash-flooding from heavy rains could hit as far north as Virginia, the Pensacola Journal reports. The storm will be the strongest to hit the US mainland so far this year, and could be the most devastating the Panhandle region has seen in decades, reports the New York Times. Tens of thousands have been ordered to evacuate amid emergency declarations in parts of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.  I guess it's the worst case scenario. I don't think anyone would have experienced this in the Panhandle,  meteorologist Ryan Maue tells the AP.  This is going to have structure damaging winds along the coast and hurricane force winds inland.  Officials say some 375,000 people along the Gulf Coast have been told to evacuate. The orders are mandatory in some places, though many people have apparently decided to stay put. Forecasters say that after it makes landfall in Florida on Wednesday afternoon, Michael is expected to move over Georgia and the Carolinas, dumping yet more rain on areas hit hard by Hurricane Florence before it moves offshore again Friday.

Ringing Bells originally said it would ship 2.5 million units of its Freedom 251 phone—a 3G Android with a 4-inch screen, 8GB of storage, an 8MP main camera, and a 3.2MP selfie camera—by the end of June, per Android Authority, but now CEO Mohit Goel tells the Indian Express that's been dropped down to 200,000 shipped out by June 30, with more soon to come. There had been much skepticism over whether the phones actually existed.  We learned from our mistakes and decided to go silent till we [came] out with the product,  Goel says.  Now we have a … dual-SIM phone ready for delivery. I feel vindicated.  Talk of the phone has raised disbelieving eyebrows since it was announced: In February, Ars Technica called the whole deal  awfully shady,  noting that initial previews of the phone showed an unattractive, cheap-looking unit that appeared to be another company's phone  rebranded  with white correcting fluid. The Guardian notes that Ringing Bells is losing about $2.20 per smartphone, but Goel tells the Express he hopes to recoup profits in volume.  We will have a loss, but I am happy that the dream of connecting rural and poor Indians as part of the 'Digital India' and 'Make in India' initiatives has been fulfilled with Freedom 251,  he says.

"(Aug 12, 2016  12:34 PM CDT) Hillary and Bill Clinton earned $10.6 million last year, according to a tax filing released by her campaign Friday that sought to pressure presidential rival Donald Trump to disclose his tax returns. The AP reports the filing shows that the Clintons paid a federal tax rate of 34.2% in 2015. The bulk of their income—more than $6 million—came from speaking fees for appearances largely made before Hillary Clinton launched her campaign last April. They gave more than $1 million to charity. The release is part of an effort to undercut Trump's character by questioning the celebrity businessman's record. Trump has refused to make his filings public. Clinton's campaign also released 10 years of of returns from running mate Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton. Over the last decade, the couple has donated 7.5% of their income to charity, the campaign said, and paid an effective tax rate of 25.6% last year.

One climber who attempted it says it's an incredibly challenging task for anyone under 5 foot 10, but this week, two female rock climbers, Michaela Kiersch and Paige Claassen, became the first women to  send  (successfully finish a route without falling or leaning on gear) the behemoth 90-foot climb—one charting in with a height of just 5 foot 6, the other at 5 foot 1, per Outside. The tinier of the two women, 23-year-old Kiersch, was the first one to earn Necessary Evil honors on Tuesday, while 27-year-old Claassen sent the route the very next day. Outside describes in detail the arduous challenges of conquering Necessary Evil, including extra-long reaches between extremely small holds, a rough rock surface that scrapes one's skin, an ear-piercing din from the trucks on the highway below, and the need for perfect weather.  It's finicky—it can't be too hot or too cold or too humid, because it will feel impossible,  says climber Alex Honnold, who has tried and failed to conquer the rock.  Unless it's too dry, then it will feel slippery.  Still, both women persevered and got their payoff.

An enormous bull elephant was killed on Oct. 8 just outside a national park by a German hunter who had paid $60,000 for a permit, the Telegraph reports. (The link has an image of the elephant.) Conservationists tell CNN that with tusks that weighed around 120 pounds each, the elephant was one of the biggest to be seen in the region for 50 years—and if it hadn't been shot, it could have become a tourist attraction worth a lot more than $60,000. The hunter, who has not been identified, was on a 21-day hunt that also included leopards, lions, buffalo, and rhinoceros, according to the Telegraph. The chairman of Zimbabwe's hunters and guides association tells the Telegraph that the elephant had not been seen in the country before and it was bigger than any of the other five or six  giant tuskers  shot over the last year. He says the client didn't realize just how big the elephant was until it was shot, and he suggests that authorities start collaring unique elephants if they don't want hunters to shoot them. Elsewhere in Zimbabwe, the bodies of 26 elephants that poachers had poisoned with cyanide were found this week, the AP reports.

But this week the full extent of her activities discovered during the state's investigation were released, and it wasn't just an occasional drug dalliance that caused her troubles: From 2005 to 2013, Farak was a heavy user of cocaine, LSD, and meth at the lab, among other drugs, and she even whipped up her own crack cocaine using lab supplies—which could call into question 30,000 cases she handled, per the New York Daily News. And throughout her entire binge, no one noticed a decline in her work, with one colleague even calling her  meticulous  and  dedicated to her work.  Farak's first experience with the lab's testing (aka  standard ) drugs was with meth, which she admitted she tried one year into her Amherst stint out of  curiosity,  per the state AG's report; she researched the drug and thought,  That's the one I am going to try if I am going to try it.

They began in late December 2003 in Canneto di Caronia, an Italian town in the north of Sicily that counted fewer than 200 residents. The first home to be struck was that of Antonino Pezzino, whose fuse box went up in flames. Days later, fire struck again: his kitchen fan, his TV. His neighbors along Via Mare were victims next, and by March 2004, at least 92 fires had been logged, reports Ariel Ramchandani in the Atavist.  It is like we are living in a microwave,  Pezzino said to a captivated press. Captivated because the fires were so weird and unexplained: Pezzino installed new electrical wiring and the fires persisted; the power was cut from the electrical plant to the homes and the fires persisted. Over more than 11,000 words, Ramchandani catalogues the appearance and disappearance of the fires—done by June 2004, back that October, done by June 2005—and the extensive efforts to find their root cause. Government investigators, engineers, chemists, physicists, and geomagnetists descended on the town. Electrical lines, the railroad, volcanic gases, and seismic activity were considered and mostly rejected. One Catholic priest claimed it was the devil. A government-formed group suspected  intense bursts of electromagnetic waves of some kind,  writes Ramchandani. Then, in July 2014, the fires came back with a vengeance.

The town's longtime lone resident, Don Sammons, is moving to Colorado to be closer to his son, notes AP.

The victims were  sedated but still aware of their surroundings  during the assaults, reports AFP. The 65-year-old fondled them and forced oral sex on them, among other things.

Europe's top court has pressured Paris into saving the Great Hamster of Alsace, an endangered rodent whose fate has drawn official attention before, the Guardian reports. In the current project, farmers will grow grains or plants amenable to the little creature (like alfalfa and wheat).  The aim is to find innovative ... practices to preserve the animal without harming farmers' activities,  said the regional council in a statement. Industrial-scale farming, suburban sprawl, and freeway projects have contributed to the hamster's dwindling population—which is now between 500 and 1,000, RT.com reports. It dipped as low as 161 in 2007, when the European Commission urged France to preserve the furball; an earlier effort in 2000 went nowhere when French farmers refused to replace maize with less profitable crops, the Guardian reports.

One of those groups was the National Organization for Women, which has not endorsed a presidential candidate since Walter Mondale ran with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.  We don't think it's much to break a glass ceiling for one woman and leave millions of women behind,  said the chair of the Feminist Majority, one of the groups that is supporting Obama. A recent poll showed that the Illinois senator holds a 5-point lead over McCain among women—although he has fallen 13 points behind among white women.

Show him the same amount of mercy he showed Eric and Cooper, and we all know how much that was—none,  Dawn Miller, mother of Eric Cooper and grandmother to 2-year-old Cooper Chen, told the court. Chen, who said the cough medicine caused depression, paranoia, and a psychotic break, received the maximum sentence allowed in the state of Washington, reports the Seattle Times.  We believe it is a reasonable sentence for the taking of two lives in the most horrific way possible,  the senior deputy prosecutor says. Chen, an immigrant from Taiwan, met Cooper 12 years earlier, when he was in his late 20s and Cooper was a 17-year-old senior in high school. They had their son using Chen's sperm, a Taiwanese woman's egg, and a surrogate friend. They'd just moved to Seattle from North Carolina after Chen accepted a job at Virginia Mason Medical Center.

"(Dec 23, 2016  5:50 PM) Twenty-five bipartisan members of Congress say if it's from soybeans, almonds, or rice, it should not be labeled as milk. Vermont Rep. Peter Welch and Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, leading the charge against  fake milk,  signed a letter along with other Congressional members, asking the FDA to investigate and take action against manufacturers of  milk  that doesn't come from cows. The AP reports they want the FDA to require plant-based products to adopt a more appropriate name, other than milk, which they say is deceptive.  We strongly believe that the use of the term 'milk' by manufacturers of plant-based products is misleading to consumers, harmful to the dairy industry, and a violation of milk's standard of identity,  the letter states. Dairy farmers are struggling with  deep cuts in income  following a 40% drop in milk prices since 2014, the members of Congress say. The forecast is for prices to remain low. The sale of plant-based products, often labeled as milk, has jumped in recent years, the letter states. They say milk has a clear standard of identity:  obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows,  among other qualities.  While consumers are entitled to choose imitation products, it is misleading and illegal for manufacturers of these items to profit from the 'milk' name,  the letter states. The Soyfoods Association of North America said the term  soymilk  has been used on products for over 100 years. It asked the FDA in 1997 to recognize the one-word name  soymilk  but that the FDA has not made a decision on the petition.",25 Lawmakers Question Plant-Based 'Milk' Label

The agreement—which has grown from an estimated $1.2 billion to $3 billion—was originally struck by the Saddam Hussein government in 1997, to take effect once UN sanctions on Iraq's oil industry were lifted. The old contract gave a subsidiary of China's state-owned oil company concessions to develop the field on a production-sharing basis for 22 years. The new agreement, which has to be approved by the two governments, will be a service contract, under which China won't be a partner in profits and instead will be paid for its work.",China Makes $3B Deal to Develop Iraqi Oil
"(Jun 26, 2019  8:11 AM CDT) Two NOAA scientists were asked why the federal government waited 14 years to conduct a study of an oil spill that started in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. They didn't know, reports the Washington Post, but as the ones asked to do the study they could put a figure on what's still pouring out of the site all this time later: as many as 4,578 gallons daily. The oil platform was located in an underwater canyon some 12 miles from Louisiana and leased by the Taylor Energy Company—which claims just 3 gallons are seeping out daily. Monster waves churned up by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, triggered an undersea mudslide that took down the platform and more than two dozen well pipes, which were buried in more than 100 feet of sediment. Taylor Energy claims the oil is seeping out of the oil-soaked sediment. The report commissioned by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement found the oil is coming from a number of wells. The AP explains nine wells were capped by Taylor Energy, but the company has maintained it's more environmentally prudent to leave 16 of them buried than try to cap them. Gizmodo puts the new numbers in context, reporting they make for a cumulative spill of 25 million gallons; the Deepwater Horizon Spill was more than six times bigger, at 168 million gallons. The Weather Channel reports news of the former spill only publicly emerged in 2010, as scientists discovered it while looking into the latter spill; no coastal environmental damage has been reported. The researchers relied on sonar and a newly developed  bubblometer  to measure the leakage. (Taylor Energy is fighting a federal order to stop that leakage.)",The Oil Started Spilling in 2004.

Baby Joey —hospitalized weeks earlier with bruises to his face and dog bites on his ears—was pronounced dead of a laceration to his liver caused by blunt force trauma to the stomach. Warwick was accused of beating the boy and charged with murder, but the case was dismissed in 1974 for reasons that remain unclear. However, a court note made reference to Warwick having an eye disease that made him blind, reports the Belleville News-Democrat. One problem with that: He's not blind, and in fact went on to coach high school softball, notes the newspaper.

So much that the Federal Trade Commission has gotten more than 2,046 complaints about the company since 2008, the Wall Street Journal reports. Most are from small businesses saying they've been hit with unfair or fraudulent reviews—sometimes right after declining to advertise on the site. (Yelp denies that advertising has any impact on reviews.) A 1996 law protects Yelp and similar sites from lawsuits based on user reviews, but does not protect the users themselves, and Yelp says it gets about six subpoenas a month, many of them seeking reviewers' real names so businesses can sue. This month, Virginia's Supreme Court will rule on whether Yelp has to give up those names, thanks to a lawsuit from the owner of a carpet cleaning service, who says his annual sales fell $2.5 million after a spate of bad Yelp reviews that he couldn't match to actual customers.

Mastini, 60, who  terrorized Rome,  per the Guardian, in the 1970s and 1980s, was on day release from a high-security Italian prison and failed to return at the appointed time Sunday. Mastini, who was sentenced to life behind bars in 1989, previously fled during day release in 2017, 2014, and 1987.

Skylar Mack, 18, pleaded guilty to breaking quarantine to watch her boyfriend, Vanjae Ramgeet, a professional jet ski racer from the Cayman Islands, compete at an event late last month, per People. Mack reportedly arrived in the Caymans on Nov. 27 and was required to quarantine for 14 days. Two days later, however, she removed a tracking bracelet and left her residence to attend Ramgeet's event. The boyfriend, 24, was charged with aiding and abetting Mack. He also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in prison. The couple's lawyer, Jonathon Hughes, tells the AP that he will appeal the sentence next week.  They're two young people who have never been in trouble before,  he said.  This is the first time they've had interaction with police, the courts, prison.  Initially, a judge in the British territory sentenced the pair to 40 hours of community service, a $4,400 fine, and a two-month curfew for Ramgeet. A higher court, however, sided with prosecutors who said the sentence was too lenient and imposed the harsher punishment.

"(Jul 18, 2019  3:40 AM CDT) New Jersey's Supreme Court has dealt with two judges amid widespread outrage over remarks they made while overseeing rape cases. The court said Wednesday that it is ending the service of Monmouth County Superior Court Judge James Troiano at his request, NJ.com reports. Protesters called for Troiano's removal after he argued that a 16-year-old accused of rape should not be tried as an adult because he comes from a  good family.  An appellate court reversed his decision last month and rebuked him for his remarks. The state Supreme Court also announced Wednesday that Ocean County Superior Court Judge John Russo Jr., who asked a victim if she had closed her legs to avoid being raped, is being suspended without pay effective immediately; proceedings to remove him have begun. The state's top court also announced a new program to further train judges in areas including sexual assault and domestic violence, the New York Times reports. Courts are expected to recess in the next 90 days for the first annual full-day training session to help judges deliver decisions that are  rooted in the law, respectful of victims, and understandable to the public while protecting the rights of the accused,  a court spokesman said. NJ Gov. Philip Murphy praised the court's actions.  Unfortunately, the inexcusable actions of several judges over recent months have threatened this reputation for thoughtful and reasoned opinion, and common decency,  he said.  I am gratified that Judge Troiano will no longer sit on the bench and that removal proceedings will begin against Judge Russo.",2 NJ Judges Are Out After Controversial Rape Comments
"(Sep 18, 2016  11:32 AM CDT) The latest salvo in the ongoing sex scandal involving multiple Bay Area police officers was a one-two punch on Friday, reports NBC News. Just hours after two cops became the first to be charged in the scandal, the 19-year-old woman who says that she had sexual contact with dozens of cops—including some while she was a minor—filed a $66 million claim against the city of Oakland. Per the claim, members of the Oakland Police Department  continued to exploit her by trading money, information, and/or protection for sex. Instead of helping (her) find a way out of exploitation, they furthered and deepened her spiral down into the sex trade.  The lawsuit contends that  these acts constitute unlawful forced labor,  and that cops involved  either directly engaged in, stood by with a blind eye, or acted to cover up this modern-day slavery.  Cops LeRoy Johnson, who is retired, and Daniel Black were charged; the latter allegedly took the woman to dinner twice before engaging in sexual activity, telling her,  Just to be clear, I'm not paying you, but I will buy you dinner.  Charges are reportedly coming for five other officers. The woman returned to California this week from Florida, where she underwent drug rehab, notes the East Bay Times; while there, she was jailed after biting a rehab center employee. The Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who has cycled rapidly through police chiefs in the mess, had no comment on pending litigation.",Teen Sues Oakland for $66M in Police Sex Scandal

Nick Sweeting says he worked up securityequifax2017.com (a flip of the company's equifaxsecurity2017.com) to expose how easy it would be for phishers to make a copycat site.  Their site is dangerously easy to impersonate,  he says. Sweeting took pics of some of the now-deleted Equifax tweets, which started around Sept. 9 and went through at least Sept. 19, per Gizmodo. The company's critical error, per cybersecurity experts who spoke to the Times: It created an entirely new site instead of a subdomain of Equifax.com, making the company's site more vulnerable to phishing. Sweeting, who explains he was able to easily download the contents of Equifax's site using a Linux command, says his site got about 2,000 hits before getting the Twitter push, though he adds he built the site to not store consumer info, per CNN. He also made sure there was a large headline on the site alerting everyone it was fake. He says it cost him just $10 and 20 minutes of his time to create it. As for the person named  Tim  who tweeted out the wrong URL (who Sweeting thinks probably just Googled for the site address and picked up the wrong one), Sweeting doesn't think he should be harshly disciplined:  The real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.

In a blog post, CEO Wade Foster offers a $10,000  de-location  package to new recruits who are struggling with the cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has some of the country's highest rents, but are worried about moving away because they don't want to give up tech career opportunities, ABC7 reports.

"(Nov 12, 2018  3:00 PM) A Washington think tank released a report Monday identifying more than a dozen hidden missile bases North Korea has kept up and running even as President Trump touts his work on denuclearization with Kim Jong Un. The Center for Strategic and International Studies says it suspects North Korea has 20 missile operating bases that are undeclared by the government, and it has located 13 of them. The New York Times says the revelation  suggests a great deception,  with Pyongyang quietly continuing its ballistic missile program and even making improvements at these secret sites while publicly declaring its intention to dismantle its main missile launch site. Fox News notes that the report comes as denuclearization talks between the US and North Korea have stalled—Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned meeting with his North Korean counterpart last week was delayed indefinitely.  What everybody is worried about is that Trump is going to accept a bad deal—they give us a single test site and dismantle a few other things, and in return they get a peace agreement  that formally ends the Korean War, says the North Korea expert who leads the CSIS' Beyond Parallel program, which released the report. Another expert on nuclear nonproliferation called the program's analysis  excellent  but disagreed with the Times' assessment of the situation, noting on Twitter:  To call this a 'deception' is deeply misleading. Kim Jong Un publicly stated that North Korea would shift to the mass producing nuclear weapons in 2018. These bases and their missiles are well-known, long-standing and have never been offered for dismantlement by the DPRK.

"(Jul 24, 2018  2:32 PM CDT) The 2015 deaths of two firefighters were caused by a woman who set fire to her own nail salon, and not for the first time, a judge ruled Monday. Thu Hong Nguyen was found guilty of two counts each of first-degree arson, second-degree murder, and second-degree assault after using flammable liquid, possibly acetone, to start a fire in the storeroom of Kansas City's LN Nails and Spa on Oct. 12, 2015. More than 100 firefighters responded as the three-alarm blaze ripped through a three-story building. Among them, John Mesh and Larry Leggio were killed when a brick wall collapsed. Two others were seriously injured. The Kansas City Star reports that the second arson count was over a 2013 fire set at a nail salon Nguyen previously operated. She afterward collected $50,000 in insurance money, per KCTV. In fact, prosecutors said each of five nail salons Nguyen operated in Texas and Missouri since 2006 were closed after a fire or burglary, leading to four insurance payouts. Each was for more than the purchase price of the business, per the Star. An auditor with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Nguyen received more than $250,000 in business and personal insurance payouts over a dozen years. After her arrest, Nguyen—who faces up to 30 years in prison at her Sept. 14 sentencing—reportedly admitted to a fellow inmate that she'd set the latest fire but didn't mean for anyone to die.

According to the BBC, the 17-year-old had an incurable disease, was in  unbearable physical pain,  and requested euthanasia, as the law requires;  palliative sedation  was employed. No other information was provided, and Deutsche Welle reports the records outlining the patient's condition and the deliberation of the panel of physicians who weigh in are generally sealed. The teen's death, which had occurred in the past week, was announced Saturday, Reuters reports.

It expanded its euthanasia law to cover all children under the age of 18 in 2014. In order to be euthanized, children must be able to understand what it means and get consent from their parent or guardian and  death must be expected in the near future.  Belgium is the only country in the world that allows euthanasia without age restriction, and a study published this month found 1,807 total euthanasia deaths were reported in 2013, up nearly eight-fold from 235 in 2003.

"(Oct 19, 2018  12:23 PM CDT) If it seems like lottery jackpots are getting larger and larger, it's because they are. Friday night's Mega Millions grand prize has hit a staggering $1 billion, continuing a trend of giant jackpots. It's the second-largest lottery prize in US history and joins five other top 10 drawings in the last three years, per the AP. Lottery officials changed the odds in recent years to lessen the chance of winning a jackpot, which increased the opportunity for top prizes to reach stratospheric levels. The theory: Bigger jackpots would draw more attention, leading more players to plop down $2 for a Mega Millions or Powerball ticket. The more tickets sold, the more the jackpots grow, leading to more players and so on. Powerball first tried the theory in October 2015, when it changed the potential number combinations, and states have reported boosted Mega Millions and Powerball sales since. But the ever-increasing jackpots have left them ever-more dependent on those massive payouts because prizes that once seemed immense (like the current $430 million Powerball jackpot) now seem almost puny in comparison. If you do win big Friday night, don't count on a deposit anywhere close to $1 billion. Nearly all winners take the cash option, about $548 million as of Friday morning. After federal taxes and state deductions, which vary in the US, winners will generally end up with around half that amount.

"(Dec 16, 2016  10:35 AM) The 3.5-second symphony covers nearly half of the sound range that humans can hear, rising from a frequency as low as 38 hertz to an 8,000-hertz  metallic finale.  But unless you make a detour to waters above the deepest spot in the ocean, you might never hear it. Initially stumped by the  Western Pacific Biotwang —recorded above the deepest known part of Earth's oceans, the Mariana Trench—scientists now believe the noise comes from a species of baleen whale called minke whales. Minke whales are found in the area, but little is known about their vocalizations as the species  doesn't spend much time at the surface, has an inconspicuous blow, and often lives in areas where high seas make sighting difficult,  researcher Sharon Nieukirk tells Live Science. However, it is known that minke whales  call frequently,  says Nieukirk, and acoustic robots recorded the Western Pacific Biotwang on several occasions between the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015.  It's very distinct, with all these crazy parts,  Nieukirk says in a statement.  The low-frequency moaning part is typical of baleen whales, and it's that kind of twangy sound that makes it really unique.  If the sound is confirmed to come from a baleen whale, it would be significant as identifying a new baleen-whale call is a rare occurrence. It's unclear what the call might mean—a mating call would only be heard seasonally—but researchers plan to collect biopsy samples to learn more, reports the Christian Science Monitor.

Justin and Jeremiah Raisen say they were working with Lizzo on the song  Healthy  in April 2017 when someone pulled up a meme reading,  I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that bitch,  and Jeremiah suggested the line be used in the song. Five months later, the brothers say they were shocked to find a similar line,  I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch,  in  Truth Hurts,  which is credited to Lizzo (Melissa Jefferson), Ricky Reed, Tele, and Jesse Saint John.  There was a bittersweet emotion, because deep in our hearts we know that we were a part of this song,  Jeremiah tells the Times. The brothers have each sought 5% of the songwriting royalties, though their claim could go deeper as Lizzo has applied to trademark the phrase  100% That Bitch.  A lawyer for the singer, however, says the brothers  did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.  The Times reports they rescinded an earlier claim to  Truth Hurts  through their publisher, Kobalt. Still, they cite a musicologist as saying the song  would not exist in its present form without the existence of and the borrowing from 'Healthy.'  The singer whose tweet inspired the meme has also complained about a lack of credit, per Rolling Stone.",Lizzo's No. 1 Anthem Hit With Plagiarism Claim
"(Jan 20, 2009  7:16 AM) Fiat arranged a no-cash deal with Chrysler today that could put the Italian automaker behind the wheel of Chrysler’s operations, the Wall Street Journal reports. Fiat will take a 35% stake in Chrysler with an option for 20% more. Fiat will receive a foothold in the US market, retooling a Chrysler plant to produce its smaller, fuel-efficient cars. Chrysler will get to stick around a while longer. Chrysler, which already received $4 billion in federal bailout funds, must show a path to viability by March to keep those funds and receive $3 billion more. The partnership will provide both companies with economies of scale and global reach, allowing them to compete with rivals like General Motors and Toyota that each have sold more than 9 million cars annually. Chrysler sold 2 million cars last year, Fiat 2.5 million.","Fiat to Take 35% Stake in Chrysler, Enter US Market"
"(May 16, 2018  8:23 AM CDT) The school resource officer widely criticized for his response to the Feb. 14 Parkland shooting is now the target of abuse over his six-figure pension. Scot Peterson, 55, who retired a week after 17 people died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as he stood outside, began receiving a monthly state pension of $8,702.35 in April, reports the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Over a year, the payments add up to $104,428.20, a few thousand dollars more than Peterson made in his last of 32 years as a Broward County sheriff's deputy, per the Miami Herald.  This guy is a disgrace,  says Andrew Pollack, who's suing Peterson over his daughter's death in the shooting.  This infuriates me in ways people cannot comprehend,  adds Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was also killed. She  would still be alive if this person did his job.  Peterson, who is to receive the payments until his death, has claimed he took up a  tactical position  outside the school, believing the shots weren't originating inside. However, he's heard on a recording identifying shots as coming from a school building. The police response to the shooting is under review by a state commission, but a March letter from Florida's Department of Management Services notes the sheriff's office and state attorney haven't indicated  any charges or other circumstances  to warrant withholding the pension payments. They do not account for health benefits and are based on years worked and the average of Peterson's five highest-paid fiscal years, per the Sun Sentinel. Records show Peterson earned a base salary of $75,673.72 last year. With overtime and other compensation, his earnings totaled $101,879.03.",Parkland School Officer Getting 6-Figure Pension

"(Dec 19, 2013  11:24 AM) A bankruptcy judge ruled this week that Casey Anthony doesn't need to pay most of her $792,000 in debts, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Anthony filed for bankruptcy in January; most of the debts are to Jose Baez, her defense attorney in her murder trial. But the case is not yet closed, and it's not clear how much (if any) money Anthony will have to pay, the Sentinel notes; the judge's order simply does away with Anthony's legal obligation to pay most of the debts, but could leave her still responsible for certain debts including any related to taxes, student loans, or fines in criminal cases. One thing that means: Taxpayers will likely end up footing the almost $200,000 bill related to what law enforcement agencies spent searching for Anthony's murdered daughter Caylee, which Anthony was originally ordered to pay back after she was convicted of lying to investigators, WFTV reports. But, a legal analyst says, it's likely Anthony will at least have to pay more than $80,000 in federal income taxes on the $200,000 she got for selling pictures and videos of Caylee to ABC Television.","Casey Anthony $792K in Debt, but Won't Have to Pay"
"(May 21, 2015  4:17 PM CDT) The Wall Street Journal relays progress on one of the strangest and slowest-moving border issues you'll ever encounter. It seems that the Czech Republic owes Poland 909 acres, or 1.42 square miles, and plans to pay up. The land debt goes back to the late 1950s, when the Soviets ordered the two countries to straighten the border between them to make it easier to patrol, reports the Journal. They did so, but Poland got the short end of the stick. The demise of the USSR raised the issue anew in the 1990s, and the two countries have been trying to hammer out a resolution since. They can't revert to the old borders because things have changed too much—roads, buildings, farms—so the Czechs have agreed to carve out 909 acres and give them to Poland. One example of the weird complications: A Czech farmer may have to stop using one of his barn doors in order to keep his cows in the right country. At this point, the best-case estimate for a resolution is 2020. See the full story.",Czechs to Give Back 1.42 Square Miles to Poland

"(Apr 22, 2015  7:08 PM CDT) A federal judge has approved a settlement agreement that is expected to cost the NFL $1 billion over 65 years to resolve thousands of concussion lawsuits. NFL actuaries project about 6,000 of the league's nearly 20,000 retired players could someday develop Alzheimer's or moderate dementia over the life of the deal approved today by a federal judge in Philadelphia. The average individual award would be about $190,000. Awards could reach $1 million to $5 million for those diagnosed in their 30s and 40s with Parkinson's disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, or for deaths involving chronic brain trauma. The benefits process could start this summer, but any appeal would delay all payments indefinitely.  What matters now is time, and many retired players do not have much left,  said plaintiff Kevin Turner, a former New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles running back who has Lou Gehrig's disease. The league has been dogged for years by complaints that it long hid the risks of repeated concussions to return players to the field. Senior US District Judge Anita Brody approved the settlement after twice sending it back to lawyers over concerns the fund might run out. The negotiators did not increase the original $765 million plan, but agreed to remove that number as the cap. The settlement approval, a week before the NFL draft, ends a nearly four-year legal fight.

"(Jul 19, 2016  6:35 PM CDT) Back in 2009, a materials science professor and his students were, in a sense, playing with fire in a lab at Oregon State University—well, mixing chemicals and heating them to temperatures above 2,000 degrees anyway—when they accidentally created a new blue. The happy accident occurred during an attempt to create new materials for use in electronics when a grad student extracted a mix from the furnace and saw a brilliant blue.  You know what Louis Pasteur said?  the professor, Mas Subramanian, recently asked NPR.  Luck favors the alert mind.  The group was lucky indeed, because the blue is the first to be discovered in two centuries. The team named the blue YInMn for the elements it comprises—yttrium, indium and manganese—and it has just become commercially available as paint via the Ohio-based Shepherd Color Company, reports Quartz. Scientists also are working on an energy-saving roofing material with YInMn because the compound can resist water and sunlight better than other blues, including the last one created, cobalt blue. Expect to see it in plastics, too. Subramanian and his team also are developing other colors using YInMn, which is, as New York describes it,  part neon-blue and two parts Cookie Monster.  Meanwhile, Artnet reports that YInMn has been entered in a Harvard Art Museum pigment collection that preserves the  world history of color,  while artists are calling the color  Mas Blue —mas means  more  in Spanish and happens to be Subramanian's name.  The more we discover about the pigment, the more interesting it gets,  he says. (See how the world's ugliest color is being used to save lives.)",Chemists Stumble on First New Blue in 200 Years
"(Dec 21, 2013  8:47 AM) It's not your usual message-in-a-bottle story, but maybe more fascinating for just that reason. Two researchers in the remote Canadian Arctic found the bottle tucked into a mound of rocks on Ward Hunt Island, reports Popular Science. The note inside had a simple request: Measure the distance from the rocks to a nearby ice shelf, and then report back either to the note writer or to a colleague in Boston, reports the Halifax Chronicle Herald. It had names and addresses for both and was dated July 10, 1959. The modern-day researchers conducted the measurement and found that the ice sheet had retreated more than 200 feet since 1959, one tells the LA Times. But the story is about more than that particular scientific experiment. It turns out that the note writer was then-25-year-old Paul Walker and the colleague he mentioned was Albert Crary, both of whom are now renowned in polar research.  I recognized the two names instantly,  says one of the two who found it. (He mentions  goose bumps. ) Part of the fascination is that Walker suffered a stroke just weeks after writing the note and died later that same year.  I was just so pleased because it brought Paul back, in a way, and the work he had done,  says a historian who knew him.  He had a brilliant career as a glaciologist and all of a sudden, to be cut short that way.  And the finale: The two present-day researchers took photos of the note but put it back where they found it, along with another from themselves asking future researchers to conduct the same measurement, reports the CBC.

The loophole enabled Nabors Industries, an oil-drilling firm whose CEO pledged $1 million to the project, to maintain an offshore tax shelter. Rangel, who is facing a House ethics committee probe, said he helped keep the loophole open as a longtime opponent of retroactive tax increases. Nabors' CEO Eugene Isenberg said,  There was no quid pro quo  and that he had donated for the sake of the public policy school at New York’s City College.

Going that route then leaves the door open for the male to make a decision of his own  when he has come of age,  says Lise Moller, the head of the association’s ethics board. That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local.

The company ordered the suspension of sales Tuesday on the recommendation of South Korean safety officials, who say they suspect a new defect in the replacement phones that may not be related to its batteries.  We would have not taken this measure if it had looked like the problems could be easily resolved,  Oh Yu-cheon, a senior official at the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, tells the AP. The agency, which oversees recalls, is urging consumers not to use the phones. Last month, Samsung issued a global recall. It blamed a tiny manufacturing error in the battery that it said made the phones prone to catch fire. Oh says the investigators are studying a different defect from the one Samsung said it had found in the first batch of Galaxy Note 7's.  The improved product does not have the same defect. That's why we think there is a new defect,  he says. Samsung says consumers with original Note 7 devices or replacements they obtained after the recall should turn them off and seek a refund or exchange them for different phones.",Samsung: Stop Using 'Improved' Galaxy Note 7
"(Feb 16, 2020  11:15 AM) Six mass graves containing more than 6,000 bodies—and thousands of bullets—have been uncovered in Burundi. It's the largest discovery of victims since the nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commission began a nationwide excavation last month, Reuters reports. The commission was launched in 2014 to examine atrocities from the time foreigners arrived in the East African nation in 1885 until 2008, when an agreement ending the nation's civil war took effect. About 300,000 people were killed in the civil war. That history includes sporadic massacres, often targeting ethnic groups. The commission has counted more than 142,000 victims of violence and documented more than 4,000 mass graves. In the latest discovery, some victims were identified by their clothes, eyeglasses or rosaries, the commission president said. The United Nations is concerned that human rights abuses could increase ahead of the national elections in May. Security forces have killed hundreds of people in confrontations since 2015, when Pierre Nkurunziza ran for president unopposed, per Reuters. Most of his tenure is not covered by the commission's investigation; he took office in 2005.","Newly Found Mass Graves Hold 6,000 Victims in Burundi"

"(Dec 9, 2013  7:00 PM) America's most famous one-armed hiker skirted an assault charge today but his girlfriend wasn't quite so lucky, the Denver Post reports. Ralston and girlfriend Vita Shannon, both 38, were arrested Saturday night in Denver and each charged with one count of assault and one count of wrongs to minors. A judge dismissed charges against Ralston, while Shannon pleaded not guilty to both charges and a new charge of disturbing the peace. She could spend up to a year in prison and pay $999 for each charge if convicted, a prosecutor said. According to police, Ralston said they argued and Shannon hit him with her fists twice in the back of the head; Shannon contends Ralston shoved her shoulder as he left her house. Their 2-month-old daughter was present, which explains the  wrongs to minors  charge—which is leveled when children are there but unhurt in a domestic incident.  This is just two people trying to work out a difficult relationship,  said Ralston's father. Ralston's experience trapped in a Utah canyon—and his teeth-gritting decision to escape by severing his own arm—was dramatized in the film 127 Hours.","127 Hours Hiker Walks, Gal Charged With Assault"
"(Jun 1, 2018  12:30 PM CDT) It took some time for the din from March's Bachelor finale—after Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped the girl he initially chose, Becca Kufrin, and got engaged to runner-up Lauren Burnham—to subside. Now, however, thanks to Kufrin's stint as the current Bachelorette and a new profile on Luyendyk in GQ,  the most hated bachelor in America  is back in the spotlight. Rebecca Nelson spent two days in Scottsdale, Ariz., with the 36-year-old and Burnham, a  reserved  26-year-old, and Luyendyk insists he was made into a villain by the crew and feels  100%  betrayed. He's especially irked about the supposedly unedited footage of his breakup with Kufrin, which he says was more staged than suggested. Viewers had raged that Luyendyk wouldn't leave after Kufrin told him to.  It was completely edited,  he says.  I was told to stay on that couch. I tried to leave, and then production was like, 'You need to go back inside.'  Still, Luyendyk understands the producers' role ( it's their job to make it entertaining for people ), and the rest of Nelson's stay involved tagging along with the couple as they went house hunting, hearing about how Luyendyk ended up on the show in the first place in 2011—he was a fill-in for a last-minute dropout—and learning about Luyendyk's thought process as he struggled to choose between two women. Nelson's visit with the couple didn't end on a great note: After a one-on-one with Burnham in which Nelson revealed to Burnham (who hadn't watched the finale) about a comment Kufrin had made about how she'd  challenge [Luyendyk] a lot more  than Burnham, Nelson got a text from Luyendyk.

"(Oct 9, 2014  9:46 AM CDT) The body of one passenger of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was found wearing an oxygen mask, Dutch prosecutors revealed today, raising questions about how much those on board knew about their fate when the plane plunged out of the sky above Eastern Ukraine in July. The passenger, an Australian, didn't have the mask on his face, but its elastic strap was around his neck, says a rep for the Dutch National Prosecutor's Office, which is carrying out a criminal investigation into the air disaster. He adds that Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask  for fingerprints, saliva, and DNA and that did not produce any results. So it is not known how or when that mask got around the neck of the victim.  The rep says no other bodies recovered from the wreckage were found wearing masks. All 298 passengers and crew died when the jet flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed July 17. Dutch investigators said last month it was likely struck by multiple  high-energy objects.  Relatives of the Australian passenger were told about the mask as soon as it was discovered, but relatives of other victims heard about it for the first time when Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans mentioned it on a late-night talk show yesterday.

"(Apr 6, 2017  7:45 PM CDT) It took hours, but a 30-year-old female hiker was rescued Wednesday afternoon after being hit and pinned by a 1,500-pound rock at North Table Mountain Park in Golden, Colo. The woman and a male companion were hiking to an area where they were going to mountain climb when the man heard  a large crack,  a spokesperson for the Golden Fire Department tells the Denver Post. He looked up and saw the boulder start to fall from 30 feet above;  it just barely missed him,  the spokesperson says. The rock, which was about 5 feet by 4 feet, per the Golden Transcript, was moving too fast for the woman to get out of the way, struck her, and pinned her legs underneath it. About 10 emergency agencies were involved in the rescue; rescue crews and ATVs had to hike a hydraulic system and airbags to the woman, who was about an hour from the trailhead. It took more than two hours to free her, and then rescuers carried her 45 minutes to a helicopter at the top of the mountain that took her to the hospital. Though she was critically injured—she had multiple fractures and was unconscious during the rescue—the fire department says her vital signs were  fairly good.  As the Post explains, rockslides are a fairly typical occurrence during the temperature changes involved in the freeze-thaw cycle in the spring.

He'll be sentenced on Feb. 15, and faces up to 11 years in juvenile detention, the Press-Enterprise reports. He was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors argued that the killing was cold and premeditated—the boy's sister testified that he told her he intended to kill Hall days before he did so. The defense initially entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, but later withdrew it, arguing that the boy had been abused, and raised in a violent home where killing was deemed acceptable. Both sides agreed his father's National Socialist Movement ties weren't a motivating factor. Instead, the boy said he was mad at Hall for spanking and kicking him, and worried he'd leave the family for another woman, separating him from his stepmother.",12-Year-Old Convicted for Murder of Neo-Nazi Dad

"(Apr 25, 2017  2:04 PM CDT) A nearly 500-pound bell has been returned to Colorado State University after being stolen a century ago. And it's got quite the tale to tell.  The story of the bell really blew our minds,  the president of Associated Students of CSU tells the Denver Post. The university got the bell in 1910—it was built in 1894—and installed it in Old Main, the oldest building on campus. Students would ring the bell for the start of classes and after football victories. The bell's clapper was stolen—possibly by neighbors tired of students clanging it throughout the night—and resourceful students resorted to ringing it by sledgehammer, the Coloradoan reports. The bell itself was stolen by an unknown group of students in 1919 and buried at a nearby farm. By the 1970s—the Rocky Mountain Collegian reports—Old Main had burned down during student protests, the bell had been dug up and relocated to an unknown fraternity, and most people had forgotten it even existed. At some point the bell was mysteriously moved out of Colorado. Last year, the executive director of the CSU alumni association received a call from a lawyer asking if the university would be interested in getting the bell back. She said yes, and the bell materialized outside her house while she was taking her kids to basketball practice. Whoever had the bell apparently thought the opening of a new CSU football stadium was the right time to return it. The restored bell will be installed at the university's new alumni center and ring once again next year.

"(Nov 17, 2014  6:52 AM) Each day, more than 3,000 children under age 5 die from preterm birth complications—meaning that, for the first time ever, premature birth is the biggest killer of young children around the globe. A new study in the Lancet finds that of the 1.1 million such deaths in 2013, 965,000 of them were a direct result of being born too early, with the child dying within 28 days of birth. But another 125,000 deaths happened between the age of 1 month and 5 years, according to a press release. Meanwhile, the overall mortality rate for children under 5 has declined since 2000, as vaccines, antibiotics, and other advances have reduced deaths from pneumonia, measles, and other causes.  The success we've seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth,  says a researcher. The first step, which is already underway with $250 million in new funding: Figure out what causes preterm births. Obesity, high blood pressure, and later-in-life motherhood are all risk factors, but the exact trigger for premature labor remains a  mystery,  the Telegraph reports. The countries most affected are often poor: India has the highest number of deaths from preterm birth complications, followed by Nigeria and Pakistan. But even in the US, 28% of under-5 deaths are caused by such complications, which is above the global average of 17.4%; the US has  one of the worst preterm birth rates of any high-resource country,  the press release notes. Among the new research initiatives: identifying the electric signals that trigger labor and figuring out whether that process is initiated by the mother or the fetus.

She receives financial support from her legal team, the sources say, but she  lives like an old person on a fixed income,  resorting to staging paparazzi shots and trying to sell them to the media when she runs low on cash.

"(Jan 20, 2014  7:30 PM) Hoping to attend Super Bowl XLVIII? No problem: All you need is around $2,700 bucks (for the worst possible seat, mind you) and the patience to navigate public transit (as driving/parking will be a nightmare). In case you're rich, the NFL's official used-ticket marketplace is selling front-row, 50-yard-line seats for $50,000, the Atlantic Wire reports. Or you could pool for a luxury suite—for a cool $1 million. The NFL said it raised ticket prices because A) New Yorkers are loaded and B) scalpers had been raising ticket prices so much, the Wall Street Journal reports. As for transportation, the NFL wants everyone to take buses and trains to the game, the New York Times reports.  This is going to be a national experiment,  said a transportation expert in New York.  The high rollers are not used to riding a bus.  At issue are the massive crowds expected to cross the Hudson River to East Rutherford, NJ, and the weeklong rush of 400,000 visitors. Still want to drive? Parking passes are going for $350 on eBay, and, for the first time, the Super Bowl will have no limo or taxi drop-off zones. So even billionaires will be bussing it, the Wire predicts,  to sit in their frost-covered $10,000 seat. Enjoy the game, everyone!","Worst Possible Super Bowl Seat: $2,700"
"(May 3, 2013  4:09 PM CDT) With the Kentucky Derby running this weekend, everybody's rolling out the feature stories in advance. It will be seriously hard to top this one in the New York Times: It's the story of Conor Murphy, 29, who was shoveling manure last year as a stablehand in England until he placed a $75  accumulator  bet on five horses he liked. All five won—defying odds of more than 160,000/1—and the bet paid off at $1.5 million for Murphy. The native of Ireland immediately moved to Kentucky (he had previously worked there) and bought a stable of his own. Now one of the horses he is training, named Lines of Battle, will run in the derby on Saturday.

As a class project, Mark Haub set out to prove that calorie count was king when it came to dieting, so he subsisted on 1,800 calories worth of Twinkies, Little Debbie Cakes, Doritos, and so forth each day (along with a vitamin, protein shake, and handful of veggies). And not only has he lost weight, his other health indicators have improved, too. His  bad  cholesterol is down 20%, while his  good  cholesterol is up just as much. His body fat percentage is down, too, from 33.4% to 24.9%.  That’s where the head scratching comes,  he tells CNN.  Does that mean I’m healthier? Or does it mean … that we’re missing something?

"(Jan 20, 2016  7:01 PM) A Utah man is facing multiple felony charges after allegedly getting into nearly two dozen car accidents on purpose in order to collect the insurance money, KSL reports. Navid Monjazeb is accused of causing 22 crashes in and around Salt Lake City between 2010 and 2015, collecting $56,000 in insurance money in the process.  He's an opportunistic person, looking for opportunities to crash his vehicle into others or to position his vehicle in such a manner that he puts himself in a blind spot,  ABC4 Utah quotes the director of the state's fraud division. According to the AP, the state launched a six-month investigation into Monjazeb after an insurance company noticed a pattern. On Tuesday, he was charged with 12 counts of insurance fraud and declared  a significant danger to the public,  KSL reports. After causing a crash, authorities say Monjazeb would try to intimidate his victims into paying him cash for the damage or signing a pre-written statement saying they were at fault, KSL reports.  He got out screaming that I had hit him and caused this huge accident,  one victim tells ABC4.  You just assume that it's your fault because you're the one changing lanes.  KSL reports it's unclear if Monjazeb ever got cash from his victims. And the AP notes he's only been charged in cases where investigators believe his car was damaged prior to the crash. According to ABC4, authorities say Monjazeb  would rig [his] vehicles so they'd fall apart when hit.  He also allegedly damaged his car further following accidents to increase the insurance payout, KSL reports. He's facing charges of reckless endangerment in addition to insurance fraud.",Charges: Man Intentionally Caused 22 Car Crashes

That's slightly above the 13.9% rate the couple paid in 2010. Most of the 2011 income was from investments. Campaign officials said the couple filed the return today with the Internal Revenue Service, after receiving an extension. They were to publicly release their full 2011 returns later today. Brad Malt, the trustee of the couple's blind trust, added that Romney and his wife last year claimed a deduction for $2.25 million of their $4.02 million in charitable contributions, reports the AP. In the previous year, a large percentage of those contributions went to the Mormon Church.

Economists had expected 240,000 new jobs, with the unemployment rate expected to drop from 5.7% to 5.6%, the Wall Street Journal reports. The good news: February's new jobs number is the 12th consecutive monthly gain above 200,000. The unemployment rate of 5.5% is the lowest since May 2008, CNN reports. But as the AP notes, the drop happened  largely because some people out of work stopped looking for jobs and were no longer counted as unemployed.  January's numbers were revised downward—239,000 jobs were added that month, not the previously reported 257,000. December's new jobs number of 329,000 held. The average hourly wage barely budged: It rose just 3 cents from January, to $24.78. It's up 2% from a year ago, and CNN frames that: It puts the wage gains of a  healthy economy  in the 3.5% to 4.% range.

The unidentified body was found in one of two locations on the 95-acre property that Kohlhepp, who bought the land two years ago, had identified as graves, ABC reports. The body of a man identified as Charlie Carver—whose girlfriend was found chained up in a storage container on the property—was earlier found in a shallow grave. Police say the 45-year-old Kohlhepp has confessed to killing at least seven people over the last 10 years, including four people who were massacred at a South Carolina motorcycle shop 13 years ago.

Among the victims: four children, eight women, members of an opposing Sunni Muslim tribe, soldiers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, insurgents fighting against Assad, foreign activists and journalists, and even about 120 of its own fighters. Although Reuters says it hasn't been able to independently confirm the British organization's numbers, it notes the publicized stonings and beheadings that ISIS has conducted for what it sees as offenses against Islam, ranging from adultery and homosexuality to blasphemy and stealing. By the monitor's count, 1,175 civilians have been beheaded, stoned, or shot; about 930 of those civilians were part of the Shaitat, a Sunni Muslim tribe that fought ISIS in eastern Syria.

"(Oct 20, 2018  3:00 PM CDT) How do you get millions from a Canadian university? Just ask, apparently. A fraudster emailed MacEwan University in 2017 seeking roughly $9 million (USD) and the school sent it right off, the Toronto Star reports. To be fair, the Edmonton school was busy constructing a $137 million building featuring dance halls and music studios, so the request from Clark Builders, a company on the project, made sense. Only after sending the money did MacEwan learn that Clark Builders never received it and the email's purported author hadn't worked there in years. The funds really went to a Montreal bank account that previously held under $60. From there, over $1 million of it went to East Asia and back to appear legitimate—an international route that made it harder for the RCMP to trace. But trace it they did. According to court documents, most of the money returned to Canada as a loan to Vancouver-based Hoi Fu Enterprises Ltd. The loan came from a Chinese company that, via intermediaries, bought Canadian dollars from a supposed Hong Kong company that had received the Montreal money. And presto, Hoi Fu received about $764,000 in loans to help pay a big new mortgage. Luckily, MacEwan recovered over 92% of lost funds, in part by suing Hoi Fu and seizing money from the bank. The school also set up anti-phishing measures to avoid getting fooled again.  We knew we were at fault ... and we accept that,  a school rep tells the CBC. No arrests have been reported in the case.

According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, all three of North Korea's top military leaders have been replaced, the Guardian reports. A senior US official confirmed to Reuters that the three leaders had been ousted. Yonhap named the military leaders as defense chief Pak Yong Sik, Korean People's Army chief of staff Ri Myong Su, and Kim Jong Gak, head of the KPA's General Political Bureau.

Their replacements  are guys that are Kim Jong Un guys—Kim Jong Un loyalists and people who he trusts,  Michael Madden of the North Korea Leadership Watch website tells the Washington Post. Madden believes Kim made the changes because he wants to have the new military leaders in charge of the country while he is away—and to help oversee changes including possible denuclearization.

Walker's proposal, which requires public employees to pay more for pensions and health care and also strips their unions of most collective bargaining rights, would restructure Wisconsin's general obligation bonds so that debt service payments currently due March 15 would be pushed into future years. The state needs a couple weeks to prepare and implement the refinancing in advance of the March 15 due date, hence Walker's 24-hour warning, Reuters reports.

"(Sep 27, 2014  6:36 AM CDT) A volcano in Japan rumbled to life today unexpectedly, killing a female hiker, the Japan Times reports. At least 40 people were hurt in the eruption of Mount Ontake in central Japan, the AP reports, and the Times notes that 16 were knocked unconscious, per an official. Seven were said to be missing. The mountain spewed ash and initially trapped about 250 hikers on its slopes, reports Reuters. The eruption occurred at midday local time, and by evening most of the trapped hikers had made it down to safety, reports the AP. Many injured, however, are staying in lodges on the mountain. Given the scope of the smoke and ash plumes, it could take a while to account for everyone.  It was like thunder,  a woman tells broadcaster NHK of the first eruption.  I heard boom, boom, then everything went dark.  The 10,062-foot Mount Ontake is about 125 miles west of Tokyo, on the border between Nagano and Gifu prefectures, and Reuters says it last erupted in 2007.

But at Politico, Roger Simon says the White House is keeping a wary eye on a Democrat: Howard Dean.  While today it looks impossible  that Obama would face an intra-party fight,  in politics you have to prepare for the impossible.  Simon says Obama looked  almost meek  in yesterday's press conference, while Dean sounded defiant in a phone interview.  Which one do you think an angry and dispirited Democratic Party might go for?  It's true that Clinton and Reagan rebounded from miserable midterms, but neither faced a legitimate contender from within his party, notes Simon.

Per the Las Vegas Review-Journal, 53-year-old Nhu Nguyen was working at Crystal Nails & Spa on Saturday when the suspect's card failed to work. Sonny Chung, who told the paper he lived and worked with Nguyen, said he and the grandmother of two pursued the suspect into the parking lot before she got behind the wheel of a late model Chevrolet Camaro. A witness told KVVU that Chung ran to the back of the car while Nguyen ran to the front. That's when the suspect sped off, causing Nguyen to suffer blunt force trauma. She was transported to an area hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Authorities say they've since found the vehicle, a rental that had previously been reported as stolen.

Valued at 1% of GDP—and in line with dollar amounts suggested by the Fed—Bush’s plan includes tax relief for individuals and business incentives.

"(May 13, 2017  1:27 PM CDT) Scientists have discovered 467 million hectares of unreported forest—about three-fifths the size of Australia—scattered around the globe, the Conversation reports. The discovery increases the known global forest cover by about 9%. The study—published Friday in Science—focused on  drylands,  areas that lose more water through evaporation and plant transpiration than they receive in precipitation. Trees in drylands aren't very dense, which can make it difficult to measure possible forest cover. According to a press release, old estimates of dryland forests were off due to a number of factors, including low image resolution from satellites and the methods of mapping used. The new study used high-resolution images of more than 210,000 dryland sites from Google Earth Engine and combined them with observations on the ground. Researchers found between 40% to 47% more forest cover in the world's drylands than previously reported. New forests were found on all continents—besides Antarctica. ABC reports the research, led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, gives a new tool in the fight against climate change; it boosts estimates of the amount of carbon stored in plants globally.

"(Feb 3, 2018  7:33 AM) Like a lot of Americans, Kevin Barnaby Jr.'s credit is messed up. The difference in his case is that he's a 4-year-old with two Capital One credit card accounts. Writing for BuzzFeed, Leticia Miranda uses his story as a launchpad from which to dive into the hazy issue of child identity theft. Hazy because, as Miranda writes,  KJ’s experience is not an uncommon one—it's just that child identity theft is poorly documented and poorly policed.  Kids make for good victims, the FTC's identity theft program manager tells her, because their credit is squeaky clean, the theft can go undiscovered for years, and family members have easy access to their SSNs. Sometimes parents use them out of desperation—to keep the lights on, for instance. In KJ's case, his estranged father bought his girlfriend an engagement ring. Miranda asks the big question: Why are banks issuing credit cards based on the SSN of a toddler? Blame loopholes in part, she says, citing a 1974 federal privacy law that makes the feds' SSN database inaccessible to banks and credit bureaus. They're therefore left verifying things using a process of their own making (Miranda points out they could cross-check with the Social Security Administration using a form filled out by the potential credit-card holder, but that would slow the process by up to a week). Making it tougher is that since 2011, kids have been doled out randomized SSNs. In KJ's case, his father allegedly used his son's SSN but his own date of birth to open the cards. He's been convicted of felony identity theft, but KJ's mom is still struggling to clear her son's credit, and is suing three major credit bureaus in an attempt to do so.

The teenagers were in San Diego to compete in a long-distance swim, and 64 of them (plus three coaches) went in the water against the advice of lifeguards, says Sgt. Ed Harris of San Diego Lifeguards, explaining that it was windy at the beach, the waves were two to four feet high, and the water was about 59 degrees. When the group was about half a mile from shore, some swimmers started panicking, which triggered others to panic, and  it just snowballed into a mass rescue,  Harris says. Ultimately, 22 students were pulled out of the water by lifeguards on surfboards, jet skis, and boats, ABC News reports.

Rachel and Heidi McFarland sued their former lawyer in 2014 for malpractice, charging that Jason Rieper failed to obtain a waiver of parental rights from baby Gabriel's birth parents. A jury last Wednesday agreed, granting them the award for emotional distress. Rachel McFarland tells People it felt like  destiny  when a colleague's pregnant teenage daughter agreed to let the couple adopt her baby.  Adoption wasn’t ever our No. 1 choice,  she says. But  the birth mom didn’t care if we were a same-sex couple. It just seemed too good to be true—and it was too good to be true.  The McFarlands were present at the baby's birth in December 2013, named him Gabriel— a strong name —and took him home. Three months later, their lawyer told them that birth mom Markeya Atkins wanted Gabriel back—and that's when they say they learned Rieper had failed to get the necessary paperwork signed. Five weeks later, Atkins found the baby  alone, pale, wet and foaming from his mouth and nose,  per the Register. Gabriel's father, Drew James Weehler-Smith, 17, pleaded guilty in 2015 to manslaughter. Rieper's lawyer denies the attorney was responsible, saying the birth mom changed her mind.

That's the finding of University of Missouri researchers who broke down the types of drunks into four distinct categories in a study published in the Addiction Research & Theory journal. Scientists surveyed 187 pairs of undergraduate  drinking buddies  from a Midwestern university about their sober and intoxicated states. The findings: the subjects were either a Hemingway, Mary Poppins, Nutty Professor, or Mr. Hyde drunk. The largest group: the Hemingways, which represented about 42% of the subjects. These subjects reported experiencing the smallest decrease in organizational and intellectual skills and are  drinkers who tend not to undergo drastic character changes or experience harms  (meaning you probably won't have to worry about getting kicked out of a bar if you're a Hemingway). Per the Guardian, about 23% could be called Mr. Hyde—or Ms. Hyde, since more than half of the subjects who fell into this category were women—meaning they became  particularly less responsible, less intellectual, and more hostile when under the influence of alcohol.  One-fifth earned the honor of being labeled the Nutty Professor, meaning they were more introverted before imbibing and became much more gregarious and uninhibited afterward. The Mary Poppinses, which made up about 15% of the pool, are  particularly agreeable  after drinking—in other words, the happy,  sweet  drunks who don't cause any trouble.

"(Jan 28, 2009  6:40 PM) Starbucks Corp. plans to slash nearly 7,000 more jobs during a new round of store closures and other cuts, the company said as it reported that its profit dropped by more than two-thirds in its fiscal first quarter. The coffee chain plans to close 300 underperforming stores around the world—including 200 in the US—by the end of the fiscal year in addition to the 600 US stores it began closing this summer. The new closures could result in the loss of 6,000 jobs, but the company said it will try to offer employees transfers to other nearby locations. Starbucks also plans to lay off about 700 non-store employees and has reduced the number of new stores it plans to open. The cuts and changes will result in about $500 million in savings in fiscal 2009, the company said.",Starbucks Closing 200 More US Stores

"(Dec 15, 2010  10:57 AM) There’s still a while to go before the official 2012 debates begin—but we have the first unofficial one on our hands, in the form of President Obama’s tax deal. Despite strong support in a vote Monday (only five Republican senators voted against it), 2012 contenders are drawing the battle lines and making it clear they’re either strongly for the deal—or strongly against it. In doing so, they’re making their feelings on taxes and government spending well-known, the Wall Street Journal reports. Those against the deal, like Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, and Mike Pence, say the bill costs too much and is actually more like a stimulus. Those for the deal, like Mike Huckabee, Tim Pawlenty, and Newt Gingrich, praise the extension of the Bush tax cuts. Yesterday, another contender, Sen. John Thune, appeared to critique an op-ed written by Romney, and said critics are only against the deal because it is  politically expedient  for them.

Still, he also told AP that he'll be 70 in 2013,  and that seems like a nice round number.

"(Apr 22, 2015  9:51 AM CDT) The FBI has made a break in the case of $4.9 million in gold bars stolen during a highway heist along Interstate 95 last month. Officers say they've uncovered a single bar worth up to $500,000 in South Florida, though they won't specify how or exactly where they came across it. They are saying, however, that the 26-pound bar was on the truck that was robbed by armed men in North Carolina while en route from Miami to Massachusetts on March 1.  This confirms that there is a South Florida nexus to this crime,  an FBI investigator says, per ABC News.  We believe that additional gold bars from the robbery may still be in South Florida and we continue to need the public's help in solving this crime.  The FBI has added a $25,000 reward for information on the case to the $50,000 reward already offered by TransValue, the company that was transporting the gold. Its guards said they were approached by at least two Spanish-speaking men after they had pulled over due to mechanical issues—a claim that is still under investigation, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The men identified themselves as  Policia  before tying up the guards and leading them into the woods, officers say. Police previously believed the suspects could be tied to Florida because a traffic cone placed behind the van in which the gold was loaded during the robbery featured the marking of a company that only does work in the state.",FBI Finds Lone Gold Bar Stolen in $5M Heist

The fire—which one witness says spread through the hospital in only minutes—occurred in the city of Jazan, one of the poorest areas in the country.

What happened in this hospital was a crime of murder,  the brother of one victim says.  This hospital was not equipped at all to deal with a fire.  A Saudi health official disputed those claims, saying that  many people had been able to escape easily from the blaze because the doors were open and safety equipment was in place.

Obama needs to stir the passions and enthusiasms of a Democratic base that’s been disillusioned with his cave-ins to regressive Republicans. Hillary Clinton on the ticket can do that,  he notes. Echoing Jonathan Alter, Reich suggests that Joe Biden would love to be secretary of state. Putting Clinton on the ticket would also turn the focus away from the economy—a big plus, given the  better than even chance we'll be back in a recession —and put it on the administration's successful foreign policy. An Obama-Clinton ticket would also combine Gallup's  most admired  man and woman this year.

"(Dec 10, 2015  4:40 PM) America's favorite big-box retailer may be responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of US jobs since 2001, Fortune reports. According to a new study from the Economic Policy Institute, Walmart's importing of cheap Chinese goods resulted in the elimination of 400,000 American jobs between 2001 and 2013 by increasing the US' trade deficit with China. It's an estimate the EPI calls  conservative.  About three-quarters of those lost jobs were likely manufacturing jobs, Fortune reports.  These job losses are particularly destructive because jobs in the manufacturing sector pay higher wages and provide better benefits than most other industries, especially for workers with less than a college education,  the study states. The EPI estimates Walmart is responsible for more than 15% of the trade deficit growth from 2001 to 2013, costing 3.2 million US jobs. Fortune reports the EPI's study is based on a 2007 report and—because Walmart doesn't release specifics on its imports— guesswork.  Needless to say, Walmart disagrees with the EPI's findings.  Unfortunately, this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumed that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added,  Fortune quotes a Walmart statement. Economists agree, pointing to retail and transportation jobs created by importing goods, according to the New York Times. In 2013, Walmart announced it would increase its use of American-made goods by $50 billion over the next decade. But the EPI counters that Walmart's importing of Chinese goods has cost 100 US jobs for every one American job it creates with that program.",Study: Walmart's Chinese Imports Cost 400K US Jobs
"(Jan 20, 2016  8:31 AM) The longest prime number ever found has been discovered by a computer in Missouri, and it's a doozy: 274,207,281–1 has 22,338,618 digits, the Guardian reports. The number also known as M74207281 was found by a computer tied to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a 20-year-old project that connects computers around the world looking for prime numbers. In addition to this one, professor Chris Cooper's computers at the University of Central Missouri have unearthed three other record prime numbers—numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one—and this one's a rare type of prime (only 49 of them exist, per the project site): a Mersenne prime, which can be written as one less than a power of two. It's a huge find not just scientifically, but also physically: Wired UK notes that a downloaded text copy of the number runs nearly 22MB. Perhaps pointing out the obvious, the Mersenne site notes  this prime is too large to currently be of practical value,  but computers toiling day and night to unearth primes can help gauge hardware functionality—for instance, GIMPS computers recently found a bug in Intel Skylake CPUs. Big prime numbers are also typically used for security encryption by banks and retailers, notes the BBC, though those numbers usually cap off at hundreds of digits. M74207281 was actually discovered by the Missouri computer in September, but a glitch caused the notification about the find to go unsent, and no one noticed it until the computer got a routine checkup, the website notes. As the Guardian points out, the quest to find the highest prime will go on indefinitely,  since there an infinite number of them —and a nonprofit technology organization is offering a $150,000 prize to whomever finds a 100-million-digit prime first.

His publicist confirms Forster died of brain cancer after a short illness at his Los Angeles home Friday, surrounded by family. The Hollywood Reporter notes Forster didn't even initially plan on being an actor: When he was attending the University of Rochester with the hopes of becoming a lawyer, he followed a classmate he wanted to meet into an auditorium where auditions for Bye Bye Birdie were taking place. Not only did he earn himself a place in the chorus of that production, he ended up marrying the classmate, June Provenzano. In 1965, a year after he graduated, he landed a role in the Broadway show Mrs. Dally Has a Lover. Next came his film debut in Reflections in a Golden Eye, starring Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. During the '70s and '80s, Forster acted in a slew of not-memorable films.  I was taking whatever fell through the cracks,  he told the Chicago Tribune in 2018. At his lowest point, he says he told himself,  You're not dead yet, Bob. You can win it in the late innings.  It was Tarantino who helped resurrect his career: In a 2018 Fandor interview, Forster recalls how he'd tried out for Reservoir Dogs; he didn't get a part, but Tarantino created Max Cherry in 1997's Jackie Brown just for him. Forster said his career after that was  fabulous,  appearing in such films as Mulholland Drive, The Descendants, and El Camino, and in TV series like Twin Peaks, Breaking Bad, and the Tim Allen show Last Man Standing, playing Allen's father. Forster is survived by his partner, Denise Grayson; four children; and four grandchildren.","Jackie Brown , Twin Peaks Actor Robert Forster Dead at 78"

She said to me, 'If a miracle doesn't happen and I don't make it, can you take my children as your own,'  her friend Stephanie Culley tells People.  And I immediately said yes.  That's how Ace, 2, Lily, 5, Dallas, 10, Jaxson, 11, Selena, 14, and Will, 15, ended up living with Culley, her husband Donnie, and their three kids when Laitkep died in May at age 39. Luckily, Donnie is a construction worker who happened to have built their Alton, Virginia, home with enough bedrooms to fit everybody.  There was some higher power working here, everything just sort of fell into place—like us having a big enough house for nine kids,  Stephanie says.  It had to be someone up above looking out for us.  Laitkep was pregnant with Ace in 2014 when she got diagnosed with cancer, had an emergency C-section, and began chemotherapy, reports the Washington Post. Her children's father left the family as she grew sicker, which, ironically, made room for Stephanie and Donnie to step in and obtain temporary custody. Now the parents have a June 19 court date set to secure permanent custody; adoption could follow. And word is they do it all on their own.

"(Apr 25, 2016  7:03 AM CDT) Last week, President Obama announced the US is sending more than 200 additional troops to Iraq to help fight ISIS, and Monday he made a similar declaration regarding Syria, Reuters reports.  Given the success, I've approved the deployment of up to 250 additional US personnel in Syria, including special forces to keep up this momentum,  Obama said from Germany at the tail end of an overseas tour.  They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces as they continue to drive [ISIS] back.  The city of Raqqa has become one of the extremist group's strongholds, and the newly pledged troops will bring the total number of US soldiers up to 300. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said before Obama's announcement that even though these new troops would be in  harm's way,  they're technically not being sent on a combat mission, ABC News notes. Obama also implored others to step up their game in combating the militants.  Even as European countries make important contributions against (ISIS,) Europe, including NATO, can still do more,  he said. The president also praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for setting the example of helping those in need due to violence in the Middle East, saying,  We can't turn our backs on fellow human beings who are here now and need our help now,  per the AP.

Reports differ on how long the site was down (Reuters says 15 minutes; GigaOm says about 45).

The Montana woman and her husband had returned to their hotel room in Flathead County—where they were staying in July for a short trip—when they saw that their border collie, Katie, was gone. Seems the seven-year-old dog got scared by an electrical storm and managed to open the door. But in a rural town bordering wilderness near Glacier National Park, where do you look? King's answer: leave her postal-worker job and hunt for Katie day in, day out, posting hundreds of flyers and putting Katie's image online. The Kings also scoured fields for doggy doo, placed traps, and ordered video cameras to help find their beloved dog, per the New York Times. King even biked and jogged in neighborhoods in the hope her sweat might attract Katie—but no luck. Despite help from strangers, who helped search and left them food, King was crying and getting demoralized. Then a tip on day 57 led them to a neighborhood near the hotel, where King was talking to a woman on the street who said the magic words:  Is that your dog?  King called to a border collie she saw by a tree, and sure enough, Katie trotted over.  All I could think about was, 'I'm done. I got her,'  says King.  I was crying, I was holding onto her, wrapped her up in a bear hug.  Dehydrated and 15 pounds lighter, Katie is on a special diet and expected to recover. And King got something more:  I think what I got out of this was the kindness of strangers,  she says.","Woman Quits Job, Seeks Lost Dog for 57 Days"

Pence recalled being a new member of Congress when news broke of the attack on the World Trade Center. He went to Capitol Police headquarters, where the chief took a phone call and then informed everyone that a commandeered plane was headed for the Capitol and was just 12 minutes out.  So we waited,  he said, per Business Insider.  It was the longest 12 minutes of my life. But it turned to 13 minutes. Then 14.

In a TV interview, the French star of La Vie en Rose speculates that the World Trade Center towers were so outdated that their destruction was engineered and passed off as a terrorist attack, since it would be cheaper than trying to renovate. Central to her theory is that other towers hit by planes haven't burned down or collapsed.

"(Jan 5, 2015  1:27 AM) A nuclear plant leaked oil into Lake Michigan for almost two months, and although the oil wasn't contaminated with radiation, safety groups are alarmed by how long it took the plant to spot the leak. Officials at the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant in southwest Michigan reported the problem to federal authorities on Dec. 20, estimating around 2,000 gallons of oil leaked into the lake starting in late October, reports the Detroit Free Press. Plant officials say the oil leaked from a cooling system at the rate of around 0.04 gallons per minute, which made the leak tough to detect amid water discharge of 1.5 million gallons of water per minute.  We take samples of lake water every day, but the leak was small enough that we didn't pick it up,  a plant spokesman tells MLive.com, explaining that factors including a huge storm at the end of October made it harder to monitor oil flow. The estimate of 2,000 gallons of leakage is a  worst-case scenario  and the true figure is probably less, he says. The director of the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Great Lakes doesn't find that reassuring.  What's concerning is they don't really know the extent of the leak,  he tells the Free Press.

Carrie Tolstedt, former head of community banking, will receive $124.6 million in shares, options, and restricted stock when she abandons ship at the end of the year. The bank announced her retirement in July, before the scam was revealed, reports Fortune. It can reclaim pay from executives linked to wrongful behavior but says it won’t do that with Tolstedt; it isn't clear if she was aware of the scam, though she ran the retail banking and credit card divisions from 2008. A Wells Fargo rep tells CNBC that community banking executives worked to  significantly strengthen  the bank's  training, monitoring, oversight and compensation structure  to combat the accounts scam. The bank says her retirement was a  personal decision  while CEO John Stumpf praised Tolstedt in July as  one of our most valuable Wells Fargo leaders, a standard-bearer of our culture, a champion for our customers, and a role model for responsible, principled and inclusive leadership.

A measure to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 cleared a committee last week and now heads to the full council, reports WTOP. To pass, it needs the support of a majority of the 13-member city council, and WJLA reports that eight members already have voiced their approval. While a handful of US cities allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, none grants the right in national elections. DC has an estimated 10,000 teens of that age, most of them minorities, per WJLA.  At the age of 16, your legal relationship with the government changes,  says council member Charles Allen, who introduced the measure. He points out that many 16-year-olds get jobs and begin paying taxes, and they also start driving.  Ironically, they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘End Taxation Without Representation.’ I think it’s time to change that.  Allen says he was inspired in part by the youth political movement that surfaced after school shootings. If passed by the council and signed by the mayor, the measure must undergo a 30-day congressional review period.

If that sounds extreme, consider this: Somyot Pruksakasemsuk didn't actually write the insults, he just published them. (The author has since fled to Cambodia.) And they didn't appear in articles of fact, but in two fiction stories. Oh, and they didn't actually mention King Bhumibol Adulyadej by name, reports the New York Times. One of the pieces published in the now-defunct magazine centered around a murderous ghost that the court determined was a stand-in for Bhumibol, in a tale that  conveyed connection to historical events.  In an unusual move, Pruksakasemsuk, 51, attempted to argue that the nation's lese majeste law—which allows for a sentence of up to 15 years for anyone who defames the country's royalty—trampled upon his right to free expression. The court wasn't buying it, however, and ruled that the king deserves  special protection.

At 49, Moyer is the oldest Major Leaguer since 2007, and the oldest to take the mound since 1972.

Nichols, who must report to a parole office in Great Falls, was granted parole in April, per the AP, citing coverage in the Missoulian. Nichols, 86, was sentenced to 85 years in prison for kidnapping biathlete Kari Swenson in the mountains near Big Sky and killing Alan Goldstein, a friend helping to search for Swenson when she failed to return home from her run. The reason for the kidnapping? Don wanted Swenson to be a bride for his then 19-year-old son. Swenson, who was 22, said she was chained up during her ordeal and spotted her would-be rescuers before her abductors did. She yelled at them to leave because Nichols had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to help her. Nichols shot Goldstein, and Nichols' son Dan apparently accidentally shot Swenson. She said she was left for dead with a  sucking chest wound  for hours as Goldstein's body lay nearby.

"(Oct 12, 2020  7:30 PM CDT) In 2005, a tourist took a few ancient artifacts that didn't actually belong to her back home to Canada. Things haven't always gone well for her in the intervening years. She  had breast cancer twice,  she said, the last time resulting in a double mastectomy. Her family has had financial problems. So she decided Pompeii can have the stuff back, the Guardian reports. The Archaeological Park of Pompeii received a package containing two mosaic tiles, parts of an amphora and a piece of a ceramic wall—and a letter.  Please, take them back, they bring bad luck,  it said. Saying that she was  young and dumb  when she stole the items, per CNN, the woman wrote,  I wanted to have a piece of history that couldn't be bought.  The package contained another return, stones also swiped in 2005 by a Canadian couple.  We took them without thinking of the pain and suffering these poor souls experienced during the eruption of Vesuvius and their terrible death,  their letter said.  We are sorry, please forgive us for making this terrible choice.  Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, burying the residents of Pompeii, and recent research confirms that it was an awful death. The Archaeological Park says returns and confessions aren't unusual; they have their own museum space there.

A storm hobbled her yacht, however, forcing a dramatic rescue in the Indian Ocean. At the time, Sunderland wrote that she never expected to see her vessel, Wild Eyes, again. Now, much to her surprise, she has finally done so. A plane spotted the boat, overturned and covered in barnacles, drifting off the coast of Australia, reports the BBC.  My heart skipped a beat,  the 25-year-old tells Australia's ABC News.  It brought back many memories—good and not so good—but it was neat to see it after so long.  Australian authorities took photos, but they have no plans to actually retrieve the boat. That would change only if it is deemed a hazard to other vessels. Abby, for her part, wonders if some of the video she shot and stored in waterproof cases might have survived. She now lives in Alabama, her father tells the Australian outlet.  She is a mother of three, soon to be four, happily married,  says Laurence Sunderland. At the time of their daughter's adventure, he and his wife, Marianne, took a lot of grief for allowing her to go.

"(Jan 24, 2016  6:59 AM) A large chunk of metal that could be from an aircraft washed ashore in southern Thailand, but Malaysian authorities on Sunday cautioned against speculation of a link to a Malaysia Airlines flight missing almost two years. Flight MH370 is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean, and only one piece of debris has been identified as coming from the plane, a slab of wing that washed ashore on Reunion Island in the western Indian Ocean last July. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said he instructed Malaysian civil aviation officials to contact Thailand about the newly found wreckage, a curved piece of metal measuring about 6 ½ feet by 10 feet with electrical wires hanging from it and numbers stamped on it in several places.  The markings, engineering, and tooling apparent in this debris strongly suggest that it is aerospace related,  an editor with Flightglobal tells Reuters.  It will need to be carefully examined, however, to determine it's exact origin.  Thailand's Transportation Ministry said four Malaysian officials and two Thai experts will visit the site Monday. Liow said the search for the missing jet, which carried 239 people, is ongoing in the southern Indian Ocean. Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokesman Dan O'Malley said the agency was awaiting an official examination of the debris. The debris was found on the eastern coast of southern Thailand's Nakkon Si Thammarat province, about 370 miles south of Bangkok on the Gulf of Thailand. While debris can drift thousands of miles on ocean currents, that location would be a surprise based on the data from Flight MH370. The plane was tracked by radar flying over the South China Sea then making a sharp turn west. It crossed the Malay Peninsula and Straits of Malacca, which would put it off Thailand's west coast.","Metal Hunk Washes Up, Raises Slim Hope for MH370"

Iranian authorities say 686 hopefuls have registered for the election next month—but all the candidates need to be vetted by the Guardian Council controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has feuded with Ahmadinejad for years and may reject the candidacy of his deputy, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie. If Mashaie—whose aides were arrested for summoning genies amid the power struggle with Khamenei—makes it through the vetting process, he is expected be a frontrunner. Another top-tier candidate is former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, a longtime Khamenei rival who supported the opposition Green movement after 2009's disputed election and entered the race just minutes before the deadline, Reuters reports.

"(Aug 10, 2017  12:35 PM CDT) It's a good thing scientists weren't especially hungry when they stepped inside one of the earliest structures built in Antarctica recently. On a shelf in a hut in Cape Adare sat a  perfectly preserved  fruitcake apparently untouched for more than a century, reports Stuff.co.nz. Made by British label Huntley & Palmers, the fruitcake was hidden inside a  severely corroded  tin taken from the hut as part of a conservation project encompassing several old huts built during a Norwegian expedition in 1899, per AAP. And though its paper had begun to deteriorate, the cake itself looked  like new  and rather tasty. Unfortunately, it didn't smell quite as good, with an odor of  rancid butter,  Lizzie Meek of New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust tells Newshub. The fruitcake was actually one of 1,500 artifacts recovered from the huts. And it wasn't the only food item. There were also  badly deteriorated  meat and fish, sardines, and  rather nice looking  jams, in addition to tools and clothing, Meek says. The fruitcake, however—believed to have been carried to Cape Adare by a member of Robert Falcon Scott's British Antarctic Expedition in 1911—was  quite a surprise,  Meek says.  Most people don't carry a whole fruitcake to Antarctica and not eat it.  Though it's not recommended, you could theoretically taste it if you ever visit Antarctica: Meek says all items found will be returned to the huts. She adds the fruitcake  could very well last another hundred years,  if icy conditions continue.

The 45,000 cap, to be formally announced by President Trump in the coming days, reflects the maximum the US will admit during the fiscal year that starts Sunday, although the actual number allowed could be far lower, the AP reports. Even if the cap is ultimately hit, it would reflect the lowest admissions level for the US in more than a decade. Lowering the cap reflects Trump's opposition to accepting refugees and other immigrants into the US, an approach that has already driven down refugee admissions. President Obama had wanted to take in 110,000 in 2017, but the pace slowed dramatically after Trump took office and issued an executive order addressing refugees.

Alan Langdon showed up Wednesday in Australia after 27 days at sea aboard a homemade, 19-foot boat, the Times of London reports. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Langdon didn't tell anyone where he was going when he set sail with his daughter Que.

I tell you I learnt a lot about sailing.  When he and Que turned up in a seaside Australian town, they were quickly recognized by local sailors from photos disseminated by Chapman. Officials took father and daughter in for questioning, and Chapman says Langdon should face charges in both New Zealand and Australia.

Police say someone stole 19 cases of the Italian cheese from the Do Drop Inn in Pueblo early Tuesday, the AP reports. The restaurant doors were damaged and restaurant manager Kevin Romero tells the Pueblo Chieftain that the thief broke through padlocks on a restaurant freezer to get to the cheese, which is worth around $1,900. Nothing else was taken. Per a police report, clues left at the scene included a crowbar and other  biological evidence.  Romero says this is at least the third time cheese has been stolen from the restaurant, presumably to be sold to other eateries, in the last month and a half. However, this time the thief's image was captured by security cameras the restaurant recently installed.  The first time they came in they stole about probably five or six boxes,  Romero tells KOAA about the increasingly brazen crimes.  The second time was eight to 10 boxes, and now the 19 boxes.

What's more, the patients the IG surveyed waited an average 115 days for a first primary care appointment—a far cry from the 24 days the center reported to the VA, the New York Times reports. The investigation also found  numerous allegations  of  mismanagement, inappropriate hiring decisions, sexual harassment, and bullying behavior by mid- and senior-level managers.  The report doesn't touch on allegations that as many as 40 deaths were tied to waiting list shenanigans.

Herb Peterson began working with McDonald's in the advertising department, and later switched to the hands-on side of the business, owning six restaurants in the Santa Barbara area. Peterson, a big fan of eggs Benedict, came up with the idea for the breakfast-on-the-run Egg McMuffin in 1972, inspiring a host of imitators. Former McDonald's president Ray Kroc first thought Peterson's English muffin combo with egg, Canadian bacon and cheese was a  crazy idea—a breakfast sandwich,  he recalled in his autobiography. But Kroc was sold after a single taste, and the chain moved into the lucrative breakfast business. Peterson remained active in his restaurants until his health started to fail last year.

"(Dec 15, 2017  6:13 AM) Three Michigan brothers went missing under odd circumstances in 2010, and now a box of remains in Montana may offer closure on their fate. Per MLive.com, Michigan State Police are exploring whether there's a tie between the disappearance of the Skelton brothers—9-year-old Andrew, 7-year-old Alexander, and 5-year-old Tanner—and a box found in September by cleaning staff in a Missoula home's shed. Inside the box: the teeth and bones of three children, NBC Montana reports. Testing determined the ages of the deceased children were 2 to 4 years old, 5 to 8 years old, and 6 to 10 years old, though it wasn't noted when they died. Montana's State Crime Lab has now sent the remains to the University of North Texas for DNA testing to see if they're related and to see if a link can be made with any children in a national database for missing persons. The last time anyone saw the Skelton boys was Thanksgiving Day in 2010, when they were in their father's backyard. At the time the boys vanished, John Skelton said he'd given the boys to an unnamed sanctuary group to protect them from his ex-wife. The cops believe he killed them, and in September 2011, Skelton was convicted of unlawful imprisonment and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Police say there's a  person of interest  in the case, which is being investigated as a possible homicide, per a search warrant shown on ABCFOX; the box was found by a cleaning crew after the home's tenant had been evicted. The one roadblock to the DNA testing: The bones are so tiny that it may be too difficult to draw the DNA out.  It may not be the answer we want, but it would just enable the family to have some closure,  a friend of the boys' mother, Tanya Zuvers, tells the Detroit Free Press.",Brothers Vanished in 2010.

The 13-year-old Staten Island boy wrote that things later spiraled downward due to incessant bullying at the hands of five classmates. He went to his teachers and  begged and pleaded  but  they didn't do ANYTHING!  he writes, with the exception of one, but the reprieve  didn't last long.  His 17-year-old sister found Daniel with a belt around his neck in the attic, and his parents tell the New York Daily News their son wrote the letter about a month ago so someone would be  held accountable.  The parents say the bullying is what caused their son's grades to slide from passing to failing, which resulted in a recommendation that he repeat 7th grade; he was set to do so at another school this fall.

The BBC reports that 54-year-old Li Yanxia (aka Li Lijuan) was sentenced to 20 years in prison in Hebei province after being found guilty of extortion, forgery, and disturbing social order, in addition to fraud. Li's story became famous in China more than a decade ago when she started adopting kids at a rapid pace, saying she was inspired to help children after supposedly getting her own son back from the clutches of traffickers. She adopted so many kids that she eventually opened up an orphanage she called  Love Village,  with 118 children in her care at one point in 2017. Her lovefest soon began to unravel. The Chinese government started getting tips on Li, who reportedly had built much of her fortune on iron mining investments and company ownership, and an investigation soon uncovered illegal activities going back to 2011. Per the Global Times, the Wu'an court found that Li had  abused the orphanage's influence and committed fraud ... among other crimes, to obtain vast economic benefit.  Among the allegations: that she'd made some of her adopted kids run under trucks on construction sites so they couldn't do their work; she then blackmailed those construction companies. Li's boyfriend and 14 other accomplices have also been convicted. A lawyer for Li, who was also hit with a $388,000 fine in addition to her jail sentence, tells local media she's likely to appeal.","She Ran a 'Love Village' for Kids. Now, 20 Years in Prison"

Before it can become law, Gov. Jerry Brown must sign the legislation.  We can prevent countless California youth from becoming addicted to this deadly drug, save billions of dollars in direct health care costs, and, most importantly, save lives,  said Democratic Sen. Ed Hernandez, who wrote the bill. Dozens of cities, including New York and San Francisco, have passed similar laws of their own. The higher age limit, part of a package of anti-tobacco bills, won approval despite intense lobbying from tobacco interests and fierce opposition from many Republicans, who said the state should butt out of people's personal health decisions, even if they are harmful. Advocates noted that the vast majority of smokers start before they are 18, according to data from the US surgeon general. Making it illegal for 18-year-old high school students to buy tobacco for their underage friends will make it more difficult for teens to get the products, they said. Opponents said American law and custom has long accepted that people can make adult decisions on their 18th birthday and live with the consequences, including joining the military.

"(Mar 11, 2013  7:45 AM CDT) How the sequester will hit Yellowstone in general is clear: The park needs to ax $1.8 million from what it anticipated would be a $35 million budget. The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal take a look at the specific fallout: Park superintendent Dan Wenk's plan is to reduce seasonal workers, put permanent hiring on freeze, push back the opening of most entrances by as much as two weeks (squashing 50,000 guests; cutting two weeks from the end of the 20-week season would mean losing 267,000 visitors), and delay the snowplows from March 4 to March 18. That last one is particularly rankling: The sequester went into effect just three days before the annual plowing effort was to begin. Yellowstone's plows typically remove as much as 10 feet of snow from 300 roads, and the hope, explains the Post, is that the sun will  melt and soften the snow,  making it simpler to clear and saving the park $30,000 per day, for up to $250,000 in savings. This means the Montana-Wyoming Beartooth Highway, which the National Park Service typically plows half of, won't be passable until June; Cooke City, which lies on a stretch of highway just outside a northwest entrance, won't see the eight-mile section cleared until late May.

"(Dec 23, 2016  9:30 AM) A 27-year-old man will spend the rest of his life behind bars after two college students were lured to a Rochester, NY, home by two women, then tied up and beaten over 40 hours in a horrifying crime that could have come from the script of a Quentin Tarantino movie, a judge said Wednesday, per Rochester Democrat & Chronicle.  Something particularly horrible like this ... sometimes it's worse than homicide. The torture that went on is almost indescribable,  a prosecutor tells the Chicago Tribune. During a trial that wrapped up in November, two University of Rochester football players described how they'd been abducted and tortured by people who'd wrongly identified one of the victims as a football player allegedly involved in a drug-related robbery. As their captors stole funds using the men's bank cards, both were sexually and physically assaulted. One victim was also shot in the leg while attempting to escape; his femur was shattered. Supreme Court Justice Alex Renzi said the pair would've been killed if police hadn’t arrived.  I was trying to think if there were any redeeming qualities that you had, and I couldn't come up with any,  he told the smiling orchestrator, Lydell Strickland, before sentencing him to 155 years behind bars. David Alcaraz-Ubiles, 25, was sentenced to 15 years, while Inalia Rolldan and Ruth Lora were each sentenced to seven years. Five others previously pleaded guilty to kidnapping and were given sentences ranging from 13 to 35 years, reports the Democrat & Chronicle.",Man Gets 155 Years for Crime 'Worse Than Homicide'
"(Apr 24, 2019  1:26 AM CDT) Professional gambler James Holzhauer's amazing Jeopardy! run continued Tuesday when he broke through the $1 million mark, closing in on the $2.52 million regular-season record set by Ken Jennings in 2004. Holzhauer won $118,816 after correctly answering the Final Jeopardy clue  On May 1, 1869, these two men met at the White House, four years and three weeks after a more historic meeting between them  with  Who are Grant and Lee,  CBS reports. No contestant ever won more than $100,000 in a single game before Holzhauer, who now holds the top seven spots on the show's list of biggest single-game winners. Holzhauer, 34, is still a long way from beating Jennings' record, but he is winning at a much faster rate, the New York Times reports. Jennings took 33 games to break the $1 million mark, while Tuesday was Holzhauer's 14th game.  I don’t feel I get enough credit for making small, sensible Jeopardy wagers, which helped the show with its prize budget,  Jennings, whose highest one-day win during his 74-game run was $75,000, joked in a tweet Monday. Former Game Show Network exec Bob Boden tells the Atlantic that the big wins are likely  causing grief for an accountant somewhere,  though he adds that prize budgets aren't usually a game show's biggest expense, and the extra viewers drawn in by Holzhauer's run will more than outweigh the  lopsided results.",Jeopardy!

"(Jul 16, 2020  4:12 AM CDT) If you decide to have an alcoholic drink, limiting yourself to one a day is best—whether you’re a man or woman. That’s the new advice experts are recommending for the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are scheduled to be updated later this year for the first time in five years, the AP reports. The guidelines, which experts say are  aspirational,  currently say men should limit themselves to two drinks a day, and that women should limit themselves to one. That advice has been in place since 1990. In a report released Wednesday, a committee of experts noted there isn’t adequate evidence to support different alcohol recommendations for men and women, and that research supports tightening the limit for men. US health agencies that issue dietary guidelines aren’t required to adopt the committee's recommendations.",Experts: Men Should Limit Alcohol to 1 Drink a Day
"(Mar 23, 2016  4:44 PM CDT) A 12-year-old boy who was shaken as a baby and remained in a vegetative state for the rest of his life has died, authorities said Wednesday. Aiden Stein died Sunday at a Columbus hospital. The case drew national attention when his parents waged a successful legal fight to prevent a court-appointed guardian from having him removed from life support. Three doctors had testified that Aiden would never recover. The Ohio Supreme Court eventually ruled that a probate court lacked the authority to allow a guardian to stop the care keeping Aiden alive when his parents hadn't permanently lost their parenting rights. Four-month-old Aiden was rushed to a Mansfield hospital in March 2004 after his father, 21-year-old Matthew Stein, reported the baby had lost consciousness. Stein was later convicted of felonious assault and child endangerment and spent eight years in prison despite his assertions that he never injured his son. Richland County Prosecutor Bambi Couch Page told the AP on Wednesday that it was  unlikely  she'd pursue further charges against Stein.  I would have to look at the reason (Aiden) died,  Couch Page said.  But there would probably be a stretch in jurors' minds that he died as the result of what the dad did.

"(Mar 14, 2019  9:55 AM CDT) The first charges have been laid 47 years after Northern Ireland's Bloody Sunday, when 13 demonstrators were shot and killed by British troops. A former paratrooper is charged with the murders of two men, James Wray and William McKinney, and the attempted murders of four others: Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, and Michael Quinn. Those four were among 15 injured when bullets rained at a civil rights march in Derry on Jan. 30, 1972, per the Guardian. An initial investigation labeled the demonstrators as violent members of the Irish Republican Army. A separate 12-year investigation—the Saville Inquiry—wrapped in 2010, putting blame on soldiers. They were found to have fired on unarmed and fleeing demonstrators without reason and lied about it for decades. As military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry, the man charged is identified only as  Soldier F,  per the BBC. It was thought another two or three paratroopers would be charged, per the Guardian. However, evidence against 16 ex-soldiers and two members of the Official IRA was  insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction,  according to the Public Prosecution Service. PPS Director Stephen Herron said officials would meet with families of victims  to explain the decisions taken and to help them understand the reasons,  noting  much of the material which was available for consideration by the inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings.  He also stressed that prosecutors have yet to consider allegations of perjury, which is next on the docket.",Soldier Faces Murder Charges 47 Years After Bloody Sunday

"(Jul 29, 2019  12:13 PM CDT) The Charles Manson murders have never really left the public eye, but they've gotten a boost with Quentin Tarantino's new film Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. But Tarantino isn't the only one out with a Manson-related project. Tom O'Neill and Dan Piepenbring are out with the new book Chaos: Charles Manson, the C.I.A., and the Secret History of the Sixties, and as the New York Times explains, there's nothing new about the Manson beat for O'Neill. In 1999 the journalist took on a 3-month assignment with Premiere magazine to explore the murders' effect on Hollywood.  He missed that deadline—by 20 years,  writes Alex Williams, who interviewed O'Neill about what he found. The conversation starts with O'Neill saying the narrative we all accept isn't one he's buying.  We've spent the past 50 years thinking the murders were all about sparking a race war,  says O'Neill. What he turned up led him in another direction. Well, many others.  The Manson family intersected with a multitude of shady characters at so many levels—law enforcement, drug trafficking, even the government, all wiped from the record—that I found good reason to doubt that the Helter Skelter motive was the full story, or even the real story,  he says. One key piece of evidence he cites: an arrest warrant for Manson that was supposedly misdated, leading to Manson and his followers being arrested a week after the murders but then released over the goof. O'Neill says he got his hands on the warrant and it was correct.

That was a Gwinnett County police officer's speculation after two Georgia brothers allegedly drugged and attacked their parents earlier this month. It appears that conjecture may have been spot-on: A search warrant revealed yesterday states that Cameron Ervin, 17, and Christopher Ervin, 22—both being held at the Gwinnett County jail without bond on charges of aggravated assault and first-degree arson—admitted to police  attempting to set the residence on fire, [attempting to strangle] their parents with a pillow and/or plastic bag, and stabbing the father,  the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. And while the Gwinnett County DA told the paper last week that both young men had hinted at a  bad home life,  an unspecified brother reportedly mentioned something even more chilling: that he had been planning this attack since he was 11. The brothers reportedly offered to make dinner for their parents the night before the attack, the warrant notes—a meal at which Yvonne and Zachary Ervin both apparently ingested Xanax-spiked drinks, police say. The parents revealed to cops that  their sons used plastic wrap and plastic bags to try to asphyxiate them,  per WSB-TV, and Yvonne said  the sons poured an unknown substance on her and then she felt heat on the back of her leg and she believed this was ... to set her on fire.

Police say 31-year-old Jamie Gilt was accidentally shot by her 4-year-old son while driving down a road in Putnam County, reports the Chicago Tribune. The boy had apparently found a loaded .45-caliber handgun on the floor of her pickup.  She was shot through the seat and the round went through her back,  a police spokesman tells the Florida Times-Union.  There was a booster seat in the back of the vehicle, but ... the boy was not strapped in when the deputy got to them,  he says. Gilt was rushed to the hospital and the boy was turned over to family members. Gilt has had a strong pro-gun presence on social media, including the now offline  Jamie Gilt for Gun Sense  Facebook page, where just hours before the shooting she boasted that her 4-year-old  gets jacked up to target shoot.  In a press release, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office says it has been unable to interview Gilt because of her injuries. The office says the gun was legally owned, but it is a  misdemeanor for a person to store or leave, on a premise under his or her control, a loaded firearm in such a manner that it is likely a child can gain access to the firearm.

McCarthy was originally scheduled to be executed in January, but a judge moved it to April to give her more time to appeal.

"(Nov 23, 2013  2:50 PM) Over a four-year period, a Florida man has been stopped by Miami Gardens police 258 times, searched 100 times, and jailed 56 times, even though his most serious conviction is for having marijuana. Earl Sampson has been arrested 62 times for trespassing, nearly always at the 207 Quickstop convenience store—where he works. And he's not the only one: His fellow employees and customers at the shop are regularly stopped by police, to the consternation of owner Alex Saleh, who had security cameras installed for protection... against the cops, the Miami Herald reports. Most of the people who work in or shop at the store, including Sampson, are low-income African-Americans. About three years ago, Saleh agreed to participate in a  zero-tolerance  program, in which police try to eliminate small crimes to expose more serious criminals. That's when police started hassling customers and arresting workers during shifts, he says. The videos reveal startling police behavior: In one, they arrest Sampson while he's stocking coolers; in that instance, he went to prison for trespassing, with an arrest report saying he was he was loitering outside.

But after the surgery, Long wrote in a report:  It appeared that the left testicle and cord may actually have been removed instead.  A follow-up visit confirmed that.

"(Apr 20, 2018  1:30 PM CDT) Legend has it that Donald Trump used to pose as his own PR person back in the 1980s and '90s and phone reporters to talk about how great Trump was. Now a former reporter for Forbes magazine is offering up a taped phone conversation he had with  John Barron  in 1984, and Jonathan Greenberg writes that he is now sure  Barron  was actually Trump. You can listen for yourself via the Washington Post op-ed. At the time, Greenberg was a young reporter working on the magazine's then-new  Forbes 400  ranking of rich Americans. The magazine had pegged Trump's wealth at $200 million in the 1983 list, and  Barron  was calling to complain that Trump should be much higher in the next ranking. Greenberg writes that he was skeptical at the time, and he was proud of himself and his magazine for resisting Trump's efforts to inflate his worth beyond $200 million.  The joke was on me,  he writes. Greenberg now maintains that even the $200 million figure was a stretch.  Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all,  he writes.  In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million.  Greenberg details what he calls Trump's deception about his real estate operation.  The tactic landed him a place he hadn’t earned on the Forbes list—and led to future accolades, press coverage and deals,  he writes.  It eventually paved a path toward the presidency.

The couple, trapped as flames surrounded their mountaintop Santa Rosa home, ended up spending six hours sheltering in the water as the fire raged around them, the Los Angeles Times reports. Jan, 65, says they tried to drive away but encountered a  wall of flames.  They fled to the pool when a 911 dispatcher advised them to shelter anywhere they could. John, 70, was initially reluctant to enter the cold water, but he jumped in after the flames ignited both the neighbors' home and a tree next to the pool. The Pascoes say they held each other all night in the pool, staying under the surface as much as they could to avoid flying embers and debris. When they emerged, they found that their home and the neighbors' home had burned to the ground—and a phone Jan had left in a sock next to the pool had melted.

She wanted to stand up for herself,  says Katrina Saleen, attorney of the 35-year-old woman who accused Pompey, 49, of secretly recording them having sex and posting tagged images from the video on Facebook in 2016.  She testified she was shaking, felt numb. She threw up that day,  says Saleen.  ...She was suicidal the day of, but her best friend and family members talked her through it.  Once the images were posted, her daughter testified that the victim withdrew and was  not even there,  Saleen adds.

The attorney says Pompey also pleaded no contest in an earlier revenge-porn case but only got a  slap on the wrist.  California in 2015 passed criminal laws against posting secretly recorded sex-act videos, but they are misdemeanors that often lead to light sentences.

A study's recommendation: Walk more, the New York Times reports. In a study out this month, a researcher had two groups of students take in 75 grams of fructose daily, corresponding to a typical American eating style. At the same time, she called on the students to cut their intake of calories not from fructose, helping them to avoid gaining weight. Each group spent a week moving twice as much as usual, amounting to about 12,000 steps, or 6 miles, per day. Each group also spent a week moving half as much as they usually would. The low-movement week led to a significant decrease in healthiness, including a huge boost in inflammation indicators and heightened amounts of unwanted lipoproteins. Tests even showed traits associated with the approach of diabetes. But the week of extra activity largely washed away the negative consequences of high fructose consumption.  I don’t want people to consider these results as a license to eat badly,  the researcher tells the Times.

Per the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat told a town hall crowd that she's now focused on her re-election bid, but bets are off thereafter.  After Nov. 6 I will take a hard look at running for president,  Warren said after railing against Republican colleagues she characterized as  powerful men helping a powerful man make it to an even more powerful position  who were  too chicken  to personally question Christine Blasey Ford during her testimony regarding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. As she does frequently, Warren took this opportunity of her 36th meeting with constituents since President Trump took office to attack the current White House occupant, per the AP.  Trump is taking this country in the wrong direction,  said Warren, who also tipped her hat to the #TimesUp movement and said the time is now  for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.  Hours after Warren's comments Saturday, Trump referenced her using a much derided nickname as he spoke to a rally in West Virginia. The Democratic party has gone  so far left, Pocahontas is considered a conservative,  Trump said, per CNN. Trump has used the slur ever since his 2016 campaign to ridicule Warren's claims to Native American ancestry.

"(Nov 24, 2015  3:40 PM) A driver died Sunday in Kansas after losing control of her 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, rolling down an embankment, and landing upside down in a creek, the Topeka Capital-Journal reports. The driver? An 8-year-old girl.  Grandpa said he gave her permission to drive and she crashed,  a Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson tells the St. Joseph News-Press.  It is just really an unfortunate accident.  According to the Capital-Journal, Cadence Orcutt was driving the car with her grandfather in the passenger seat when she overcorrected to the left and went off the road. She wasn't wearing a seatbelt at the time. The News-Press notes it's unclear why Cadence lost control of the car. Emergency responders found Cadence dead at the scene, the News-Press reports. Her grandfather was injured and taken to a local hospital for treatment. An investigation into the crash is ongoing, and charges are possible against Cadence's grandfather. Following the crash, the girl's mother took to Facebook to defend her parenting, according to the Capital-Journal. She says she would never have let her daughter drive if she had been there.

"(Jun 2, 2017  6:46 AM CDT) A recent landslide is the largest one a rep with California's Department of Transportation is aware of, and the US Geological Survey explains just how big it was. The May 20 slide in Big Sur involved more than a million tons of rock and dirt, and by analyzing before-and-after photos, the USGS has determined that roughly 13 acres of  new California land  were created, per a Thursday tweet. In a Facebook post, it provides some other ways of looking at the slide, writing that it was big enough to have  filled 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools [and] buried Highway 1 more than 65 feet deep.  The Mercury News provides a visual of its own, saying the new bit of California is as big as 10 football fields— an exhilarating event for a state used to watching its edges erode.  Kevin Schmidt with the USGS agrees, telling the paper,  It has been a number of decades since something this large increased our land mass.  The falling rock covered a quarter-mile stretch of Highway 1, and the state's transportation department believes it'll take more than a year to get it clear for passage again. CNN notes that portion of the highway was already closed, and had been open on only rare occasions since January because of heavy rain. As for how long the new land will last, an earth sciences professor estimates it'll be eroded within a decade. (Hawaii is growing, but for a different reason.)",California Is Now 13 Acres Bigger

Such costs amounted to nearly $224 billion in 2006, or $1.90 per alcoholic beverage, the AP reports. But though federal, state, and local governments paid for 80 cents of that $1.90, the rest was spent by others including the drinkers themselves, their families, private health insurers, employers, and victims of alcohol-related crimes.

"(Jun 19, 2013  7:59 PM CDT) Sci-fi meets the crime blotter: US authorities accused two men of assembling a portable X-ray weapon that they intended to use to secretly sicken opponents of Israel. The indictment charged 49-year-old Glendon Scott Crawford of Galway, NY, and 54-year-old Eric J. Feight of Hudson, NY, with conspiracy to provide support to terrorists with the weapon. Investigators said Crawford approached Jewish organizations last year looking for funding and people to help him with technology that could be used to surreptitiously deliver damaging and even lethal doses of radiation against those he considered enemies of Israel. He and Feight assembled the mobile device, which was to be controlled remotely, but it was inoperable and nobody was hurt, authorities said.  Crawford has specifically identified Muslims and several other individuals/groups as targets,  investigator Geoffrey Kent said in a court affidavit. According to the indictment, Crawford also traveled to North Carolina in October to solicit money for the weapon from a ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan, who informed the FBI. Crawford claimed to be a member. Both men are being held pending hearings and face up to 15 years in prison. Crawford, an industrial mechanic for General Electric, knew Feight, an outside GE contractor with mechanical and engineering skills, through work, authorities said.

Scientists today unveiled the most accurate data ever recorded from the radiation left over from the milliseconds after the Big Bang, revealing that the universe is roughly 80 million years older than advertised, Science News reports. Of course, that only amounts to a 0.5% difference given that the universe is around 13.81 billion years old. But that was far from the only finding of value. The data comes from the Planck space telescope, and combines to form a kind of map of the universe.  It might look like a dirty rugby ball, but some cosmologists would have given up their children to get a copy of this map,  says one University of Cambridge cosmologist.

"(Apr 21, 2015  5:03 AM CDT) In the first verdict to be issued against Egypt's first freely elected leader, ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi has been sentenced to 20 years in prison over the killing of protesters in 2012. As the sentence was issued, Morsi and other defendants in the case—mostly Muslim Brotherhood leaders—stood in a soundproof glass cage inside a makeshift courtroom at Egypt's national police academy. Seven of the accused were tried in absentia. In addition to Morsi, 12 Brotherhood leaders and Islamist supporters were also sentenced to 20 years. The judge dropped murder charges involved in the case and said the sentences were linked to the  show of force  and unlawful detention associated with the case. During the hearing, Morsi and the rest of the defendants in white jumpsuits raised the four-finger sign symbolizing the sit-in at the Rabaah al-Adawiya mosque, where hundreds were killed when security forces violently dispersed the sprawling sit-in by Morsi's supporters on Aug. 14, 2013. Morsi faces several more trials on charges including conspiring to break militants out of prison during the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak, conspiring with foreign groups to commit terrorist attacks in Egypt, and passing state secrets to Al Jazeera, the BBC reports.

First came his lengthy interview on Fox News, in which he repeated his claims of election fraud. And on Sunday night, he tuned in to 60 Minutes and lashed out about what he saw. The show featured an interview with Christopher Krebs, the former federal official who vouched for the integrity of the election, only to be fired by Trump.  We did it right,  Krebs told interviewer Scott Pelley.  This was a secure election.  But Trump took exception to that, tweeting Sunday night that this  was probably our least secure (election) EVER!  The president again repeated his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, tweeting there was  NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION.  But Krebs, a Republican, shot down allegations of rigged voting machines, hacking by foreign entities, etc.  There is no foreign power that is flipping votes,  he said.  There’s no domestic actor flipping votes.  He also defended election officials such as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, another Republican.

"(Feb 5, 2017  4:30 PM) President Trump has taken 19 executive actions since taking office, the AP reports. Rep. Rob Bishop has a No. 20 in mind. NPR reports on the Utah Republican's push to undo the Bears Ears National Monument created by Barack Obama during his last days in office. It was a highly controversial move that bans new development (think oil, cattle grazing) across its 1.3 million acres. The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition pushed Obama to use the power granted to him under the 1906 Antiquities Act to make the land a national monument, and the president did exactly that. Bishop wants Trump to strike the move, or reduce Bears Ears' scope. But as NPR reports, undoing a national monument so big wouldn't just be unprecedented—it's also unclear if Trump can do it. The Act gives Congress alone the power to undo a designation, giving presidents just to power to designate.  Legally, it's untested,  said Interior Secretary nominee Ryan Zinke during his Senate confirmation hearing. Bishop isn't the only one asking, though: On Friday Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed House Concurrent Resolution 11, which asks Trump to undo the monument. Fox13 relays some hearsay: Herbert says he heard Trump could make a move on the monument this coming week. The Native American tribes who fought for the monument say they'll sue if that does come to pass. Read more on the battle for Bears Ears here.",Utah Rep Wants This to Be Trump's 20th Executive Action
"(Apr 20, 2011  1:22 AM CDT) Scientists poring over satellite images and topographical charts have discovered a flood of new islands. A study has identified 657 new barrier islands around the world, bringing the total number of islands in the world to 2,149, LiveScience reports. Such islands tend to occur in chains, forming a series of small land masses parallel to coastlines as deposits of sand and sediment build up over time. Among the islands previously overlooked is a 54-island chain in Brazil stretching for hundreds of miles off the coast of a mangrove forest south of the Amazon river. Older satellite images didn't show a clear separation between the islands and mangrove. The researchers say their work will help identify barrier islands in danger of disappearing due to development and rising sea levels.

In an effort to solve its 2012 mystery, Atlas Logistics Group Retail Services—which operates warehouses that store products en route to grocery stores—swabbed some of its employees to collect their DNA. Jack Lowe and Dennis Reynolds were two of them, and their DNA didn't match that taken from the poop, which had been found in the aisles and on canned goods. So they sued. Courthouse News Service reports that they cited the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which  generally prohibits  a company from asking its workers to hand over their genetic info. Last month, US District Judge Amy Totenberg determined Atlas did indeed seek and obtain such info as outlined by GINA, even though the test didn't disclose any medical details. She denied Atlas' motion for summary judgement, and the New York Times spoke to legal experts who believed this to be the only case involving GINA to go to trial. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the men were on Monday handed a total of $475,000 in compensatory damages for pain and suffering and $1.75 million in punitive damages; GINA has a $600,000 cap on such damages, however, meaning the amount could ultimately be reduced. The company's lawyer is not pleased: Dion Kohler says the men produced  very little evidence ... of emotional injury,  and as for the punitive damages, which are intended to dissuade Atlas and others from repeating the transgression, Kohler says there's no need.

While the CDC reported Thursday that this year's flu vaccine was only 36% effective overall, it was more effective—59%—in children, which CDC acting director Dr. Anne Schuchat says is  better than we expected.  So far, three out of four children killed this flu season hadn't received a flu vaccination. Schuchat says parents should still get their children vaccinated even though we're months into the flu season.

Ladislas Ntaganzwa was arrested in the eastern Congo city of Goma late Monday, according to Rwandan Prosecutor General Richard Muhumuza. Ntaganzwa is among the nine most-wanted fugitives in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, which killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda sought Ntaganzwa to answer charges related to participation in genocide and incitement to commit genocide, but closed its proceedings last week after nearly 20 years of pursuing and prosecuting genocide suspects and transferred Ntaganzwa's case to Rwanda. Muhumuza said the country has started extradition proceedings for Ntaganzwa to stand trial in Rwanda. According to ICTR's indictment of Ntaganzwa, he is accused of substantially participating in the planning, preparation, and execution of the massacre of over 20,000 Tutsis at Cyahinda Parish from around April 14 to 18, 1994, when he was mayor of Nyakizu. On April 15, 1994, Ntaganzwa, armed with a gun, transported gendarmes in a vehicle while Hutu civilians and Burundian refugees he had incited earlier arrived on foot and surrounded Cyahinda Parish to prevent the Tutsis from escaping, the indictment says. He then gave the order for the massacre to begin, and many Tutsis were killed or harmed.

"(Dec 17, 2009  11:49 AM) Today marks the 20th anniversary of The Simpsons, a show that has influenced everything from modern TV to the president’s speechwriter—but is now barely relevant.  There will never be another show or entertainment program as wide-reaching as The Simpsons,  says John Ortved, author of The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History. But, he tells Salon,  After it hit that 10-year mark, the show had a serious drop-off in quality, and it's just never, ever come back.  Though the plots have become  outdated  and the episodes filled with  throwaway jokes,  there’s no denying the show's impact:  The Simpsons made audiences a lot smarter —and willing  to accept a certain level of irreverence,  Ortved says.  The Simpsons in one way or another gave us most of what's smart and progressive in television.  What’s next for the franchise?

"(Jan 20, 2017  8:49 AM) Dennis Hastert has had seven months behind bars to figure out his next move, and he's just made a big one. The former US speaker of the House is not only asking a judge to spurn a breach-of-contract complaint filed against him by a man who says Hastert sexually abused him as a teen, he's also demanding his accuser pay him back $1.7 million that was given to keep the man quiet about his allegations, the Chicago Tribune reports. The man known in court documents as Individual A says his 2010 oral contract with Hastert—who's been behind bars in Minnesota since June, serving out a 15-month sentence for trying to finagle bank withdrawals so no one would know he was obtaining the so-called  hush money —called for a total payout of $3.5 million. Individual A filed a suit against Hastert in April asking for the remaining $1.8 million, which Hastert says isn't coming. Not only that, but he says the money he already gave Individual A is due back to him since the man broke his word on the unwritten deal and talked to the FBI, NBC News reports. Hastert's counterclaim filing Wednesday in Illinois' Kendall County Circuit Court said Individual A was supposed to keep quiet  for the remainder of his life,  per the AP. Hastert also wants his attorneys' fees paid for by his accuser. Individual A's lawyer, Kristi Browne, says Hastert's latest maneuver is  predictable.   He admits to agreeing to make payments, but then denies that it is an agreement that he has to keep,  she says, per the Tribune. Hastert, 75, who wasn't actually charged with any sex crimes in the case due to an expired statute of limitations, is set to be paroled in August.",Jailed Hastert to Accuser: I Want My $1.7M Back
"(Nov 7, 2014  9:52 AM) Ukraine accused Russia today of sending in dozens of tanks and other heavy weapons into Ukraine's rebel-controlled eastern areas. National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said at least 32 tanks, 16 artillery systems, and 30 trucks loaded with fighters and ammunition had crossed into eastern Ukraine from Russia. He provided no specific evidence or timetable, and it wasn't immediately clear how his agency had obtained the information since parts of Ukraine's eastern border with Russia have been under rebel control since August. Ukraine and the West have continuously accused Moscow of fueling a pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons, accusations that Russia has denied. Russia's Defense Ministry had no immediate comment on Lysenko's statement, but earlier today it again rejected Western allegations that Moscow was deploying more troops near the border. Despite a ceasefire signed two months ago, Ukrainian troops and separatist rebels are still fighting near the airport of the main rebel-held city of Donetsk and a few other areas. Tensions rose further after the rebels held an election Sunday that Ukraine and the West denounced as a violation of the Sept. 5 truce. Russia welcomed the vote but in carefully chosen language: Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, emphasized today that Moscow's statement saying it  respects  the rebel vote doesn't amount to its recognition; he added that Russia wants peace talks to continue.",Ukraine Says Russia Sent 32 Tanks Across Border

The building's landlord discovered the prisoners on Saturday, lying in their own filth in a 10-by-15-foot room, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports.

The alleged kidnappers arrived in the apartment around Oct. 3, but police said they’ve had the victims for much longer—they reportedly lived in Texas then spent 18 months in West Palm Beach before being driven to Philly; it's unclear if they were imprisoned during that entire time, reports the Inquirer. Their scheme appears to have been to collect the captives’ Social Security checks.

The BBC reports 41-year-old Alexander Cirk flew from his native Holland to China to meet a 26-year-old woman with whom he'd struck up an online relationship two months earlier. Cirk believed his internet girlfriend, known only as Zhang, was going to meet him at Changsha airport. But she wasn't there when he arrived, and she didn't show up over the next 10 days, which Cirk spent living in the airport. Cirk likely would have kept waiting for Zhang except that he had to be taken to the hospital for physical exhaustion, according to Metro. After leaving the hospital, Cirk flew home without ever meeting his would-be love interest. But Zhang says we shouldn't be too quick to judge her. She says she and Cirk had talked about waiting a year before meeting, so she was caught off guard by his arrival, Shanghaiist reports. She says Cirk had  seemed a little callous towards me,  so when he sent her photos of his plane tickets,  I thought it was a joke.  In fact, when Cirk arrived at Changsha, Zhang was in another province having cosmetic surgery. She says that's why he wasn't able to reach her. But despite what appears to be an extreme case of miscommunication, Zhang says she is still interested in continuing her relationship with Cirk.

But this time the AMA's throwing that financial might behind President Obama’s effort, thanks in part to an eye-popping handout. Democrats decided to rescind scheduled Medicare cuts in the bill, to the tune of $228 billion over the next decade. Democrats defend that as necessary for the stability of the medical system, but it stands as the most expensive concession any interest group has received. Doctors, too, stand to benefit as more patients gain health care access.  Doctors are really, really discouraged now about people not getting access to medical care,  says the group’s former president.",How Obama Wooed and Won the AMA: With a $228B Gift
"(Dec 20, 2016  12:45 AM) Uber is fast establishing itself as a modern, 21st-century way to lose a lot of money, according to the latest financial results. Bloomberg reports that the company's losses have been  eye-popping  this year, with an $800 million loss in the third quarter bringing total losses to at least $2.2 billion, a figure that could top $3 billion when fourth-quarter results come in. A source tells Bloomberg that net revenue has risen along with losses and is expected to reach more than $5.5 billion this year. The loss figures do not include interest or taxes, meaning Uber's losses could be even higher than reported. The company is believed to have lost at least $2 billion in 2015. Insiders tell the Wall Street Journal that the losses resulted from big spending on promotions to attract new drivers, and on investment in new parts of the business like the UberEATS delivery service and the self-driving car project that has led to clashes with California regulators. According to CNBC, Uber's losses in the third quarter would have been even higher if it hadn't left the China market, selling its local business to Beijing-based rival Didi Chuxing as part of a deal that saw the Chinese firm invest $1 billion in Uber. Bloomberg's sources say Uber managed to make a slight profit in the US in the first quarter of this year, but it lost $100 million in its home market in the second quarter and more than that in the third.",Uber's Losses Top $2B for the Year

The lions of the Marsh pride, which lives in the Masai Mara reserve, are the stars of the BBC's long-running and very popular Big Cat Diary. A female lion named Bibi—who appeared on the show from 1996 to 2008—was found dead Monday, according to the BBC.

Local farmers have been known to leave poisoned meat out as punishment when lions attack their cattle.

The Chicago man hit the ground, looked back,  and he was just on me,  Hillmann tells People.  At the last second, he shot me straight up in the air. The horns just went in in a really weird way.  As the 1,200-pound beast named Sentido stormed away along the narrow streets of Pamplona, Hillmann says he didn't feel  piercing pain  and managed to pick himself up and walk to find help.

At 21, Deborah married Andrew Cavendish, the second son of the Duke of Devonshire. She became a duchess accidentally after the first son and heir—who was married to JFK's sister—died in World War II. The couple inherited money, an Irish castle, and the 35,000-acre Chatsworth estate, which included a difficult-to-maintain 300-room mansion. Deborah eventually turned it into one of Britain's most popular rural tourist sites and a self-sustaining business.

The pileup in Etna, near Bangor, happened around 7:30am and involved several cars, a school bus, and a tractor-trailer, state police spokesman Steve McCausland says. No fatalities were immediately reported, but McCausland says some of the injuries were serious. Emergency personnel climbed on top of cars to reach motorists stuck in the middle of the chaotic tangle of vehicles. McCausland says one veteran trooper described the site as a  giant pile of metal.

"(Sep 29, 2016  4:43 AM CDT) Acutely partisan and all but dysfunctional, Congress has completed its most elementary task after an intense weekslong struggle, finalizing a deal to fund the government just days ahead of a shutdown deadline, the AP reports. The legislation extends existing spending levels a mere 10 weeks, past Election Day, while finally addressing the Zika crisis with $1.1 billion and providing long-sought help for the residents of Flint, Mich., as well as flood victims in Louisiana. After a last-minute burst of deal-making, the legislation passed the Senate on a 72-26 vote Wednesday and was backed by the House 342-85 in a late-night vote. Republicans, defending a fragile Senate majority and eager to get a handful of vulnerable incumbents back home to campaign for re-election, accused Harry Reid of holding up a deal to keep GOP lawmakers off the campaign trail. Democrats lobbed their own allegations, all but accusing Republicans of racism for holding up money for people affected by lead-tainted water in Flint. The situation produced frustration all around as lawmakers of both parties lamented their inability to get their basic work done, even if each party insisted the other was to blame. Yet even as they stumbled to a messy solution, some lawmakers were already looking ahead to next year, when much weightier tasks await the next Congress and a new president in what may be an even more fraught era of divided government.",Congress Averts Shutdown With 10-Week Deal

The suit filed by trustee Irving Picard says the investments were used as vehicles to funnel money out of Madoff's business, and comes as a follow-up to the lawsuit he filed in November seeking nearly $200 million from Madoff family members who he said lived lavishly while using the family business like a  piggy bank.  Picard wrote in the latest suit that Bernie Madoff was  quite generous  with the money he stole from thousands of customers in history's largest Ponzi scheme.

The victim was Marie Smothers, 87. The boy has not been identified because of his age. He originally told police the shooting was unintentional, but authorities say their investigation has led them to believe the boy  intentionally shot Mrs. Smothers in the back of the head as she sat in her living room watching television,  CNN reports.

"(Sep 24, 2015  6:13 AM CDT) President Juan Manuel Santos and leaders of Colombia's largest rebel group vowed to end Latin America's longest-running armed conflict in the coming months after a breakthrough in talks put the country closer to peace that it has been in half a century. Speaking in Havana, the site of talks, Santos announced yesterday that government and rebel negotiators, prodded by Pope Francis, had set a six-month deadline to sign a final deal. After that, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia would demobilize within 60 days.  We are on different sides but today we advance in the same direction, in the most noble direction a society can take, which is toward peace,  said Santos, minutes before a forced, cold-faced handshake with the military commander of the FARC guerrillas, known by his alias Timochenko. The US lauded the breakthrough, with John Kerry saying that  peace is now ever closer for the Colombian people and millions of conflict victims.  In a joint statement, Santos and the FARC rebels said they had overcome the last significant obstacle to a peace deal by settling on a formula to punish human rights abuses committed in 50 years of bloody fighting. Under the terms, rebels who confess abuses to peace tribunals, compensate victims, and promise not to take up arms again will receive from five to eight years of labor but not in prisons. War crimes committed by Colombia's military will also be judged by the tribunals and combatants caught lying will face up to 20 years in jail. While a final accord may be within reach, the huge challenges of implementing it are just beginning. Negotiators must still come up with a mechanism for rebels to demobilize and then the government needs to come up with additional money to spread the benefits of peace. A more immediate test comes via a referendum, in which Colombians get a chance to reject any deal, which must also clear congress.",This Handshake Could End 50 Years of Bloodshed
"(Oct 14, 2015  8:27 AM CDT) Apple lost phase one Tuesday of a lawsuit against it by a patent enforcement group that Business Insider once called one of the  most fearsome patent trolls  around—a loss that could cost up to $862 million in damages, Reuters reports. A US District Court jury decided Apple had violated a 1998 patent for technology that improves processor efficiency—a patent owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing division—by incorporating that technology into the A7, A8, and A8X processors found in its iPhone 5, 6, and 6 Plus models. The jury also found the patent is valid, a claim Apple unsuccessfully tried to take up with the US Patent and Trademark Office before. Presiding Judge William Conley broke the trial down into three phases: liability, damages, and whether Apple had willfully violated the patent, which could lead to more penalties. Indeed, WARF had filed for triple damages because it said the patent infringement was  willful, intentional, and in conscious disregard of WARF's right,  per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. This isn't the first time Apple has been sued for iPad/iPhone patent infringement—Boston University filed a complaint in 2013, the Verge reports—or the first time WARF has sued over this technology (Intel settled in 2009). WARF also sued Apple a second time last month over the newest A9 and A9X chips found in recently released iPhones and the iPad Pro, per Reuters. Still, a Warwick Business School professor tells CNET that  parallel developments  by different companies means competing intellectual-property claims are  inevitable  and any damages Apple pays won't  have a substantial or lasting impact on its earnings.

"(Oct 16, 2018  4:47 PM CDT)  It's a classic murder case, where you've got a husband, you've got a lover, and you've got a dead wife.  One of those two men spent almost 20 years behind bars for the crime—and prosecutors now believe it was the wrong one. The AP reports Horace Roberts was released from prison Oct. 3 and fully exonerated Monday in the death of Terry Yvette Cheek, the co-worker with whom he was having an affair. Her strangled body was found alongside a highway in Riverside County, Calif., in April 1998, next to what seemed like telltale clues: Roberts' truck and a Lorus wristwatch believed to be his. Prosecutors argued he had killed Cheek after she threatened to put an end to their relationship and he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999 and sentenced to 15 years to life. Now, prosecutors say DNA evidence indicates Cheek's husband, Googie Harris, and nephew were behind her murder—and that's not all. That  classic murder case  quote comes from Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project, which has worked for 15 years to secure Roberts' freedom and believes Harris purposefully left behind clues that would implicate Roberts.  I guess [Harris] was getting the ultimate revenge,  Brooks tells the Washington Post. Roberts had lied about the affair when confronted by police, and prosecutors seized on that, even though he had an alibi for the night: He called Cheek a number of times from a pay phone near his house when she didn't show up as she was supposed to. DNA tests performed on the watch and Cheek's fingernails in 2013 and 2017 were key to Roberts' exoneration. Harris and Joaquin Leal are being held on $1 million bail.

A jury in Virginia sided with Col. David  Wil  Riggins against blogger Susan Shannon in Riggins' defamation lawsuit, the Washington Post reports. Riggins was about to be promoted to brigadier general in 2013 when Shannon made the accusations on her Short Little Rebel blog. He was removed from the promotion list, despite the Army's Criminal Investigative Division concluding that it could not  prove or disprove Ms. Shannon’s allegation she was raped.  Riggins retired soon afterward and sued Shannon, saying her account was  provably false.  The jury deliberated for less than three hours before ordering Shannon to pay $3.4 million in compensation for damage to his reputation and $5 million in punitive damages, the Post reports. The final settlement is likely to be reduced to $2.3 million under Virginia law. Shannon's testimony was so flawed that  we thought who was telling the truth was too obvious to be discussing,  says juror Marshall Reinsdorf.  We held a vote, and everybody believed the colonel. The only argument was how big the damages were going to be.  He says they decided on $5 million damages to make sure  nothing like this will ever happen again.

The most recent, Fausto Luna, was an Uber driver who jumped in front of a train at a Manhattan subway station Sept. 26, ABC 7 reports. The other six were yellow cab taxi drivers or drivers for livery or black car services. At a Sunday afternoon vigil for Luna outside the Washington Heights subway station where the 58-year-old died, about two dozen people attended, carrying signs with the names of the dead and criticizing how professional drivers are treated, the New York Times reports. The suicides highlight the troubles faced by drivers for more traditional services as they struggle to compete with the ride-hailing apps flooding the streets with alternate options, but even drivers for Uber and similar companies say they're struggling with low pay and too much competition. Advocates say that for-hire drivers are facing increasing debt even as they work longer shifts.  We are right now in a very deep crisis,  said one taxi driver of more than 26 years who attended the vigil. The executive director of the Black Car Fund, which runs a workers' compensation fund for car-service drivers, says it is partnering with the Independent Drivers Guild  to deliver mental wellness counseling, emergency response, psychologists, social workers and other helpful services directly to drivers.  New York in August became the first major US city to put a temporary cap on new vehicle licenses for ride-hailing services, but there are more than 100,000 for-hire vehicles already in use on the city's streets, compared to 63,000 in 2015.

That goose egg is actually a good thing in the government's perspective. Canada hoarded some 1,000 metric tons of gold in the 1960s but has been slowly selling it and stashing other countries' currencies instead. Canada holds $48.6 billion in US dollars and $22.5 billion in other currencies, reports the Globe and Mail.  The government has a long-standing policy of diversifying its portfolio by selling physical commodities (such as gold) and instead investing in financial assets that are easily tradable and that have deep markets of buyers and sellers,  a Finance Department rep tells the CBC. A former finance official adds that holding onto gold isn't economical because it hasn't had a good rate of return over the years and is costly to store. Clearly not everyone agrees: Russia, India, and China, are shoring up their reserves. Still, one professor suggests the only reason the US Federal Reserve isn't selling its gold is because  it knows it would get attacked in Congress.  Indeed, Ted Cruz is a big fan and has suggested the US return to the gold standard, notes the Globe and Mail.

"(Sep 22, 2020  12:51 PM CDT) Internet trolls, beware: A conspiracy theorist who claimed a politician was involved in a pedophile ring has been ordered to pay more than half a million dollars. Last month, Anne Webster, a first-term Australian MP, and her husband sued Karen Brewer over a series of Facebook posts that claimed Webster was  a member of a secretive pedophile network  who arrived in Parliament  to protect a past generation of pedophiles,  per the Guardian. The posts, which smack of wild QAnon claims, were shared hundreds of times, including on accounts linked to a city within the district Webster represents. On Tuesday, Judge Jacqueline Gleeson ruled the Websters were  entitled to substantial awards of damage  to illustrate the  baselessness  of the  vile  claims, which also targeted the couple's nonprofit. She then ordered Brewer to pay the equivalent of $625,000. Webster and her husband, Phillip, had launched not a pedophile ring, but an organization that supports 150 young mothers, per the Guardian and ABC Australia.  While I consider that rational people would regard Ms. Brewer's publications as delusional, I accept that some people may find them persuasive,  Gleeson wrote in her decision. Brewer was ordered to pay $250,000 to Webster, $160,000 to her husband, and $215,000 to the nonprofit, Zoe Support. Brewer didn't take part in the proceedings and instead has mocked the judge in videos online, per the Guardian. Following the verdict, Webster expressed interest in holding Facebook accountable.  It is a bit of a scary world where people can share whatever they like and it's only by going through legal cases that things can change,  she said, per ABC.","She Claimed Politician Was a Pedophile, Now Owes $625K"
"(Nov 19, 2014  2:17 AM) A baby boy born with four arms and four legs has been nicknamed  God Boy  and drawn thousands of excited people to the city of Baruipur in eastern India. The boy's family is overjoyed because the birth defect makes him resemble a Hindu god, according to the Daily Mail.  The nurses said he was badly deformed, but I could see this was a sign from God,  a relative tells local media.  In fact, this is a miracle, it's God's baby. Indian gods have extra limbs just like this.  A police officer struggling to control the curious crowds, however, says it is  tragic  and that hundreds of people are praying and crying in the streets; some even believe the birth is a sign of the end of the world. The boy's condition is believed to be the result of a  parasitic twin  attached to him in the womb.  With conjoined twins, you have two living fetuses that are attached either by the head, abdomen, or legs,  the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Hackensack University Medical Center tells Fox News. But with a parasitic twin,  it's the same principle, except there is a malformation of one of those twins,  he says.  As a result, the twin never fully develops and is then partially encased in the living fetus.  An eight-limbed girl born in India in 2005 created a similar stir. After a 27-hour operation to sever the twin when she was 2, Lakshmi Tatma was able to walk.",8-Limbed 'God Baby' Draws Crowds in India

"(Jun 16, 2018  7:03 AM CDT) A woman who was nearly killed when two boys tossed a shopping cart from an overpass at a Manhattan mall has just been awarded $45 million. A jury this week awarded 53-year-old Marion Hedges the money seven years after the incident at the East River Plaza Mall left her with severe brain injuries, reports the New York Times. She has partially recovered, though she continues to suffer the effects today, as evidenced by this line in the New York Post: Hedges  shook with emotion when the verdict was announced—but she didn’t shed a tear because a side effect of her brain damage is the inability to cry.  Hedges had been returning to her car in a parking kiosk after shopping for Halloween candy when two boys, ages 12 and 13, dumped a shopping cart from a walkway more than 70 feet above her. The cart struck her in the head. The boys were caught and served time in a juvenile detention facility, but the jury found them only 10% responsible. Jurors deemed the mall 65% responsible and a security company the remaining 25%. Hedges is a philanthropist, and she promises to use part of the money to help kids in the neighborhood.  We want to help Harlem kids have a chance to do something besides throw a shopping cart on a boring Sunday afternoon,  she said. The judge in the case lauded her attitude when the trial was over.  I think you have shown us all how to live in the face of adversity,  said Justice Carmen St. George, per the Post. Specifically, the jury awarded Hedges $40.7 million, her husband $2.5 million, and her son (who was shopping with her that day) $2 million.","Nearly Killed by Shopping Cart, Woman Gets $45M"

"(Oct 4, 2016  3:18 PM CDT) One year after 4Chan founder Christopher  moot  Poole sold the website he had run since he was a teen, the new management is realizing it may not be so easy to run one of the Internet's most infamous communities. New owner Hiroyuki Nishimura posted a note on 4chan itself Sunday, saying  Thank you for thinking about 4chan. We had tried to keep 4chan as is. But I failed. I am sincerely sorry.  Nishimura said the increasing incidence of ad blockers has made it impossible to cover the costs of running the site with the current business model. He suggested three possible fixes: limiting upload sizes and removing boards to thin traffic, adding malicious advertising such as pop-under ads, or increasing the sales of 4Chan premium subscriptions. In the past, 4Chan has been linked to various online hate movements, due to the site's loose moderation and anonymous nature. However, nefarious users have largely migrated off 4Chan to other hidden imageboards, subreddits, and  chans,  meaning a potential closure of the site isn't as big of a story as it once might have been. Nonetheless, 4Chan still has its fans.

If anything, the  open-marriage  interview given by his wife (or Gingrich's defiant reaction to it) seems to have helped him, writes PPP. That may be because only 31% think she's telling the truth.

"(Jun 8, 2012  12:03 AM CDT) A stretch of highway through Texas could soon have the highest officially posted speed limit in the Western hemisphere. State officials are considering an 85mph limit along a portion of new Highway 130 running between San Antonio and Austin. Critics say the speed boost will cost lives, but the state speed management director says the safest roads are ones where all motorists travel the same speed—and studies on the new stretch find most drivers zooming along at 85mph.  The more people we can get to travel a uniform speed, the safer the conditions,  he noted. Texas and Utah are currently the only states with posted speed limits of 80mph on existing roads. If the change goes through, Texas would have second highest posted speed in the world. A few roads in Poland allow 86mph.

"(Apr 17, 2016  6:01 AM CDT) The strongest earthquake to hit Ecuador in decades flattened buildings and buckled highways along its Pacific coast, sending the Andean nation into a state of emergency. As rescue workers rushed in, officials said the damage stretched for hundreds of miles. The magnitude-7.8 quake was centered on Ecuador's sparsely populated fishing ports and tourist beaches. Vice President Jorge Glas later that at least 235 were confirmed dead, with another 1,557 injured, reports the AP. He said there were deaths in the cities of Manta, Portoviejo, and Guayaquil—all several hundred miles from where the quake struck shortly after nightfall. He said the quake was the strongest to hit Ecuador since 1979 and accessing the disaster zone was difficult due to landslides.  We're trying to do the most we can, but there's almost nothing we can do,  said Gabriel Alcivar, mayor of Pedernales, a town of 40,000 near the epicenter. Alcivar pleaded for earth-moving machines and rescue workers as dozens of buildings in the town were flattened, trapping residents among the rubble. He said looting had broken out but authorities were too busy trying to save lives to re-establish order, reports the AP.  This wasn't just a house that collapsed, it was an entire town,  he said. President Rafael Correa declared a national emergency and rushed home from a visit to Rome. Ecuador's Risk Management agency said 10,000 armed forces had been deployed. The USGS originally put the quake at a magnitude of 7.4 then raised it to 7.8. It had a depth of 12 miles.

Anheuser-Busch—which must pay $3.5 million in attorneys' fees to four law firms, plus $5,000 to each of three plaintiffs, reports the St. Louis Post Dispatch—followed several other beer makers when it moved production of Beck’s from Germany to St. Louis in 2012. MillerCoors, for instance, moved production of its Foster’s beer from Australia to Fort Worth in 2010. Court documents show Anheuser-Busch's move reduced costs and delivered a fresher beer. But whereas Foster's began importing its yeast from Australia and hired an Australian brewmaster, Beck’s gave up some of its German ingredients in favor of domestic ones, including water and hops, according to the suit.  We've looked at other cases, and don't think they have the same merit we brought here,  a lawyer says.  We hope the change we have brought through this settlement leads to better practices throughout the market.  (MillerCoors’ Blue Moon faces a similar suit.)",Anheuser-Busch Might Owe You $50
"(Mar 29, 2016  3:40 PM CDT) Meteorologists might be able to predict heat waves on the East Coast up to 50 days in advance by keeping an eye on ocean temperatures far, far away. Scientists writing in Nature Geoscience say they've picked up on a connection: When a particular weather event known as the Pacific Extreme Pattern shows up north of Hawaii, it triggers a chain of events that results in oppressive heat in the East in the not-too-distant future, reports Ars Technica. The researchers noticed the pattern after crunching data from US weather stations going back to 1982, along with corresponding sea surface temperatures. The PEP occurs in a particular region near Hawaii when colder-than-normal water meets warmer-than-normal water, and its presence means that the risk of a heat wave on the East Coast can triple, the scientists write in a news release.  We found that we could go back as far as seven weeks and still predict an increase in the odds of future heat waves,  says researcher Karen McKinnon of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  What's exciting about this is the potential for long-range predictions of individual heat waves that gives society far more notice than current forecasts.  They plan to start using the data to forecast heat waves in May, reports AP. Ideally, cities would be better able to prepare for potentially deadly stretches, like a particularly brutal one in 2012. What's more, scientists hope to use the insight to find more patterns that can predict other extreme weather events.

"(Jun 12, 2020  3:00 AM CDT) Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old protester shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo last week, suffered a brain injury, his lawyer says. Gugino was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after the incident, which led to two officers being charged with assault. After he was shoved, he hit his head on the sidewalk and blood could be seen coming from his ear. His condition was upgraded to fair this week but he remains hospitalized. Attorney Kelly Zarcone says Gugino has started physical therapy and will not be doing media interviews because of the injury.  Martin is a soft spoken but thoughtful and principled man,  Zarcone tells USA Today.  As heartbreaking as it is, his brain is injured and he is well aware of that now.  Associates describe Gugino as a devout Catholic and a passionate advocate for numerous causes. They say President Trump's claim that he was a Antifa provocateur who faked the fall could hardly be further from the truth. For  anyone to make statements that he is a fomenter of violence or any kind of terror is ridiculous,  Victoria Ross, director of the Western New York Peace Center, tells People.  I really have to say his signature characteristic is he is is a devotee of nonviolence.

"(Oct 12, 2016  8:46 AM CDT) Donn Fendler was big national news back in 1939: The 12-year-old got separated from his family on a hike up Maine's highest mountain and became the subject of an increasingly desperate search. As the New York Times recounts, mothers across the US sent his mother prayers via Western Union. Incredibly, nine days after he went missing, an exhausted Fendler found an occupied hunting camp in the woods—about 35 miles from Mount Katahdin—and was returned to civilization. Fendler's story is making headlines again in the wake of his death at age 90 last weekend. His account of how he survived is retold in his children's book Lost on a Mountain in Maine, which the Bangor Daily News notes became required reading for the state's fourth-graders. One smart move: The Boy Scout found a stream and kept following it, his brother tells Maine Public Radio.  There were plenty of times I wanted to give up and just say the heck with it,  Fendler himself recalled in the documentary Finding Donn Fendler.  Like those last few days. But you just keep going. Like I told you, it’s your will to live.  Along the way, he lost his jeans and his shoes, fell down an embankment, and was feasted upon by mosquitoes. Prior to finding the hunting camp,  he came across an old cabin and there was a potato sack in there and a few other things that he could use,  says his brother.  But he ate berries and drank water and really didn’t have anything to eat, and he was below 70 pounds when they found him.

"(Feb 25, 2013  8:25 AM) Two lawmakers are battling against what they deem an unnecessary tool of war: the Selective Service System—the organization that keeps records for any future draft. Reps. Peter DeFazio (a Democrat) and Mike Coffman (a Republican) say the success of the all-volunteer force has rendered the agency moot, and that the $24 million spent annually to maintain the draft is a waste. And DeFazio argues it's only persisted this long because politicians fear they'll look weak on national security if they push for its demise. But the AP calls the men's campaign  little noticed.  With its eye on the draft, the AP today circles back to the question of whether women should now be required to sign up. Though the Selective Service System itself issued a statement saying  the law has not been changed to include this,  legal experts say the law won't be on women's side for long. In a 1981 Supreme Court ruling, justices said it was constitutional to exclude women because they weren't allowed to serve in combat roles. Now that that's changed, it'll be tough to argue against women's registration, says a law professor and ex-Air Force officer.  They're going to have to show that excluding women from the draft actually improves military readiness,  she notes.

"(Dec 12, 2014  3:28 PM) A gunman opened fire today on several young people outside an alternative high school in Portland, Oregon, wounding four and fleeing on foot with two other people, police tell the AP. The victims are all students at Rosemary Anderson High School or in affiliated job programs: a 16-year-old girl in critical condition; two males, 17 and 20, in serious condition; a 20-year-old male in serious condition; and a 19-year-old female who was lightly grazed and treated on the scene. The father of a fifth victim, a 16-year-old girl, tells the Oregonian that his daughter is in surgery. Police suspect the shooting is gang-related and say a dispute may have erupted before the bullets started flying. Eye-witness accounts are piecemeal so far, with one student saying she saw a male victim lying on the ground with  blood coming out of his stomach. It was scary.  Another says a male student ran into the school holding open his coat and yelling,  Oh my god, did I just get shot?

This sanitary: Water Bureau administrators are willing to flush 38 million gallons of the stuff and clean the open-air reservoir in order to make sure there's not the most miniscule amount of human urine in it. The Oregonian reports that a 19-year-old man peed in Mt. Tabor Reservoir 5, which supplies the city with drinking water, around 1am yesterday. He was caught on surveillance video leaning against a fence in order to  get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,  said Water Bureau administrator David Shaff; the man then pulled up his pants seconds later. That was apparently enough of a leak for the city to step in.  Even though there is very minimal public health risk, the bottom line is that our commitment is to serve water that’s clean, cold, and constant. That doesn’t include pee. Not from people, at least,  said Shaff, who acknowledges that animals routinely urinate, or worse, in the water. Also caught on video: The man and his cohorts took selfies at the scene. The group of three was later stopped by officers and given trespassing citations along with, in the case of the pee-er, a public urination citation. The pipes to the reservoir, which holds treated water, were then immediately closed, and the water was tested; the results, due today, aren't expected to show any contamination. The AP notes the water will be drained into the sewage system that eventually dumps into the Columbia River. The same thing happened in 2011 at the Mt.

Named Jaxson, the reptile had lived there for 37 years. Jaxson was soon transported to the Los Angeles Zoo, where its health was being evaluated, reports the Los Angeles Times. Homeowner Laura Mattson says that her husband bought the gator as a baby in 1977, and that she and her brother, Ron Gorecki, have looked after it since her husband died two years ago.  We tried to give him a good home,  says Gorecki. Of his brother-in-law he says,  He loved (the alligator), it was his pride and joy.  The gator's presence, he says, was an open secret.

They’re basically saying we’re taking the animals and feeding them to the alligator, and that’s not true,  Gorecki tells CBS. The siblings say they also took care of neutered feral cats brought to them by a rescue group, but they never fed them to Jaxson. Mattson and Gorecki did not have a permit for the alligator, according to animal control. The search followed a local resident's report of seeing the gator, though Jaxson somehow eluded officers on an initial visit in August.

So investigators exhumed her body three months later, sent her fingers to the Wellington Fingerprints Branch, and reburied her, reports stuff.co.nz. The circumstances surrounding her case remain mysterious, and for decades her fingers were held in the care of New Zealand Police Forensics Collection, used to demonstrate how to care for post-mortem remains. In the 1990s, as forensics procedures evolved, the fingers were sent to the New Zealand Police Museum, and now, at long last, they have been reunited with Fendell in a small ceremony by the sea.

A study in PLoS ONE suggests the creatures can detect rainstorms happening 150 miles away, possibly by hearing them even from that far off. Migrating elephants are known to change direction out of the blue, and researchers haven't been certain why. The Namibian research team figured it might be because of rain—as Phys.org explains, elephants are regularly looking for water in the region, which is dry outside of the January-to-March rainy season. Researchers placed GPS devices on elephants in 14 different herds for seven years. Meanwhile, they kept track of rainfall in the region. They found that changes in the elephants' movements were associated with the direction of rain.  We don’t know if they can actually hear the thunder or if they are detecting other low-frequency sounds generated by the storms that humans can’t hear,  a researcher says, as the tamuTimes reports.  But there is no doubt they know what direction the rain is.

The ensuing hole caused the ship to sink, but it took 15 minutes to do so, giving the entire crew time to board the very ship that caused the Nisbet Grammer's downfall. The May 31, 1926, event may have faded out of memory if not for its new claim to fame: It's now the largest shipwreck ever found in Lake Ontario, reports the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, and its discovery is the result of a fairly long quest. Jim Kennard used the Nisbet Grammer's detailed ship log to pinpoint where the wreck could be, and thought he might be able to zero in on it in an afternoon.

It puts the count at 196 Democrats, with 30 senators and 166 representatives listed as plaintiffs in a suit filed in federal court that accuses Trump of violating the Constitution. The  emoluments clause  is what's at play here, just as in the suit filed Monday by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, DC. The clause requires Trump to obtain an OK from Congress before accepting payments or gifts from outside governments, and those suing him argue that his businesses have taken in a multitude of payments from foreign governments since his inauguration—absent that approval. The Washington Post reports Connecticut's Sen. Richard Blumenthal led the filing for the Senate, and he invited Republicans to join in (none have done so). His take:  The president’s failure to tell us about these emoluments ... [means] that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don’t know.  University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal tells the Post their chances of success don't look great:  Because this is individual legislators who don’t have any individual injuries, it will be hard for them to get standing.

The deaths that resulted from the helicopter-driven assault are the latest reminder of the US struggle in the isolated Kunar province. The US has lately shifted its attention away from the region—one of Afghanistan’s most violent since 2005—concentrating instead on population centers. The assault took place near Pakistan's tribal areas, over which its government has little sway. Last summer, the same battalion killed some 150 fighters in the region; afterward, the US attempted to build an Afghan police station there. But when American troops left the area, so did the police.  The police were too scared the Taliban were going to come back and kill them,  said a US commander.

"(Dec 9, 2013  3:30 PM) The US government ended up losing $10.5 billion on its bailout of General Motors, but still says the alternative would have been much worse. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced today that the government sold its remaining shares in the Detroit automaker. The government received 912 million GM shares, or a 60.8% stake, in exchange for a $49.5 billion bailout during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. It recovered $39 billion of the money, meaning taxpayers came up more than $10 billion short. But Lew says the rescue was necessary to save a million jobs and stop the American auto industry from collapsing. GM shares rose 1.2% in after-hours trading following the announcement and at one point in regular trading reached $41.17, the highest level since GM returned to the markets with a November 2010 initial public offering. Earlier today, Mark Reuss, GM's North American president, told reporters in Warren, Mich., that a government exit would boost sales, especially among pickup truck buyers. GM has said repeatedly that some potential customers have stayed away because the government intervened in a private company's finances.

Angry mobs then pulled out the train driver and beat him—Yadav says the driver was killed, but Kumar says he's in hospital in critical condition. The mob then got all the passengers out of the train and set some coaches on fire. Groups of young men also smashed the windows of two other trains that were in the station. A crowd of around 5,000 people gathered near the station and were chasing away the district officials who tried to remove the bodies from the tracks.

The Argentine black-and-white tegu, which reaches up to 4 feet long, is believed to have spread through south Florida after escaping captivity or being intentionally released more than a decade ago. But now they're beginning to reach other states. They are thought to inhabit at least two counties in Georgia and four in South Carolina, per National Geographic and Discover. There have also been more isolated sightings in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. That's bad news for crops and native species. As National Geographic reports, the omnivores will eat  just about anything with nutritional value they can fit in their mouth,  from low-growing fruits and vegetables to small animals. Native to South America, they're also known to munch on the eggs of ground-nesting animals, like endangered sea turtles. In Venezuela, they've been dubbed  the chicken wolf  for a habit of stealing eggs from chicken coops. When not hunting for food, tegus are docile, making them desirable pets. More than 79,000 were imported from South America between 2000 and 2010, according to Amy Yackel Adams, a biologist with the US Geological Survey. It's unclear how many tegus are now living in the US. But one trapper in south Florida tells WSVN that he's caught 1,800 just this year. If many more escape captivity or are let loose by owners,  there is the potential for a very large population in the wild,  Adams tells National Geographic. She adds  the entire southeast portion of the United States  offers a suitable habitat and is therefore at risk.",4-Foot-Long Lizard Is Spreading in Southeast US
"(Oct 31, 2017  9:30 AM CDT) Almost eight years after their daughter's car was found abandoned in Detroit, a Georgia couple held out hope that the missing woman would be found alive. It was hope that should've been dashed within months. The body of Crissita Cage-Toaster was pulled from the Detroit River in March 2010, five months after the 28-year-old vanished, per the AP. But though the woman was black, Detroit police and the coroner determined her body belonged to a white or Hispanic woman. It was labeled  Jane Doe 10-3047,  held in a coroner's cooler for a year, then buried with other unidentified remains in an unmarked cemetery grave, a cause of death never established, reports MLive. Rosita Cage-Toaster, 58, and her husband, Johnny Toaster, 64, say authorities only informed them of  a mix-up  a month ago, a few months after the couple asked a missing-persons group for help in the case, per WXYZ. Police now say months in the river had affected their daughter's complexion, but the couple wonders how a large tattoo of a red rose on their daughter's right shoulder wasn't a clear giveaway.  I kept telling them to focus on that tattoo,  says Cage-Toaster, per MLive.  You could give this to an elementary school student and they could figure out the puzzle.

Those views—and quite a few others—are catching up to him. The Democratic Party of Orange County wants Wayne's name removed from the California airport that has carried it since 1979, the year the Hollywood icon died. The Democrats' resolution cited Wayne's  racist and bigoted statements,  per TMZ. Other efforts to change the signs in Santa Ana have gone nowhere, including one last year after the Playboy interview recirculated on Twitter, per Newsweek. Wayne, a committed opponent of Communism, was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Wayne's disparaging comments in the interview were wide-ranging. He referred to the gay characters in the film Midnight Cowboy with a homophobic slur. There was nothing wrong with seizing land from Native Americans, he said:  There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.  The airport was built on an old Army base, and the area also had a couple of major air bases. A oped in the Orange County Register said the area has been home to plenty of heroes who would better a better choice for an airport name. Their stories better express the county's values, state Sen.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest numbers Monday, and those numbers reveal that so far this year at least 704 people have come down with the viral infection, the Washington Post reports. That's the highest single-year tally since 1994, which saw 963 cases, per the AP. Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. More than 500 of the people infected this year were not vaccinated, and about 75% of the cases are in children or teenagers. No deaths have been reported, but 66 people have been hospitalized.  Vaccine-preventable diseases belong in the history books, not in our emergency rooms,  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  The suffering we are seeing today is completely avoidable.  Gizmodo notes that people born before 1989—when people got one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, as opposed to the more modern two doses—might consider getting another shot.

But it got some relief this week when a couple paid $40,000 for a single bottle of bourbon, per WFLA. The owners, Suzanne Perry and husband Roger, had opted to sell off pricey liquor to avoid going under. The most valuable was a bottle of 25-year-aged Pappy Van Winkle Kentucky bourbon, one of just 710 produced, which Perry listed at the discounted price of $17,000. A couple eventually agreed to buy the bottle over the phone, while asking probing questions about the state of affairs at Datz. And when they showed up, they handed over a check for more than twice the asking price. Perry's husband thought the check was a mistake and tried to return it. But the anonymous buyer, a local philanthropist and veteran,  said, 'No, I want you to have it, and I want you to use it for your staff,'  Perry tells the Tampa Bay Times.

A dolphin that has resided in Ireland's Dingle Bay for nearly four decades has up and vanished, and residents aren't just missing him for sentimental reasons (though there's that, too)—Fungie had become a vital part of the local economy. Euronews reports that the bottlenose dolphin, who showed up in the bay's waters in 1983 and is believed to be in his mid-40s, has spurred a thriving sightseeing industry, with a dozen or so companies offering boat tours for a chance to spot him. He also holds the Guinness record for the oldest solitary dolphin in the world, per the Telegraph. Fishermen usually have Fungie sightings every few hours, but he disappeared completely last week. Kevin Flannery, the director of a nearby aquarium, says Fungie was last spotted frolicking with some humpback whales and that it's possible Fungie simply took off with them, or perhaps left Dingle Bay in search of a  different environment,  per Euronews. Or, Flannery notes, because the life span of dolphins in the wild is only about 50 years, there could be a more somber reason that Fungie is gone.

"(Mar 12, 2019  5:18 PM CDT) The US is still flying Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, despite a growing number of nations grounding them following two crashes in less than five months. (NPR is keeping track of the countries and airlines that have grounded the planes so far.) But airline pilots on at least two US flights say they have indeed experienced problems flying that type of aircraft, the AP reports. Though official causes have not yet been determined for either October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia or Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash—and no link between the two has been confirmed—many have theorized the plane's anti-stall system played a role. In both crashes, the planes noses tilted down suddenly. And in two safety reports filed voluntarily last year, which do not publicly reveal airline, pilot name, or location, two US pilots reported having that same issue. In the two US cases, the pilots said that soon after engaging autopilot, the nose tilted down sharply; autopilot was disconnected in both instances and the pilots recovered quickly. The captain in one report wrote that  with the concerns with the MAX 8 nose down stuff, we both thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention,  and theorized a brief weather system overwhelmed the plane's automation and led to an  airspeed fluctuation ; in the other report, the co-pilot wrote that he and the pilot  can't think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively.  It was not clear whether the airlines or the FAA took any action after the incidents.

"(Sep 16, 2020  7:53 AM CDT) As regulators get closer to OKing recertification for Boeing's beleaguered 737 Max planes, what CNBC calls a  damning  report from a Congressional committee that took a year and a half to complete was released Wednesday, pointing to a series of fails during the development of the aircraft. The nearly 250-page document from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure lays out design, regulatory, and management missteps and  disturbing cultural issues,  including placing  undue pressure  on employees. The two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, and which prompted the grounding of the plane in March of last year,  were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA,  the report reads. The Democrat-led committee's report, which the New York Times says came from 600,000 pages of records and interviews with dozens of Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration workers, accuses the FAA of not stepping in enough to provide oversight, and Boeing of prioritizing profits over safety—specifically so that it could stay on top of rival Airbus, which had a competing aircraft. In a statement cited by CNN, Boeing responded to the report by saying it has  learned many hard lessons as a company  and that once regulators give the plane the OK to fly again,  we have full confidence in its safety.  Others aren't so sure.  I think the project as a whole should be scrapped,  a woman whose husband was killed on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, tells CNBC.

He was 87. Grass was lauded by Germans for helping to revive their culture in the aftermath of World War II and helping to give voice and support to democratic discourse in the postwar nation. Yet he provoked the ire of many in 2006 when he revealed in his memoir that, as a teenager, he had served in the Waffen-SS, the combat arm of Adolf Hitler's notorious paramilitary organization. A trained sculptor, Grass made his literary reputation with The Tin Drum, published in 1959. Combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images, his work captured the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the horrors of the war, and the guilt that lingered after Adolf Hitler's defeat. Three decades after its release, in 1999, the Swedish Academy honored Grass with the Nobel Prize for literature, praising him for setting out to revive German literature after the Nazi era.

Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido tells a news conference today that Guzman used an elaborate escape hatch built allegedly without the detection of authorities. The hatch featured a ladder, reports the Economist, which connected to the ventilated, lighted tunnel, where a motorbike on rails awaited; Guzman had previously escaped prison in 2001, and was reportedly slipped out while hidden in a laundry cart.

"(Apr 30, 2018  9:20 AM CDT) Harvard researchers say five things will help you live longer, and the list isn't all that surprising: exercise, eat a healthy diet, maintain a healthy body weight, don't drink too much, and don't smoke. More surprising is just how much of an effect those five combined factors have on longevity—an extra 14 years for women and 12 for men, according to the study in Circulation. Researchers looked at about 30 years of data on more than 78,000 women and 44,000 men and found that those who were five-for-five on the aforementioned list had a significantly better life expectancy at age 50 than those who didn't abide by any of the healthy habits. For women, it meant an additional 43 years for the healthiest group, compared to 29 years. For men, it meant an additional 37.6 years, compared to 25.5 years.  When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer,  says co-author Meir Stampfer, per the Guardian.  But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was.  The two big factors: Those with the healthiest lifestyles were less likely to get cancer or heart disease, notes CNN. The Harvard Gazette provides some specifics: Researchers defined regular exercise as 30 minutes or more per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity; moderate drinking is roughly one 5-ounce glass of wine per day for women and up to two for men; and the target body-mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9. Scientists say they undertook the study to better understand why the US has a shorter life expectancy (79.3 years) than most high-income countries. (Another study says it's all about eating smaller portions.)",5 Lifestyle Habits Have 'Huge Effect' on Longevity
"(Feb 11, 2016  9:59 AM) Marco Rubio is finally explaining his rough performance in the last Republican debate that earned him the nickname  Robot Rubio.   I just pivoted to my message because I didn't want to be involved in a scrum,  he said Wednesday, per Politico. Though his plan to spin skirmishes with fellow Republicans into attacks on President Obama or Hillary Clinton didn't work as planned, he says he's only performed poorly in .05 of the eight Republican debates.  In 7.95 of those debates I did very well. I had a bad incident at the beginning of this debate. And it clouded everything else we talked about,  he said.  It's on me. So we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Prior to the debate, friends were predicting a Rubio victory in New Hampshire. Afterward, aides admitted it hadn't been Rubio's finest performance. But it was Rubio's own perusal of the  brutal, mocking reviews  on Twitter that showed him  the damage he had done,  reports the New York Times. Mocked for repeating the same  25-second speech,  Rubio managed only a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire. Congressional Republicans are now questioning his readiness and level of experience, reports the Hill, but Rubio still thinks he'll come out on top.  It is just going to take a little longer,  he says. Since no major donors are walking out,  right now, there's no panic,  a supporter says.

"(Nov 12, 2018  1:17 PM) Stan Lee, the co-creator of Marvel Comics, is dead at 95, Lee's daughter tells TMZ. The gossip site reports an ambulance was called to Lee's Hollywood Hills home early Monday and he died at a nearby medical center. His cause of death is not yet clear, but TMZ notes that he's been sick several times over the past year, including with pneumonia. Condolences were pouring out on Twitter for Lee, who created such iconic characters as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Iron Man, and the Avengers.  My father loved all of his fans. He was the greatest, most decent man,  his daughter tells TMZ. Celebrities who've played Marvel characters were mourning Lee too; Hugh Jackman, aka Wolverine, tweeted that the world lost a  pioneering force in the superhero universe  while Chris Evans, aka Captain America, noted,  There will never be another Stan Lee.  Lee started working in comics in 1939, first as a gofer at Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. He ultimately rose to editor, and Marvel ultimately became the No. 1 comic book publisher in the world—not to mention its eventual forays into TV and movies. Starting in the 1960s, Lee's comic book characters started to diverge from their DC Comics counterparts: Rather than featuring perfect superheroes, Lee imbued his with all-too-human issues. (See, for example, the love troubles experienced by Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.) And starting in the 1970s, Lee included such serious topics in his comics as drug abuse. The Hollywood Reporter adds that his last few years have been  tumultuous  and included the death of his wife in 2017, a number of lawsuits filed by him, and reports of elder abuse against him.

Buried in Italy's Hotel Rigopiano after an avalanche struck on Jan. 18, the couple huddled together, their heads less than two feet from the collapsed ceiling, and ate snow before rescuers pulled them out by their feet on Saturday, report the New York Times and the AP. Galassi says their survival was  truly a miracle.  Only nine people survived inside the hotel—in addition to three puppies—while two others were found alive in a car outside, per CNN. Officials say 29 others died. Autopsies conducted on six bodies show some victims were crushed immediately, while others died of hypothermia and asphyxiation, a prosecutor says. Francesca Bronzi's boyfriend, who was celebrating his birthday, was among those killed. But Bronzi was luckily confined to a small cavity near Galassi, 25, and Forti, 22, who helped boost her morale. The couple recalls guests gathering in the hotel lobby after earthquakes shook the building. Then the avalanche struck, burying the hotel in 60,000 tons of snow, rock, and uprooted trees.  It all started from a rumble. And then everything collapsed  in  a roar,  Forti says.  We couldn't see anything, it was total darkness,  adds Galassi.

"(Nov 16, 2015  5:20 AM) The attacks in Paris have prompted the governors of several US states to declare that Syrian refugees aren't welcome. The governors of Alabama and Michigan each issued statements Sunday to that effect, reports the Washington Post. And on Monday, the governors of Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Ohio, Wisconsin, Georgia, and New Hampshire said the same, notes the Daily Beast. The issue is resonating particularly strongly in Michigan, which already has accepted about 200 and is home to what the Detroit Free Press calls one of the biggest Mideast populations in the nation.  Michigan is a welcoming state and we are proud of our rich history of immigration,  said Gov. Rick Snyder.  But our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents.  He said the state would suspend its push to bring in refugees until the Homeland Security department conducts a review of procedures in the wake of the Paris attacks. In Alabama, Gov. Robert Bentley said he intends to keep the number of Syrian refugees to zero.  After full consideration of this weekend's attacks of terror on innocent citizens in Paris, I will oppose any attempt to relocate Syrian refugees to Alabama through the US Refugee Admissions Program,  he said.  As your Governor, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way.  One of the State Department's refugee processing centers is in Alabama, and it isn't clear how Bentley plans to stop Syrians from being resettled in the state, NBC News reports.

"(May 22, 2018  10:00 AM CDT) The debate over MH370's demise rages on, this time in the Australian Senate, where an official with the country's Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) threw cold water on a recently pushed theory. In an episode of Australia's 60 Minutes, experts alleged that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah intentionally crashed the plane and that those aboard weren't conscious when he did so. They suggested he depressurized the aircraft by rapidly changing its altitude to inflict hypoxia on the passengers and crew but remained conscious himself using an emergency air supply, then repressurized the plane for the remainder of the journey. Both the ATSB and Malaysian officials say Zaharie was unconscious when the flight went down, and the ATSB's Peter Foley used the example of a 1994 flight as reported by the US National Transportation Safety Board in attempting to dispel the theory. The Guardian has his quote:  During the climbout [of the 1994 flight] the flight crew was unable to pressurize the aircraft, and the captain elected to proceed with the flight. The crew donned their oxygen masks and shortly thereafter the captain became incapacitated from decompression sickness. The first officer took command and they landed the plane. The pilot in this particular aircraft was 51 and overweight. The pilot in command of MH370 was 53 and overweight. I'm not saying that happened and I hate to speculate, but that is one plausible scenario.  The Australian Associated Press reports Foley said Zaharie would have had to battle the effects of decompression sickness for as long as an hour, and that doing so just wasn't likely.","Aussie Official Spurns Theory, Cites MH370 Pilot's Weight"

The Georgia boy has been friends for years with 12-year-old Gabby Ruiz of Florida, where he used to live, and they've stayed pals despite the distance, per WFTS. When the two kids first started playing together, Tyler was curious why Gabby always wore head coverings, and his parents filled him in on her condition: alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the head and other parts of the body. Gabby had gone through myriad treatments to spur hair growth, but none of them had worked, which got Tyler thinking about how he could help his friend. His solution: He'd grow his own hair out so that Gabby could make a wig out of it.  It's just hair, I can grow hair,  he said at the time, per his mom. And so for two years Tyler let his hair grow down to his shoulders, shrugging off bullies and being mistaken for a girl.  I'm used to it now,  he says, per KTLA.  I just want to make her happy.

According to a study published in Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences, people turning an age that ends in 9 are more likely to take up positive habits, but they may also cheat on their mates and even be more apt to commit suicide, the Washington Post reports. That's because the approaching round-numbered ages (e.g., the big 3-0 or 4-0) are  psychologically consequential  and cause us to take a long, hard look at what we've been doing up to that point and recalibrate, Hal Hershfield, one of the study's co-authors, tells the Post. People want a do-over when they hit certain temporal landmarks like birthdays or New Year's Day—what a study published in Management Science calls the  fresh start effect.  In the new research, scientists analyzed six studies and found that people the Post refers to as  nine-enders  are more likely to question how meaningful their lives are, and are more likely to increase both constructive and destructive behaviors, the NYU Stern School of Business reports. Men who were 29, 39, 49, and 59, for example, were more likely to register on an extramarital affair-focused website, while suicide rates for nine-enders were 2.4% higher than for others. On the flip side, first-time marathon runners were more likely to have an age ending in 9 (25%), and runners who were 29 and 39 had a 2% faster running rate than they did two years before and after those ages. The research underscores the powerful psychological pull that numbers can wield. (Death rates overall seem to spike on birthdays.)","Birthdays Ending in 9 Make Us Cheat, Run, Die"

The memorial's website says the fees are needed to  safely manage visitor capacity,  and claims the nonprofit receives no federal, state, or city funding. Yet the memorial has hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded grants and private donations in recent years—and dished out six-figure salaries to some employees. Meanwhile, it faces construction costs now pegged at $700 million.

"(Mar 31, 2014  12:17 PM CDT) A firefighter put his reptile-handling experience to good use when he rescued a 6-foot-long python from a burning home in western Michigan last night. Muskegon firefighter Scott Hemmelsbach told the Muskegon Chronicle that he reluctantly agreed to enter the two-story, smoke-filled house to retrieve the snake. He says he cradled the  weighty  snake before carrying it to safety.  It was trying to crawl up the side of his terrarium,  Hemmelsbach said.  His face was pushed up on the screen and trying to get out. There was a lot of smoke and he was trapped.  The firefighter said he learned how to handle snakes while he was in high school, where he helped showcase them.  I'd take them around and show them to the kids in the elementary classes,  he said. When Hemmelsbach reached the python inside the home, he gingerly handled him so not to scare the reptile.  I removed the screen off the top and knew to approach it by coming up behind his head. He became very active, and I was glad because that meant that he was OK.  The fire significantly damaged the home, and the cause is under investigation.  I would do it for any creature,  Hemmelsbach said.  I'm just glad it had a happy ending.  (Click to read about another unusual animal rescue.)",Firefighter Pulls 6-Foot Python From Blaze
"(Jul 9, 2016  2:31 PM CDT) Former model Christina Estrada made history Friday when she received a stunning $97 million divorce settlement from a British court, the Telegraph reports. And even that was less than half what she was asking. The settlement includes cash and assets from her ex, Saudi businessman Walid Juffali, and is the largest in English history.  This is what I am accustomed to,  the Guardian quotes Estrada as telling the judge.  It is difficult to convey the extraordinary level of luxury and opulence we were fortunate enough to enjoy.  Estrada's initial request included annual payments of $152,000 for handbags, $780,000 for renting private jets, $107,000 for cocktail dresses, and more. The court says the final settlement meets Estrada's  reasonable needs.  Estrada, a US citizen, says she knows how all this is  perceived in the wider world.   Having grown up in a middle-class family … I am fully aware that the spectacular life Walid and I led was immensely fortunate and rarefied,  the Guardian quotes the former model as saying in a statement. In 2012, Juffali secretly married a 25-year-old model with whom he started a family (Islamic law allows Muslim men to have multiple spouses). Two years later, he divorced Estrada, again without her knowledge. Estrada's lawyers had argued Juffali is worth $10 billion, but the 61-year-old businessman, who is currently being treated for terminal cancer, claims it's more like $147 million, the New York Daily News reports.

"(Apr 30, 2014  3:20 PM CDT) Al Feldstein, whose 28 years at the helm of Mad magazine transformed the satirical publication into a pop culture institution, has died at his Montana home at age 88. In 1956, publisher William M. Gaines put Feldstein in charge of the magazine, which gleefully parodied politicians and mocked traditional morality. Feldstein and Gaines assembled a pool of artists and writers who turned out such enduring features as  Spy vs. Spy,  ''The Lighter Side of...  and  Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.  Building on a character used by Mad founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Feldstein turned the freckle-faced Alfred E. Neuman into an underground hero—a dimwitted everyman with a gap-toothed smile and the recurring stock phrase,  What, Me Worry?  Under Gaines and Feldstein, Mad's sales flourished, topping 2 million in the early 1970s. In a 1997 interview with the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Feldstein credited Mad's challenges to authority with helping incite the cultural revolution of the 1960s.  Who's covering up? That was one of our slogans,  he said.  We were orienting them to the adult world.  By Feldstein's retirement in 1984, Mad's heyday was past: Circulation had dropped to less than a third of its peak.",Mad Magazine's Al Feldstein Dead at 88

Several firefighters were treated for burns and one was hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The US Forest Service says the Nacimiento Station in the Los Padres National Forest was destroyed. Elsewhere in the state, helicopters rescued more than 100 campers, hikers, and others trapped in Sierra National Forest by the Creek fire, reports the Los Angeles Times. Another 200 were rescued over the weekend.

"(Apr 16, 2019  4:44 PM CDT) Columbine is on lockout, and it's not alone. Over 20 other schools in Jefferson County, Colo., also restricted access Tuesday as officials investigated what they called a  credible threat,  the Denver Post reports. The FBI is leading the probe with help from the county sheriff and area police forces.  We too are taking this threat seriously,  Aurora police tweeted.  ...we are increasing police presence at our schools.  Law enforcement requested the lockout after a  suspicious person  was seen in the area, says a rep for JeffCo Public schools. The move comes four days before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, which left 12 students and one teacher dead on April 20, 1999. A lockout—which restricts school access and forces students to stay inside—is less dire than a lockdown, which is designed to protect students from a threat inside the school. But Colorado schools are also seeing more lockdowns as students report more possible threats in the age of mass shootings:  It's become as routine as fire drills,  a Denver Public Schools offical tells the Post.  We don’t have many students that have started their academic career with us who aren't used to lockdowns.

If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling and the US defaults, the value of that investment would skyrocket—in fact, it’s already up 3.3% since Cantor walked away from negotiations on Thursday, Jonathan Easley of Salon writes. The investment makes up a relatively small part of the millionaire congressman’s assets, and a spokesman stresses that Cantor also holds a lot of Treasury bonds.

Of those likely to vote, 30% said they support Romney, an increase from last month’s 21%. Sarah Palin, who still hasn't said if she's in or out, managed to grab second place—albeit a distant second, at 14%. When Palin was removed from the equation and the options narrowed to six names, Romney's support jumped to 43%. The poll of 1,000 adults was conducted June 9 to 13, which was the evening of this week's big debate. Despite Romney’s GOP domination, President Obama still led him 49% to 43% in the poll. Obama’s approval rating dropped back to April's number, 49%, and 46% said they disapprove of the job he’s doing. A whopping 62% said the US is not on the right track; all of those numbers suggest a very tight re-election fight, says a pollster. Overall, 45% said they would probably re-elect Obama, while 40% would vote for a Republican.

"(Mar 17, 2016  1:17 AM CDT) Five deputies in Fayetteville, NC, are paying the price for failing to act when a protester was punched during a Donald Trump rally. The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office says the five officers—who tackled protester Rakeem Jones instead of the man who sucker-punched him as he was led out of the Crown Coliseum—have been reprimanded and placed on probationary status for a year for  unsatisfactory performance and failing to discharge the duties and policies  of the department, ABC News reports. Three of them were demoted in rank and suspended without pay for five days, while another two were suspended for three days.  The actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will not ever be tolerated under the policies of this office,  Sheriff Moose Butler said, per the Fayetteville Observer. He said that when deciding the punishment, his office took into account the  past bravery and exemplary conduct  of the deputies. John McGraw, 78, has been charged with assault and disorderly conduct for allegedly punching Jones.

"(Dec 29, 2011  8:39 AM) This year will ring out as one of the deadliest for elephants since ivory sales were banned more than two decades ago. Officials seized tusks from a record 2,500 elephants, and while some of those could be from long-dead animals, the news still isn't good.  As most large-scale ivory seizures fail to result in any arrests, I fear the criminals are winning,  says an expert from wildlife trade monitor TRAFFIC. Most experts look directly to the East in laying the blame.  The escalation in ivory trade and elephant and rhino killing is being driven by the Asian syndicates that are now firmly enmeshed within African societies,  the expert tells the AP. Exact numbers are difficult to obtain, since there are also other ivory shipments that make it through undetected, but the Environmental Investigation Agency says that 50 elephants are killed each month in Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve alone.

"(Jul 29, 2016  1:29 AM CDT) Indonesia executed four people convicted of drug crimes on Friday despite international protests and said it would decide later when as many as 10 others are put to death. The men were executed by firing squad not long after midnight local time as torrential rains hit the Nusa Kambangan prison island where the death row inmates were held, the AP reports. The government had said earlier in the week that 14 people on death row, mostly foreigners, would be executed for drug crimes. Those executed were Indonesian Freddy Budiman and Nigerians Seck Osmane, Michael Titus, and Humphrey Jefferson. Lawyers and rights groups had raised serious doubts about the legitimacy of the conviction of Jefferson, who had been in prison for more than a decade. Relatives, rights groups, and foreign governments had urged Indonesia to spare all 14 lives, but it was unclear whether that had any influence on the decision to not carry out all the executions at once. This was the third set of executions under President Joko  Jokowi  Widodo, who was elected in 2014 and campaigned on promises to improve human rights in Indonesia. Last year, his government executed 14 people convicted of drug crimes, mostly foreigners, sparking a huge outcry abroad and particularly in Australia, which had two citizens among those condemned.

"(Sep 15, 2020  3:28 PM CDT) The United States Postal Service says a first-class letter should land in the recipient's mailbox in one to three business days. The Los Angeles Times set out to see if that's really the case these days. In what it calls a  small but revealing  test of the service's current reliability, it tracked 100 letters mailed from 20 Los Angeles County post offices between Aug. 21 and 24 (the period over which Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before Congress) to California destinations as well as Austin, Atlanta, and Washington. The upshot: About half ended up being delayed.  Postal performance in the summer of 2020 is spotty at best, dismal at worst,  concludes the paper, which lays the blame not in one place but outlines  multiple choke points [that] can slow a letter’s journey.  The USPS endeavors to have letters sent to the aforementioned out-of-state destinations arrive in three business days, says Gaare Davis, the head of the American Postal Workers Union, California. The paper describes one letter reaching Austin in 11 days; another in 8. In the case of three letters sent to Washington, it took them each three days to get from the processing center to the house—just one mile away. Of the letters that were to arrive within two business days, 75% managed to get there in that window. That's a big drop from the 92.4% on-time delivery rate the USPS recorded in Q2, per the paper. Davis called the findings  unacceptable.

The total lays to rest speculation that Obama was in for another down month after raising  only  $30 million in April and $21.9 million in May.

Her sister, Claire—three months pregnant herself—immediately moved from Boston to New York City to take care of Gorayeb's daughter, was quickly appointed her niece's legal guardian, and started the process of adopting her in 2004. But nearly a decade later, she's still fighting to adopt the girl, now 14. DNAinfo explains why: Edward Kranz, the banker whose fling with Catherine Gorayeb resulted in her pregnancy, showed a sudden interest in his daughter after learning in 2004 that her mother died in the Twin Towers—despite the fact that he had initially denied fathering the girl, then gave up his custody rights in January 2000 so that he wouldn't have to pay child support after a DNA test showed he was likely the father. In addition to Kranz, a further complication involves a court-appointed guardian who has been scrutinizing how Claire Gorayeb used the nearly $2 million her niece was awarded from the 9/11 victims compensation fund: $900,000 was spent on an Upper West Side apartment (it's in both her and her niece's name). DNAinfo notes that less than two weeks after the girl was awarded the money, Kranz, who filed for bankruptcy that same year, resurfaced. He explains his long absence by saying he hadn't planned on reaching out to her til she turned five. Today, Kranz and Gorayeb will both be in Manhattan Surrogate's Court for a best interest hearing; Kranz says the adoption shouldn't go forward because Gorayeb hasn't allowed him to visit his child.",Inside the Messy Fight to Adopt a 9/11 Victim's Child

"(Oct 29, 2008  1:29 PM CDT) The Federal Reserve surprised no one today, cutting interest rates by half a point, to 1%—as investors widely predicted he would, AP reports.  The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures,  the Fed said in a statement, with the financial crisis  likely to exert additional restraint on spending.  Though the move takes the target rate to 1%, its lowest since 2004, some say the effect may be slight, because the Fed is now paying banks interest on excess reserves deposited at the Fed.  The Fed funds rate is almost irrelevant,  said one economist.  The easing has already taken place.  Another economist disagreed.  As long as there are benefits,  he argued,  they’ve got to keep trying.",Fed Cuts Rate Half-Point to 1%

And since there are 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, ThinkProgress notes, Beck is basically calling 157 million of them terrorists. The talk show host made the comment on his radio show yesterday, the Huffington Post reports, while he was taking the mainstream media to task for not covering the  revolutionaries here in America  who want  an open violent revolution.  His guess at the reason: The number of threats isn't staggering enough to concern the media, which is when he turned his talk to Muslims.  What is the number of Islamic terrorists? One percent? I think it's closer to 10% but the rest of the PC world will tell you, 'Oh no, it's minuscule.' OK, well, let's take you at your 1%. Look at the havoc 1% of Muslims causing in the rest of the world.

Reuters reports that William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old from Warwickshire, also got his shot at University Hospital in Coventry, which is just 20 miles or so from Stratford-Upon-Avon, where the more famous Shakespeare was born. The modern-day Shakespeare's inoculation has spurred what the Washington Post calls  an inevitable flurry of puns.  The Metro newspaper, for example, captioned a social media post about Shakespeare's vaccination  the taming of the flu,  while someone deemed Keenan  Patient 1A,  then asked if Shakespeare was  Patient 2B or not 2B?

Sedley Alley, April Alley's father, was executed in 2006 for the 1985 murder of Marine Lance Cpl. Suzanne Collins. In May, April Alley petitioned the court on behalf of her father’s estate to order DNA testing, the AP reports. The move came after investigators in a Missouri case contacted the Innocence Project about a possible connection between that suspect and Collins.

That's the gist of Hurricane Dorian news Wednesday after the Category 1 storm caused flooding and power outages across Caribbean islands—including Puerto Rico—and grew closer to a Category 3 while churning toward the mainland, the AP reports.  All indications are that by this Labor Day weekend, a powerful hurricane will be near or over the Florida peninsula,  said the National Hurricane Center, per USA Today. As for Puerto Rico, the wind and rain weren't too heavy, sparing the US territory a major blow after Hurricane Maria's destruction in 2017.

Harry Reid's Senate Democrats rejected the measure at the start of business today, after the government shutdown already had started going into effect.

Truett Foster McKeehan was the oldest child of TobyMac, who got his start with Christian group DC Talk before breaking out into a solo career.  Truett did pass away at home in the Nashville area sometime Tuesday night or Wednesday morning,  a family rep confirms.  Cause of death has not been determined.  Per Heavy, a 911 call stating McKeehan was in cardiac arrest was made at 11am Wednesday. TobyMac left a weeklong tour in Canada to be with his wife and four other children at their Franklin, Tenn., home after getting the news. The younger McKeehan was a rapper in his own right, releasing songs as Truett Foster, truDog, TRU, and Shiloh. He was also a member of the group HySociety, and had collaborated with his father on multiple songs as well. Last year, TobyMac released a song about his eldest child,  Scars,  which includes lyrics like  Now you won’t take my phone calls / You won’t text me back at all / I just wanna see you / I can’t stand to see you gone.  He told the Tennessean at the time that it was inspired by Truett leaving home.  He moved to LA and he's making music, and he's doing his thing.

The children's restaurant chain, which applied for bankruptcy protection in June, has asked a bankruptcy court for permission to spend $2.3 million to destroy 7 billion prize tickets before they fall into the wrong hands, CNN reports. The tickets, which players win at arcade games and exchange for prizes, could potentially be traded in for around $9 million in merchandise at its 612 locations, the company said. According to the court filing, the supply of tickets could fill  65 40-foot cargo shipping containers.   Since prize tickets are redeemable by guests at significantly higher value than the cost of prize tickets, the debtors instead need to arrange for the destruction of the remaining stock of prize tickets in the supply chain to mitigate any risk of these tickets being circulated to the general public,  the court filing said, per the New York Post.

Big difference: That jet had no passengers aboard, but the circumstances surrounding its disappearance are pretty strange nonetheless. Two mechanics—American Ben Charles Padilla and Congolese assistant John Mikel Mutantu—boarded the Boeing 727 on a Luanda airstrip to get it in shape for its next flight. Neither had a pilot's license, which is why flight controllers were stunned when the plane taxied to the runway and then took off. Was it Padilla? Mutantu? Both? Hijackers who had slipped aboard? Investigators still don't know, and no sign of the plane has turned up despite an intense international hunt. Some of the theories being tossed around in regard to Flight 370—it crashed into the ocean, it landed secretly, it got shot down by some nation's military—were similarly floated back then. But  we may never know for sure where it went,  concluded an earlier investigation by Air & Space magazine.

But a team of three astronauts—two Russian, one from NASA—arrived at 10:28pm last night after just a five-hour, 45-minute journey, CNN reports. Normally, a spacecraft headed to the ISS circles the Earth 16 times during the trip; in the latest excursion, the Soyuz spacecraft orbited the planet just four times, thanks in part to equipment and computer software improvements.  We're trying to cut that amount of time that they had to be in those close quarters,  says a NASA rep. Still, officials may ultimately decide the longer trip is better because it gives astronauts more time to get acclimated to space.

The bombings in Baghdad and a town south of the capital were the latest attacks by suspected Sunni insurgents trying to re-ignite sectarian violence and undermine the Shiite-led government. The bombings targeted an outdoor pet market in Baghdad's northern Kazimyah neighborhood and a vegetable market in the Shiite town of Shomali in Hillah province. In Baghdad, the first car bomb exploded around mid-morning at the entrance to the Kazimyah market, police said. When panicked shoppers tried to flee the area, a second parked car exploded a few yards away, according to the officers, who said at least 17 people were killed and 45 were wounded.

Per Deadline, Reynolds started working for the small screen in the late '50s, writing for the NBC Western Tales of Wells Fargo. Soon he was directing series such as Leave It to Beaver, The Munsters, The Andy Griffith Show, and My Three Sons, and he started producing in the '60s for such shows as Hogan's Heroes, F Troop, and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. But it was MASH, created with Larry Gelbart based on the 1970 movie of the same name, that really put Reynolds on the map.

"(Jan 20, 2012  12:18 PM) When Americans heard that Mitt Romney pays a 15% tax rate, most probably assumed that was less than they pay—and they're probably wrong. Romney, after all, wasn't talking about his tax bracket, but his effective tax rate, meaning what percentage of his income he actually winds up paying, USA Today points out. The average American's effective federal tax rate is just 11%, according to 2009 IRS data, and if you make less than $50,000, that falls to 5%. Yes, that's low—taxes are at a 40-year nadir, David Leonhardt of the New York Times points out. But most people think taxes are high, both because of weak wage growth and because they  sense, and not incorrectly, that others are benefiting from tax breaks unavailable to them,  he writes. The wealthy have seen their taxes fall the most, and they also benefit more from deductions. And then there's the fact that capital gains—which likely make up most of Romney's income—are only taxed at 15%, a part of the tax code that  favors assets over wages,  writes Jared Bernstein in the Christian Science Monitor.

The Republican capture of the House in '94 was made possible by retiring Democrats—some 22 of the 54 seats they picked up that year were open, while just four Democrat-held House seats will be open in  even vaguely competitive territory  next year, Kilgore writes. The Senate looks even less likely to fall to resurgent Republicans than the House, Kilgore argues, since it would require the Dems to lose 11 seats while not recapturing a single one. The GOP also won't be getting a bounce from redistricting the way it did in 1994, and President Bush's failure to win over Hispanics means just about every demographic trend is going against the party.

The Washington Post reports a bill that would make the penalty for swatting—calling in false threats to prompt an armed law enforcement response on unsuspecting victims—up to 20 years in prison and heavy fines just survived a  crucial  vote by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The next stop for HR 2031 (the Anti-Swatting Act of 2015) is a floor vote in the House. One of the bill's sponsors, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark has, herself, been a victim of swatting—a  frightening experience,  she tells Esquire, that was likely prompted by her support for anti-swatting legislation. In that case, someone called police saying there was an active shooter in her house. Though Esquire says the FBI doesn't maintain swatting stats, a press release from Clark cites an estimated 400 such incidents annually. While falsely phoning in bomb threats and terrorist attacks is currently a federal crime, making false reports of other emergency situations is not, and she wants to close that loophole. Online gamers, who often broadcast their gameplay in real time on the Internet, are often the target of swatting, and at the Post, Brian Fung observes that  the swatting trend underscores how easy it is, in the Internet age, for a harasser to dig up personal information belonging to their targets.

"(Oct 4, 2012  10:07 AM CDT) Facebook has crossed the 1 billion mark, Mark Zuckerberg announced today in an appearance on the Today show in which he nonetheless acknowledged that his 8-year-old company is  in a tough cycle now.  The milestone means that one in every seven people uses the site, notes Fast Company, but the heat is on for Facebook to find a way to better monetize its service, and it's got a new plan: Charge US users to promote certain posts. The $7 service, currently being tested, would give users pride of place on their friends' news feeds. That price could change, says a rep. Some are skeptical of the policy: Would users be willing to pay for a key aspect of Facebook?  I know it’s just a test, but it doesn’t send the right message,  says an analyst.  Charging for something so generic doesn’t make sense.  New Zealand and other countries, however, have had the pay-to-promote service for months. Zuckerberg today posted a note of thanks to users over the 1 billion milestone.","Facebook Hits 1B Users, Still Searching for the Money"

"(Dec 14, 2013  4:15 PM) A casino owner-turned-commercial developer is asking $7.85 million to sell a Las Vegas home, and he's willing to accept the online currency bitcoin for the deal. Jack Sommer says he got the idea to seek bitcoin for his 25,000-square-foot mansion from two of his sons, who've been involved in making and trading the currency.  The advantage is that we're expanding our market and adding some notoriety,  Sommer says. Sommer's sales agent says the home—which includes marble from China, Iceland and Brazil, a full basement, staff quarters with Jacuzzis, and a secret garden—may be the first in southern Nevada to be marketed formally around bitcoin. A Canadian man listed his Alberta home for the bitcoin equivalent of $405,000, and a Tesla recently sold for 91.4 bitcoin.

The Swiss central bank will offer UBS a capital injection of $6 billion in exchange for 9% of the company, and it will allow UBS to offload billions in illiquid assets into a specially created fund. Another top Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, also received a lifeline after raising $10 billion from Mideast investors. UBS has posted $44.2 billion in credit losses and writedowns since the start of the year, the most of any European investment bank.

"(Jun 9, 2015  2:54 AM CDT) After 43 years in solitary confinement, two overturned convictions, and two documentaries on his case, freedom could finally be at hand for Albert Woodfox. A federal judge has ordered the release of the 67-year-old, who was placed in solitary in 1972 after the death of a guard in a riot at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which is better known as Angola, the Guardian reports. In his ruling, US District Judge James Brady took the unusual step of banning the state from trying Woodfox for the guard's murder for a third time, citing his age, health, the  prejudice done onto  him by more than 40 years in solitary confinement, and  the very fact that Mr. Woodfox has already been tried twice,  the AP reports. Woodfox, who was in prison for armed robbery at the time of the guard's death, has always maintained his innocence and says he and the two other members of the  Angola Three  were singled out because of their Black Panther activism, reports the Guardian. A supporter tells the AP that the order for unconditional release is a  unicorn  because it is so rare—although the state seems determined to keep Woodfox behind bars. Officials say Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is seeking an emergency stay  to make sure this murderer stays in prison and remains fully accountable for his actions,  the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports.

"(May 4, 2017  7:21 AM CDT) Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Walmart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee cops announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at four people in a Nissan sedan and chased them for seven miles. None of the men in the car was wanted on outstanding charges, the AP reports. In fact, the bounty hunters were looking for someone else, with no indication any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll says. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, says his nephew and and his three companions thought they were being attacked by gang members and tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins says, started shooting in the Walmart parking lot and kept firing during the chase. Clarksville cops wouldn't discuss these details. The Montgomery County grand jury charged the seven men from Clarksville—William Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger West, 31; Prentice Williams, 34; and Joshua Young, 27—with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, and a slew of other charges, police say. Some of the men charged were bonding agents, others were strictly bounty hunters, per Knoll.

I have fought against the powerful, powerful people, and powerful corporations. I will never stop fighting that good fight,  Avenatti told reporters outside the court.  I am highly confident that when all of the evidence is laid bare ... I will be fully exonerated and justice will be done.  Prosecutors say Avenatti and another lawyer tried to extort millions from Nike by threatening to reveal damaging allegations. The lawyers allegedly told Nike that the matter could be settled if the company paid them $1.5 million and hired them for another $15 million to $25 million to conduct an  internal investigation —or simply paid them $22.5 million to  resolve any claims,  the Washington Post reports. Sources tell the Post that the other attorney is celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos.

"(Nov 21, 2014  9:22 AM) Ten reports of full or partial fingertip amputations and one finger laceration have prompted the voluntary recall of 5 million strollers manufactured by Graco Children's Products, CNN reports. The Graco- and Century-branded models have folding hinges that  can pinch a child’s finger, posing a laceration or amputation hazard,  reports the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which also warns those watching children to show  extreme care when unfolding the stroller to be certain that the hinges are firmly locked before placing a child in the stroller.  A free repair kit with hinge covers will be offered for affected models, which were sold through Target, Toys R Us, Walmart, Amazon, and other retail and online sites, according to Graco. Recalled models include Aspen, Breeze, Capri, Cirrus, Glider, Kite, LiteRider, Sierra, Solara, Sterling, and TravelMate model strollers and travel systems, with a manufacture date of Aug. 1, 2000, to Sept. 25, 2014. Even such a big recall might not take babies out of harm's way, though. An investigation set to air on ABC's 20/20 tonight shows that most recalled products are never brought in or fixed—at best, the number hovers around 20%, at worst 5%, ABC News reports. Instead, the products stay in use or—worse—are listed for resale, which is illegal, according to the CPSC.

Keeping it real  was Almaty's slogan, with a promo video promising  Real snow, real winter ambiance, real winter games.

"(Nov 5, 2017  6:40 PM) Detroit is awash with abandoned homes, which left the Rev. Faith Fowler a bit on the defensive about why she built seven brand new ones. But there's something special about hers: They're tiny, and the first part of an envisioned tiny home village where low-income Detroiters can not only find safe and affordable housing, but work to achieve the otherwise impossible-seeming dream of homeownership. Fowler is the executive director of Cass Community Social Services, whose Tiny Homes Project has thus far erected those well-equipped and well-built homes (see a video tour here) on seven of the 25 vacant lots that CNBC reports CCSS bought from the city for $15,000. The houses cost about $50,000 each to build. Those now living in them (122 applied for the first seven homes; those chosen have an average annual income of just under $12,000, reports the Christian Science Monitor) pay $1 per square foot—meaning somewhere between $250 and $400—plus cover electricity. They also participate in a homeowners association and take home maintenance and financial literacy classes. But what's so especially unique about the program is that after paying the rent for seven years, they will own the home outright. As for the genesis of the idea, the death of Fowler's mother made her consider the subject of inheritance and, as the Monitor writes,  how the poor often miss out on what can be an important economic safeguard.

USA Today reports on a new warning from the CDC, which notes that the  fast-multiplying  Asian longhorned tick first made an appearance in August 2017 on a New Jersey sheep (one had previously been found there, in 2013 on a dog), and has since spread to at least eight other states—New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Arkansas. The ticks have dug in not just on livestock, but also on pets, animals in the wild, and humans, and they've been spotted as well in environmental samples.  We are concerned that this tick, which can cause massive infestations ... is spreading in the United States,  a CDC director notes. What makes the tick particularly concerning is that a female can shoot out up to 2,000 eggs at a time without mating help from a male—meaning one person or animal can end up as an unfortunate host to thousands of ticks. An unfed Asian longhorned tick can survive for up to a year. Health officials aren't sure whether the Asian longhorned tick can spread Lyme disease, but what it can spread is bad enough. Forbes notes those sicknesses have included a trio of  nasty  viruses, including the SFTS and Heartland viruses, as well as other disease-carrying microbes, though there've been no reports yet of any of those illnesses being transmitted in the US by the tick. Livestock in particular has been affected by this critter in Australia and New Zealand, where it's been capable of reducing dairy production by 25%.

Per the Guardian, the nearly $10 million left to 17 area schools last month by Eva Gordon came as a surprise not only to the schools, but also to many of Gordon's friends and family members.  Believe me, nobody around her knew what she had,  godson John Jacobs tells the Seattle Times, adding that Gordon was able to amass her fortune by working hard, being frugal, and making smart investments.  She was a very intelligent woman ... and had the wherewithal to buy stocks and hold on to them that a lot of people at that age didn't really do too much,  Jacobs tells the Guardian, which notes Gordon scooped up stock in such Pacific Northwest giants as Starbucks, Microsoft, and Nordstrom. MyEdmondsNews.com reports that Gordon, who grew up on an orchard in Oregon, was at the top of her high school class, but her family didn't have the money to send her to college.

Instead, she moved to Seattle, became a trading assistant for an investment firm, and married stockbroker Ed Gordon, socking away parts of her small paychecks and slowly building up her wealth. The lack of her own formal higher education and dedication to helping others—she regularly volunteered and donated to educational and children's programs—likely drove her decision for this donation, Jacobs says, adding she would have been a  little annoyed  to see all the headlines about it, per the Times.

It's at this point that Fedden's mom, Kathi Fedden, thinks police should have arrested her 29-year-old son for DWI, according to a $30 million wrongful-death lawsuit she filed Monday against the police, Newsday reports. But instead, cops dropped a  severely intoxicated  Peter off at home, where he got right into his mother's car sitting in the driveway and crashed it minutes later into the side of an industrial park building. He died from injuries sustained in the second crash. Kathi Fedden says the police let Peter off the hook the first time because of his rapport with them at the deli he owned in Commack.  Peter served many Suffolk County police officers at his deli, and it was known throughout the local officers that Peter charged only $1 for officers to eat at the deli no matter what they ordered,  the suit says. Because of this relationship, Kathi Fedden claims, the police  conspired to avoid charging Peter with any crimes  and  carelessly disregarded Peter's safety ... and actually created the events leading to Peter's wrongful death.  Also named in the suit: Ruby Tuesday, which reportedly served Peter two drinks—10 ounces of Jack Daniel's whiskey over soda and ice—the night he died, Newsday notes. While sympathetic to the Fedden family, the owner of the building Peter crashed into tells NBC New York,  He put the community in harm's way.

And with the mountain claiming one in 10 climbers who try to summit, Kuriki decided not to push his luck. This time it was the conditions that prompted him to turn back after spending a month acclimatizing, reports CNN.  I realized if I kept going, I wouldn't be able to come back alive,  Kuriki wrote on Facebook. Kuriki was at the final stretch, having rested at the last camp on the route that Everest's first climbers, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, took in 1953, but  it took too much time to move in deep deep snow,  he wrote. Kuriki was not only climbing without oxygen, but also without partners—he prefers to climb solo—and at a difficult, more volatile time of year. Climbers typically make their attempts in May, but Nepal closed the mountain for the spring climbing season after the April earthquake killed 19 people at base camp. Kuriki was the first to make an attempt since. (The earthquake actually moved Everest's peak.)",Climber Who Lost 9 Fingers Abandons Everest
"(Oct 28, 2019  1:05 PM CDT) The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth, following a record-breaking two-year mission. The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida Sunday, per the AP. The Air Force is mum about what the unmanned plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable test vehicle, which looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet. Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives, without specifying them. Experiments from the Air Force Research Laboratory were aboard. This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year with another launch from Cape Canaveral.

The label on the reel includes the date and  Pachyderm Studios,  where it was recorded, reports Alternative Nation, which notes that the set features multiple demo versions of the songs  Dumb  and  Marigold.  But the  real jewels,  it adds, are two never-before-heard instrumental tracks—one featuring Dave Grohl on all instruments, including a frantic drum solo, and the dissonant  Lullaby,  which may have featured Cobain on drums and includes a cosmic keyboard effect. The Daily Dot points out that both tracks are incomplete and that Grohl's drum solo sounds a bit like a precursor to the Foo Fighters.

"(Aug 17, 2015  7:47 AM CDT) A Canadian company best known for building tiny objects suitable for outer space has just earned a US patent on something distinctly grander: a 12-mile-high inflatable space elevator held up not by cables but by pressurized segments, reports fastcoexist.com. That's more than 20 times taller than the world’s current tallest building, the nearly 3,000-foot-tall Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. So why a space elevator? Because rockets (and, presumably, the space tourists inside them) require less force to launch when starting that much closer to the destination.  Landing at 12 miles above sea level will make space flight more like taking a passenger jet,  says Thoth Technology CEO Caroline Roberts in a press release. The inventor says astronauts would reach the top via electrical elevator, from where rockets can launch in a single stage to orbit as well as return to refuel. If this seems far-fetched, it's actually less ambitious than Obayashi Corporation's hope to build a space elevator a quarter of the way to the moon by 2050, reports CNET. Even so, Thoth's ambition still requires building just beyond what is known as the  Armstrong Limit,  or  the point at which atmospheric pressure is so low that your bodily fluids would boil off without a protective suit,  reports Global Construction Review. The idea is gaining so much traction that Seattle is actually hosting a Space Elevator Conference later this month.

"(Feb 22, 2016  11:17 AM) A certain type of laminate flooring made by Lumber Liquidators may up the risk of cancer, and the company's stocks are taking a beating, CNNMoney reports. Shares fell by up to 24% Monday morning, per Bloomberg and Reuters, after the CDC issued a revised report that found health effects from the formaldehyde in unnamed floor samples from China include increased risk of respiratory issues such as asthma or eye, nose, and throat irritation, as well as an estimated risk of six to 30 cases of cancer per every 100,000 people. The risk for both these issues was upped from an earlier version of the report that used the wrong measurement for ceiling height, which resulted in the formaldehyde concentration in the air coming in at about a third less than it should've been (that earlier report put the risk at two to nine cases per 100,000).  We sent the report to scientists at several universities and discovered the government forgot to convert feet to meters in some calculations,  Anderson Cooper said during Sunday night's broadcast of 60 Minutes, per Reuters. Lumber Liquidators, which stopped selling the lumber soon after last year's 60 Minutes report, says in a statement the CDC's  revised calculation overestimates any potential health risks from these products, and we are encouraged that [the] CDC is seeking a broader review of their conclusions.  This isn't the only hit to its reputation: The company recently agreed to settle for $13 million, plus a five-year probationary period, for bringing in wood from forests that serve as home for endangered species, per USA Today.

"(Jun 26, 2015  8:24 AM CDT) The State Department is still poring over 55,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails, but officials made an important announcement yesterday: She didn't turn over at least 15 work-related emails as requested, the New York Times reports. How the discovery was made: The House committee looking into the Benghazi debacle subpoenaed correspondence from longtime Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and the State Department cross-referenced the emails he handed over and the ones Clinton did. It found nine emails Blumenthal had were completely missing from her files, as well as parts of six others. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chair of the Benghazi committee, calls the findings  significant  and  troubling  and says that Blumenthal was passing along  unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat  from a source who reportedly had a financial interest in Libya, reports Fox News. But Clinton aides say she handed over all Blumenthal emails, plus a dozen more that he didn't turn in—and that there's no proof the 15 messages in question were actually sent in the form of an email, as Blumenthal compiled the records he handed over into a Microsoft Word document, the AP reports. Officials say that while some are Libya-related, the Blumenthal messages to Clinton don't directly deal with the 2012 Benghazi attacks: Instead, they discuss topics such as media reports about the death of one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons and the inner workings of Libyan rebels. Gowdy isn’t convinced the messages are moot, however.  This has implications far beyond Libya, Benghazi, and our committee's work,  he said in a statement, per CNN.  This conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself, which was then vetted by her own lawyers, has resulted in an incomplete public record.",State Dept. Says Hillary Didn't Turn Over 15 Emails

"(Jul 30, 2019  8:03 AM CDT) Ethiopia claims it has smashed a world record in the name of climate change—and the tree planting isn't even done. More than 353 million tree seedlings were planted across the country in just 12 hours as part of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Green Legacy reforestation campaign, per CNN. The campaign hopes to see 4 billion indigenous trees planted between May and October. Citizens had been encouraged to plant 200 million trees on Monday, but Ahmed tweeted that 150 million had been planted after just six hours. At the end of 12 hours, the country's minster for innovation and technology, Getahun Mekuria, announced 353,633,660 seedlings had gone into the ground—more than five times as many trees as were planted in India over 12 hours in 2017, per CNN. Some schools and government offices closed to allow students and civil servants to take part, per Al Jazeera, which notes 2.6 billion trees have now been planted across Ethiopia. The Guardian reports each citizen is asked to plant at least 40 seedlings. The goal is to transform Ethiopia's landscape, which is seeing degradation, soil erosion, deforestation, and droughts and flooding tied to agriculture. About 80% of Ethiopia's population relies on agriculture to make a living, with the result that just 4% of land is now forested, compared to 30% at the end of the 19th century, according to Farm Africa.

The FBI says the 20-year-old encouraged an informant to plant a pressure-cooker bomb at a 9/11 memorial event in Kansas City, Mo., this weekend, instructing them to coat nails in rat poison to cause maximum damage, USA Today reports. According to court documents, Goldberg, who lives with his parents, claimed to have a  vast network of mujahideen around the world  and to have inspired the May attack on a Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, in which two suspects were shot dead.

USA Today reports GOP lawmakers on Tuesday announced two new investigations involving Clinton. The House Intelligence and House Oversight committees will be investigating the Obama administration's approval of the purchase by a Russian state-owned energy company of a Canadian company whose mines control 20% of the US' uranium supply. Republicans say they want to know if the State Department under Clinton approved the deal because of donations made to the Clinton Foundation.

"(Oct 23, 2018  7:33 AM CDT) While nobody wants the nation's airmen to have to drink cold coffee, Air Force officials have admitted that spending $1,280 for a metal mug that breaks easily is  irresponsible,  USA Today reports. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley that the service has spent $326,785 since 2016 on the special mugs, which can reheat drinks on air refueling tankers in flight. Service members tell Fox that because of their design, the handle breaks easily when the cups are dropped—and when that happens, a new mug has to be purchased at great expense because replacement parts are not available. Decreased production has caused the price of replacement cups to almost double over the last few years. After Grassley wrote to the Air Force, questioning what he called  yet another report of wasteful spending in the Department of Defense,  Wilson told him that a solution was in the works. She said the new Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office can supply 3D printed handles for just 50 cents each.  It is simply irresponsible to spend thousands of dollars on manufactured parts when we have the technology available to produce them ourselves,  she told the Republican. Grassley said in a statement Friday that while he was glad to hear about the innovations, he's still not sure why the Air Force can't find a cheaper alternative to a $1,280 cup in the first place.

"(Jan 11, 2019  7:50 AM) One of two children considered missing after their family's SUV sped off a Northern California cliff in March has been confirmed dead. DNA tests on a partial foot recovered near the crash site in Westport in May confirmed it to be that of 16-year-old Hannah Hart, the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Married parents Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, and three of six adopted children—Markis, 19, Abigail, 14, and Jeremiah, 14—were confirmed dead as the vehicle was discovered on March 26, 2018. Remains of a fourth child, 12-year-old Ciera, were found in April, but Hannah, 16, and Devonte, 15, remained missing. The test on the partial foot, found inside a shoe attached to a pair of jeans, was made possible as the biological mother of Markis, Abigail, and Hannah emerged in October to provide a DNA sample, reports KGW. As the sheriff's department has  not received any indication of Devonte being located elsewhere … the most likely scenario is that he too perished in this incident but the case remains open and active,  per a release. Authorities have described the crash at the cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway as intentional. Jennifer's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit when investigators say she accelerated off the cliff without braking. Sarah and some of the children were sedated, per CNN. The family had set out from Woodland, Wash., days earlier as child-welfare officials looked for them.

Thanks to news articles about the impending birth of the quadruplets, donations of money and baby necessities poured in for Elizabeth Whittle and Anthony Perez. Despite the donations and the fact that she said the babies were a gift from God,  my birth mom could not handle four babies at once,  Hannah Nelson, born Megan Perez, says now. At just four months old, Hannah and her three brothers were hospitalized with dozens of broken bones, skull fractures, and other injuries; eventually, Elizabeth Whittle was sent to prison for child abuse and her husband was also jailed for failing to protect his babies.

"(Jan 27, 2015  10:15 PM) Investigators are now certain that 43 college students missing since September were killed and incinerated after they were seized by police in southern Guerrero state, the Mexican attorney general says. It was the first time Jesus Murillo Karam has said all the students are definitely dead. Mexican authorities have DNA identification for only one student and a laboratory in Austria has declared that it appears impossible to identify the others. The attorney general cited confessions and forensic evidence from an area near a garbage dump where the Sept. 26 crime occurred that showed the fuel and temperature of the fire were sufficient to turn 43 bodies into ashes.  The evidence allows us to determine that the students were kidnapped, killed, burned, and thrown into the river,  Murillo Karam said in a press conference that included a video reconstruction of the mass slaying. He added that  there is not a single shred of evidence that the army intervened  as relatives of the victims have claimed. The attorney general has come under attack from many quarters, including the students' relatives and fire experts, who say the government's version of what happened is implausible. Family members are still searching in hopes of finding the students alive. So far 99 people have been detained in connection with the crime, including the former mayor of Iguala and his wife, whose brothers were leading members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang.",Mexico Declares 43 Missing Students Dead
"(Apr 1, 2010  9:29 AM CDT) A feud and a quest for revenge among neighborhood crews may be behind the Washington, DC, drive-by that left four dead Tuesday—as well as other shootings. A 14-year-old boy accused of driving the minivan, and two adult men have been charged with first-degree murder. One of the adult suspects, Orlando Carter, also has been charged with second-degree murder in the March 22 shooting of Jordan Howe. It gets more intricately connected from there. Carter's brother, Sanquan, was charged March 23 in Howe's murder, whose funeral the victims attended Tuesday morning. Carter himself was shot in the head and shoulder hours after his brother's arrest, said court documents, which note that Howe was allegedly killed over a missing gold-colored bracelet that apparently belonged to Sanquan.

"(Mar 2, 2014  6:53 AM) Last summer, four prison inmates organized a hunger strike from their solitary-confinement cells and inspired 30,000 prisoners to join them—a stunning development that says a lot about US prisons, writes Benjamin Wallace-Wells in New York. The four guys—allegedly leaders of white, black, and Latino gangs—were eventually force-fed at Pelican Bay State Prison in California but kept on striking. After about two months, down to 65 fellow strikers, they called it quits when state lawmakers offered to hold hearings about conditions in the prison's solitary cells.  That is a victory,  said one of the leaders. Indeed, the hearings suggest that reform is in the air, and four other states have stopped allowing prison isolation. But how did an incarceration method that some liken to torture become so widespread? Wallace-Wells looks back to the 1980s and '90s, when crime escalated and California prison gangs rose to prominence along racial lines: Black Guerrilla Family for blacks, Aryan Brotherhood for whites, and Nuestra Familia and the Mexican Mafia for latinos. Authorities reacted by approving the Secure Housing Unit at Pelican Bay, where 1,100 prisoners are held in nearly as many cells to isolate gang members from one another. But while street crime plummeted, the prisoners still found ways to communicate—like shouting through toilet drains and leaving messages in library books—and reports emerged of prisoners experiencing psychosis in solitary. Ergo the hunger strike, which  did not necessarily prove that their conditions amounted to torture,  writes Wallace-Wells.  But it did suggest something else: that perhaps human isolation of the kind that Pelican Bay was built to achieve was impossible.

"(Sep 7, 2017  7:39 AM CDT) Jasmine Block is  an unbelievable young woman.  That's what a police chief has to say after the 15-year-old escaped from captors who allegedly assaulted her over the course of a month. Block reportedly left her home in Alexandria, Minn., on Aug. 8 with a family acquaintance who said he needed her help, reports the Echo Press. When Jasmine arrived at Thomas Barker's home in Carlos, however, she encountered a  nightmare,  says Alexandria Police Chief Rick Wyffels. Barker, 32—soon joined by his roommate and later a friend—restrained the teen with zip ties. At no point over the next 28 days was Jasmine left alone as she was physically and sexually assaulted and moved to a cornfield and then a home on a lake in Grant County, Wyffels says. But on the 29th day, Jasmine saw an opportunity to escape. When her captors left to get lunch on Tuesday, Jasmine escaped and  bravely ran door to door  without finding help, Wyffels says. Finally, she swam across the 150-acre lake to a property and encountered its owner, who'd just returned from work because he'd forgotten something.  It was like somebody shined a big beam of light on me,  the man tells WCCO.  I was in the right place at the right time.  Just as police arrived, Jasmine—later treated for minor injuries, per NBC News—spotted a car belonging to one of her captors whom police quickly apprehended, the property owner adds. All three alleged captors are now in custody. Barker; Joshua Holby, 31; and Steven Powers, 20, are each held on probable cause for false imprisonment, kidnapping, and assault. Wyffels says authorities are still trying to determine a motive.","Cops: Girl Was Held 29 Days, Then Captors Went to Lunch"

"(Oct 14, 2019  9:15 AM CDT) The distance between Whitestown, Ind., and Neenah, Wis., is just over 350 miles—not usually a distance one would want to travel mostly on foot. That apparently didn't faze Tommy Lee Jenkins, however, as he allegedly thought a 14-year-old girl was waiting for him for possible sex. What was really waiting for the 32-year-old on Oct. 10 in Wisconsin's Winnebago County: an arrest, as the girl was actually an undercover cop, the Oshkosh Northwestern reports. The Washington Post lays out the online relationship Jenkins and  Kaylee Marie  allegedly started on Oct. 1, including instant messages in which the supposed teen revealed she was 14 and liked to drink, and which soon became explicit, per a police affidavit. On Oct. 6, the affidavit notes,  Kaylee  agreed to have Jenkins come to Wisconsin to get her—and he messaged her he'd started walking. It's not clear how much Jenkins actually walked, but he sent  Kaylee  pics as he made his journey, authorities say; they add he also sent a message saying he wanted to have 500 kids with her. Local cops and the FBI arrested him when he got to Winnebago County. Jenkins had previously pleaded no contest to child abuse and was sentenced to four years of probation after two young boys told police in 2011 that Jenkins had molested them.  Our nation faces an epidemic of child sexual abuse, with the internet making it too easy for predators to communicate with children across the country,  US Attorney Matthew Krueger says in a statement. Jenkins faces charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce, or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, which could bring at least 10 years and up to life in prison if convicted.

One boy fled, but the man blindfolded and abducted the other, who was 14, and sexually assaulted him. Fifteen years later, police finally got a break in the case. Late last year, 54-year-old Mirek Voyt was convicted of stealing money from his place of employment, a grocery store chain. Since that's a felony, his DNA was taken and entered into a database—and authorities found that it matched DNA evidence from the years-ago attack. Voyt was arrested Tuesday and charged with the assault, the Los Angeles Times reports. He pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of kidnapping to commit rape and forcible oral copulation. Police believe Voyt took the victim to his home to assault him; he ultimately released the boy, KTLA reports. Authorities now fear Voyt may have committed other attacks in the intervening years, and are asking anyone with information to get in touch with police. He's moved around the Los Angeles area during that time, NBC LA reports, and worked in a management position at a  large  grocery store chain police are not naming specifically.

"(May 16, 2017  1:29 PM CDT) A Mississippi man received a 49-year prison sentence Monday for the first-ever conviction on federal hate crime charges arising from the killing of a transgender woman, the AP reports. In a case watched by the LGBT community nationwide, US District Judge Louis Guirola Jr. sentenced Joshua Vallum, 29, in the 2015 killing of 17-year-old Mercedes Williamson. It was the first case prosecuted under the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act involving a victim targeted because of gender identity. Prosecutors said Vallum shocked Williamson with a stun gun, stabbed her, and beat her to death to keep fellow Latin Kings gang members from discovering the two were having sex. Gang rules barred homosexual activity and declared it punishable by death. The couple had broken up in 2014 but a friend had recently discovered Williamson was transgender, per CNN. Guirola could have sentenced Vallum to life in prison, but heeded a lesser sentence suggested in a plea agreement between defense attorneys and prosecutors, citing Vallum's neglected childhood and other issues. Both the judge and defense lawyers said Vallum's history of abuse as a child had to be considered. Vallum pleaded guilty to the federal charges in December. He previously pleaded guilty to a state murder charge that led to a separate sentence of life without parole. On Monday, Vallum begged forgiveness from Williamson's family and friends, though none of them were present—only a few reporters, the judge, and Vallum's father and stepmother.  Every day, I live with the guilt and regret of my actions,  Vallum said.

"(Sep 9, 2014  5:23 AM CDT) Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was likely struck by multiple  high-energy objects from outside the aircraft,  causing it to break up over eastern Ukraine, a preliminary report into the disaster concluded today. The report by the Dutch Safety Board stopped short of saying the Boeing 777 was shot down by a missile, but its findings appear to point to that conclusion. It also didn't say who might have been responsible. The Boeing 777 suddenly plunged out of the sky July 17 over pro-Russia rebel-held territory in Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board.  The damage observed in the forward section of the aircraft appears to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects,  the report states. Because of the ongoing conflict between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces, investigators from the board have not visited the fields where the wreckage of Flight 17 plunged to the ground. That likely contributed to the board's cautious assessment of what happened.  Detailed examination of the structural damage is ongoing,  the report says.  Forensic examination will be performed if the wreckage can be removed.  Investigators so far have studied photos of the crash site, radar data, and information gleaned from the downed jet's black boxes.

India is home to 13.9 million slaves, by far the largest number; relative to population, however, Mauritania has the highest rate, with 4% of the population enslaved (though other groups have placed the figure as high as 20%).

"(Nov 21, 2011  2:33 AM) A group of California billionaires is joining political insiders to put a $10 billion tax hike measure on the state ballot. Members of the Think Long Committee include billionaire Google chairman Eric Schmidt and philanthropist Eli Broad, as well as former governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Condoleezza Rice. The group's plan is to boost tax revenue for education and to pay down the state's debt by relying on an  ideological hybrid  of ideas from both the right and the left, spokesman Nathan Gardels tells the San Francisco Chronicle. The proposal would lower California's personal income tax and sales tax rates, but impose a 5% tax on currently untaxed services such as legal work and accounting. Under the proposal, couples earning up to $45,000 would pay no state income tax; those earning up to $95,000 would pay 2%; and those earning more would pay 7.5%, with a 1% surcharge for Californians earning more than $1 million. The corporate tax rate would be cut from 8.84% to 7%. Committee founder Nicolas Berggruen has said he'll commit $20 million of his own funds to pass the measure, reports the Los Angeles Times.

"(Jul 14, 2020  4:54 AM CDT) The Supreme Court cleared the way for federal executions to resume early Tuesday, just hours before a man convicted of killing a family of three was scheduled to die. The 5-4 opinion, issued around 2am, determined inmates had  not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention,  per the Washington Post. On Monday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia had blocked the Justice Department from carrying out the first federal executions since 2003, arguing legal challenges should be heard in court. Chutkan had also blocked executions in December, though the court of appeals later gave the green light. Early Tuesday, Supreme Court justices wrote that last-minute stays  should be the extreme exception, not the norm.

It's unclear if the execution was carried out as planned around 4am, per Reuters. Lee was convicted in 1999 of murdering an 8-year-old girl and her parents in Arkansas. But even the lead prosecutor and federal judge in the case disagreed with the execution. They described Lee as a follower of white supremacist Chevie Kehoe, who received a life sentence for the same crime. Relatives of one of the victims had sought to delay Lee's execution until it was safe for them to travel to the prison. They cited personal health issues amid the pandemic. But the Justice Department said it was not required to consider  the availability and travel preferences  of those wishing to attend. Wesley Purkey, convicted of raping and killing a teenager in Missouri in 2003, and Dustin Lee Honken, convicted of killing five people in Iowa in 2004, are scheduled to be executed on Wednesday and Friday, respectively.",First Federal Execution Since 2003 to Proceed

"(Nov 9, 2009  3:31 AM) Federal investigators are probing a connection between Fort Hood rampage suspect Nidal Malik Hasan and the Muslim imam who was spiritual adviser to two 9/11 terrorists. Hasan attended the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in northern Virginia in 2001 when it was led by Anwar al-Aulaqi. The US-born imam, who now lives in Yemen, is a major supporter of Al Qaeda. Hasan  connections to Aulaqi would be problematic on many levels,  said a counter-terrorism official, who called the imam  a radicalizer of the first order.  It's not yet clear how well Hasan may have known Aulaqi. Investigators say they are still operating on the theory that Hasan acted alone when he shot dead 13 at Fort Hood.

That's the idea behind Mitch Lowe's startup company MoviePass, which Tuesday dropped that monthly subscription fee from up to $21 (for just two movies a month) to $9.95 for dozens—less than the cost of a single movie ticket in most cities, Bloomberg reports. That subscription enables moviegoers to view one showing per day in any US theater that takes debit cards (not counting 3D and Imax films), which Lowe thinks should boost lagging ticket sales. In return, MoviePass will pay the theater the full price of each ticket. To compensate for the money it may lose, MoviePass is selling a majority stake to data firm Helios and Matheson Analytics, with an IPO set for next year. But while moviegoers are getting ready to pour butter on their popcorn, Variety reports that AMC is threatening to sue MoviePass for its cheaper plan, declaring in a statement that the subscription option is  shaky and unsustainable,  an uneducated attempt to  turn lead into gold,  and  not in the best interest of moviegoers, movie theaters, and movie studios.  Although MoviePass says its customers increase attendance more than 110% and fork over more money for concessions, major exhibitors like AMC prefer to invest in their own customer rewards program instead of hooking up with outside parties.

And why not? It has few side effects, cures 90% of patients, and, oh yeah, costs $1,000 a day. That price tag is causing turmoil throughout the health care system, CBS reports.

Several Democratic Congressmen recently sent a letter demanding that Sovaldi's maker, Gilead, explain the price tag—especially given that it costs 99% less in hepatitis-ridden Egypt; Congress has no power to alter the price, however. Gilead says its prices ($84,000 for a full course of treatment in the US) key off a country's per-capita income, and argues that it's still a good deal long-term, because it cures patients in 12 weeks.

Per NPR, Bob Ferguson announced that Motel 6 will pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit filed by his state after the hotel chain infringed on the privacy of tens of thousands of guests by sharing information on those guests with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The attorney general's statement notes that over that two-year-plus time period, workers at seven Motel 6 locations gave up to ICE personal details on about 80,000 guests, without those visitors' consent. In addition to guest names, info offered to the agency included everything from driver's license and passport numbers to DOBs, license plate numbers, and what rooms guests were staying in. That release of info spurred ICE to investigate guests with Latino-sounding names, which led, in some cases, to loss of jobs and homes, and even to deportations, per the AG statement. One anecdote mentioned a Seattle dad who holed up in a Motel 6 room near SeaTac to wrap Christmas gifts for his kids. ICE agents detained him, then deported him; his wife had to go to the hotel room to pick up the Christmas gifts.  Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,  Ferguson says. In addition to the $12 million payout—more than $10 million of which will go toward restitution for affected Motel 6 guests—Motel 6 also has signed a contract that assures no more guest info will be handed over without a warrant or via other lawful means, and the chain will train workers on what to do if they're asked to give up such information.",He Went to Motel 6 to Wrap His Kids' Gifts.

Stephen Brown, 23, and girlfriend, Hailey Dandurand, 20, were charged on Saturday with offenses including second-degree murder, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Boinville's body was found by visitors from Australia.  They tied up my daughter and they beat my wife to death with a baseball bat,  Boinville's husband, Kevin Emery told reporters Thursday.  They won't even let me in the house because it's so bad.  Hours after Emery issued a call for assistance on social media that included a description of Boinville's stolen truck, Brown and Dandurand were arrested near a Walmart where the vehicle was found, Hawaii News Now reports. A crowd of more than 60 people shouted angrily at the pair as they were taken away. Sources tell KHON2 that Dandurand had Boinville's credit card on her and both Dandurand and Brown had dried blood on their hands.",2 Charged in Horrific Murder of Hawaii Teacher
"(Nov 8, 2008  6:35 AM) Hotel rooms will be as scarce as McCain-Palin T-shirts in Washington on Inauguration Day, the Wall Street Journal reports, as a record-breaking tide of Obama supporters—especially black Americans—makes a pilgrimage to witness the historic moment. More than 1.5 million people are expected to flood the city for the Jan. 20 event. Hotel rooms, even at rates above $1,000 a night, are booking three times faster than for the last inauguration. Many residents are offering rooms to out-of-towners for the occasion, and many prospective visitors plan to make the trek with our without advance accommodations.

Paw Eh, 31, allegedly called her 4-year-old son to the kitchen and tried to force him to eat ant poison on a spoon; when he refused, she allegedly slapped him and forced the spoon into his mouth. This according to the boy's 12-year-old sister, who watched the whole thing; the girl says her mother also tried, unsuccessfully, to poison her other two children (the 12-year-old and a 7-year-old boy) before the two older kids ran to their grandma's apartment in the same Dallas complex and police were called. The 4-year-old was taken to a nearby hospital, where his condition was upgraded from critical to stable condition Sunday, the Dallas News reports. The other two children were released to family members Saturday and later taken into the custody of Child Protective Services, and Eh was arrested and charged with attempted capital murder, CBS DFW reports.  My mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,  the 7-year-old reportedly told police. A friend of Eh's reportedly told WFAA that Eh, who is from Burma and has neither a criminal record nor a history with CPS in Dallas County, struggled with insomnia and suicidal thoughts. A neighbor says she had medical problems and sometimes fell unconscious and woke up with no memory of what had happened.","Cops: Mom Forced Son, 4, to Eat Ant Poison"
"(Nov 10, 2016  11:14 AM) Three fisherman in Oman have found 176 pounds of precious ambergris—a substance that is essentially whale vomit but highly prized by the perfume industry. Seeker reports that the ambergris could be worth as much as $2.8 million.  I’ll wait to see how this sale will go and later I’ll think of changing my career,  one of the lucky trio tells the Times of Oman. The substance is worth so much because it is a key ingredient in high-end perfumes, helping scents linger longer on the human skin. The fishermen found it floating on the water while fishing near Qurayat.  We used a rope to collect it and carry it inside the boat,  says the fisherman. They have already received offers from traders in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and an auction is expected this week. Ambergris is produced in the digestive tracts of sperm whales and released as feces or vomit into the ocean, where it slowly hardens and floats. Most often it is found on shore, and the Conversation has a primer on how to identify the stuff.

"(Jun 23, 2014  2:57 AM CDT) A South Korean soldier who fled after allegedly killing five colleagues at a remote border outpost was captured today following an unsuccessful suicide attempt, the country's defense ministry says. The 22-year-old sergeant surnamed Yim shot himself on the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself and was taken to a nearby hospital, a ministry official says. There had been a massive manhunt for Yim since authorities said he killed five and wounded seven Saturday night before fleeing his frontline unit with his standard issue K2 assault rifle. He also fired on the troops chasing him yesterday, injuring a platoon leader. Earlier today, officials said a South Korean soldier was wounded by suspected friendly fire. At one point, troops surrounded him so closely in the forest that they could toss him a mobile phone to talk to his father as well as bread and bottled water. It wasn't clear what triggered the rampage, and there was no indication that North Korea was involved.

Prosecutors obtained the indictment late yesterday and had it put under seal until it is made public, perhaps as early as Monday. All who discussed the case did so on condition of anonymity because the matters remain sealed. The exact charges in the indictment were unclear, but the Justice Department has been considering manslaughter and assault charges against the guards for weeks.

"(Apr 13, 2015  11:09 AM CDT) Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine out of 10 adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released today. As recently as 2013, slightly more than eight out of 10 had coverage. Whether the new number from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index turns out to be a high-water mark for President Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all US residents covered, remains to be seen. The law's future is still up in the air and will hinge on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The Gallup-Healthways survey found that the share of adults who lack insurance dropped to 11.9% for the first three months of this year, the lowest level since that survey began its tracking in 2008. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got underway, according to Gallup.  The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,  says the research director for the poll.  The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.  On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since fall 2013, when the first open enrollment was about to begin, according to Gallup.",Almost 90% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance

"(Oct 22, 2013  10:26 AM CDT) Uruguay's drug czar has announced how the country will stamp out drug trafficking: by getting into the business of selling pot—legally and dirt cheap. And as long as the plan can get through the Senate (which it's expected to, with President Jose Mujica's help), marijuana sales would begin in the second half of next year. The price would be roughly $1 per gram, drug chief Julio Calzada told a local paper on Sunday. That's a lot cheaper than what medical marijuana users pay in Washington state right now, the AP points out: about $8 to $14 a gram. For Americans who lack an understanding of what a gram is, that works out to about $3.50 for an eighth, or $28 for an ounce, or $454 for a pound. Calzada helpfully explains it in terms of blunts: A gram is enough  for one marijuana cigarette or two or three slimmer cigarettes.  Only locals would be able to buy it, and they could get their hands on a max of 40 grams a month. Smoking pot has long been legal in Uruguay, but growing, carrying, buying, or selling have not. The measure, intended to wrest control of the market from illegal dealers, would make Uruguay the first country in the world to license and enforce rules for the production, distribution, and sale of marijuana.",Uruguay's Plan: Sell an Eighth of Pot for $3.50

The 25-year-old is the first female fixed-wing pilot in her country's air force, but she says she has received death threats both from Taliban insurgents and from distant relatives who believe she has disgraced the family, the Times of London reports. Rahmani, who became famous in her homeland after graduating from a pilot training program run by the US-led coalition, finished another 15 months of training in the US last week and has applied for asylum in the US, saying that she would love to fly for her country, but she's scared for her life, the Wall Street Journal reports. Rahmani, who was honored with the State Department's Women of Courage Award in 2015, says distant relatives outraged by her career choice have tried to kill her brother and have forced her family to move several times. She tells the Journal that if she's allowed to stay in the US, she will fly either for the US Air Force or as a commercial pilot.  Everything I went through, all my suffering, was because I really wanted to fly. That was my dream,  she says. She also says she was harassed and treated with contempt by male Afghan colleagues, though a Defense Ministry spokesman accuses her of lying, reports the New York Times.

"(Aug 30, 2014  3:19 PM CDT) The US Coast Guard has lost track of a Kurdish tanker carrying $100 million in disputed oil off the coast of Texas, the Independent reports. Headed for Galveston, the United Kalavyrvta was anchored at least 60 miles off-shore when it vanished from radar screens. The ship's haul fell under legal dispute when Iraq filed a lawsuit in US courts, urging American officials to grab the ship's oil in Galveston because it belongs to Iraq, not the Kurdish National Government. But Kurds say it's theirs, and insist they need oil-export dollars to survive and fund their future independence, the Washington Post reports. In any case, a US court denied the lawsuit Monday because America has no jurisdiction over ships more than 60 miles off the coast. Meanwhile, the United Kalavyrvta may have moved beyond US antennas or could be suffering technical problems, the US Coast Guard says (or maybe it  voluntarily switched off its transmitter,  says the Daily News).

PotatoStock 2014 was held in downtown Columbus and featured bands, food trucks, beer vendors, and, yes, plenty of potato salad.

"(Nov 18, 2020  4:57 PM) A Vancouver lawyer must be licking his wounds after taking his scorned-love case to court and losing big time, the CBC reports. Dongdong Huang claimed Peipei Li duped him into thinking they were in love and marriage-bound so he would lavish her with over $1 million in gifts and cash—but a judge said Huang was just infatuated. His behavior with Li was sometimes  obsessive and borderline (at least) stalking,  BC Supreme Court Justice Elaine Adair wrote Monday in a judgment.  In my opinion, Dr. Huang's assertions that Ms. Li represented she was in love with him and available for a long-term spousal relationship with him are a product of Dr. Huang's imagination and his infatuation with Ms. Li.  Huang, who's also a published poet, wrote a poem about her titled  Long-awaited Puppy Love.  Adair based her ruling partly on WeChat messages in which Li gave Huang the cold shoulder ( I have clearly expressed my thoughts that I will not be with you,  Li wrote) and photos Huang took of her wearing a big diamond engagement ring—which he apparently ignored. Adair acknowledged that Li shouldn't have let Huang wire her family in China $580,000, but said it wasn't tantamount to fraud. As for Li, the South China Morning Post reports that she dove into a whirlwind Vegas marriage with Chinese tech tycoon Luhua Rao in 2016 only to find he had a wife and family back in China. That marriage flamed out in a divorce and a lawsuit over millions of dollars in cash and assets.

"(Feb 13, 2018  12:08 PM) Though there's no indication it'll be any more successful than the many complaints it follows, a federal lawsuit is challenging the Trump administration's policy of banning marijuana at the federal level—and is led by a 12-year-old girl. The case brought against the Justice Department by five plaintiffs—including Alexis Bortell, who uses medical marijuana to treat her epilepsy, and former NFL player Marvin Washington, who sells marijuana-based pain relievers—heads to a New York court on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. The case before Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein has what Fresh Toast calls  immense promise  for pot advocates, as plaintiffs argue that current law classifying marijuana as among the most dangerous narcotics violates constitutional rights. Filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan in July, the suit gained increased attention after Jeff Sessions last month opened up the option for prosecutors to enforce federal law in states where marijuana has been decriminalized. The lawsuit claims the Schedule 1 drug has been used by everyone from Thomas Jefferson, who apparently found it eased his migraines, to ancient Egyptians, who used it to treat eye sores and hemorrhoids, and is only banned based on efforts to target hippies and black Americans after the 1960s. The Cannabis Cultural Association, another plaintiff in the suit, argues  the Controlled Substances Act has been enforced against people of color exponentially more than Caucasians,  a lawyer tells the Cannabis Business Times.

"(Oct 20, 2017  12:11 PM CDT) A massive recall, followed by a $50 million wrongful-death settlement payment last year, seemed to mark the beginning of the end for an Ikea disaster that left several toddlers dead after they were crushed by dressers that fell on them. But NPR reports yet another toddler—said to be the eighth child who's died due to an Ikea-linked tip-over—has been killed. A press release notes that while 2-year-old Jozef Dudek was in his bedroom in Buena Park, Calif., on May 24, put down for a nap by his dad, a Malm dresser fell on top of him; his father found Jozef underneath the dresser when he went to check on him. One of the Dudeks' attorneys says Jozef's parents had no idea their dresser was part of the recall, while another, Alan Feldman, says the recall was  poorly publicized by IKEA and ineffective in getting these defective and unstable dressers out of children's bedrooms.  Ikea has been offering either refunds for the returned furniture, or a wall-mounting kit to secure the dressers and chests. In what seems apparent, a statement from an Ikea rep cited in the Philadelphia Inquirer says the dresser in Jozef's room was not attached to the wall. The Inquirer goes on to note that, per a Consumer Product Safety Commission report filed for the period ending Jan. 1, about 882,500 dressers had been recalled—around 3% of the total affected by the recall. The director of the Kids in Danger nonprofit says Ikea should be doing more to promote the recall, telling ABC News:  We have to do better, because these are just ticking land mines in a child's bedroom.

But the 32-year-old tells NBC News' Today Show she was raped by Epstein at age 15; she never went to police, but she says she did tell four people, who confirmed her account to NBC. Her story starts in New York City in the fall of 2001. She says a woman in her 20s came up to her outside her Upper East Side high school and struck up a series of conversations, asking the then-freshman about her family (her father had died of AIDS a couple years earlier) and financial situation. Araoz says the woman eventually brought up a well-off man who was a sort of father-figure for her and lived not far from the school. That  had meaning for me at that time because I was maybe longing for that,  says Araoz. She says the woman introduced her to Epstein, and that initially the three of them visited together; Epstein impressed upon her the donations he made to AIDS charities, and she was given $300 at the end of each visit. The first time the woman didn't join her, things changed. Araoz alleges Epstein gave her a home tour, ending with his  favorite room,  which she describes as containing a massage table and a painting of a naked young woman; she says he told her the painting reminded him of her. She says he then coerced her into massaging him wearing only panties. As the visits—which his secretary allegedly scheduled once or twice a week—progressed, she says he began to masturbate during the massages.

The video, taken in Alaska’s Neacola Mountains, was footage to be used in Teton Gravity Research's film Paradise Waits, but the mountain had other plans for the 26-year-old Utah skier, reports the Alaska Dispatch News. The video shows Collinson start her run, only to hit a patch of icy snow and tumble 1,000 vertical feet down the mountain, careening for 25 white-knuckle seconds.  Being the badass that she is, Angel came out unscathed, but the footage will leave you wondering how she escaped without injury,  reads the description posted by TGR under the YouTube video, promoted during the company's Safety Week 2016 to inform other backcountry athletes of such dangers.

"(Dec 4, 2018  5:17 PM) The city of Norfolk has agreed to pay $4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the  Norfolk Four  was obtained by the AP. The state also has agreed to pay $3.5 million. The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former FBI agents, ex-prosecutors, and crime novelist John Grisham.  These guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives,  said Tony Troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors.

"(Jun 22, 2011  10:05 AM CDT) A street sign in Brooklyn honoring seven firefighters who died on 9/11 has gotten the thumbs down from a New York atheist group, reports the Village Voice. The problem? The sign ceremonially renames Richards Street  Seven in Heaven Way,  and the NYC Atheists say that any reference to heaven on a government sign violates the separation of church and state.  The problem with the sign is that you're assuming that you know what they felt deep down,  says the group's president, who tells Fox News Radio that he might sue if it isn't removed.  You're assuming they even believed in heaven.   The attacks on 9-11 were an attack on America,  adds the president of American Atheists, who has called for the sign to be taken down.  They were an attack on our Constitution and breaking that Constitution to honor these firefighters is the wrong thing to do.  But some city officials are peeved about the timing of the controversy.  I think it’s a little late in the process for someone to be bringing this up now,  says one. And a rep for one city councilmember tells Gothamist,  The seven heroes have long been known as the 'Seven in Heaven.' It is the way the community and their families chose to remember them.

He was shot and killed after coalition forces returned fire.

"(Sep 5, 2011  12:32 PM CDT) When Cynthia Daily, her partner, and their son vacation with other families,  it's wild,  she says. The kids  all look alike.  That's because Daily turned to a sperm donor seven years ago; using the number assigned to her donor, she later searched an online registry for her son's half-siblings, some of whom her family now holidays with. Turns out there are 150 of these kids, and that number is growing. While Daily's son's clan is one of the biggest groups of brothers and sisters to share one donor dad, it's becoming less of an anomaly, reports the New York Times, which says 50-plus-member groups are appearing more frequently in online registries. The concerns are growing in number, too. Some worry of the potential for rare genetic diseases to spread throughout the population. Others fear the real possibility of accidental incest, as unwitting half-brothers and half-sisters often live near the same sperm bank—and each other.  My daughter knows her donor’s number for this very reason,  says the mother of one teen.  She’s had crushes on boys who are donor children. It’s become part of [her] sex education.

The Labor Department also had grim news for the previous two months: The economy did not create nearly as many jobs as was originally thought, and those figures have been revised down to show 49,000 fewer jobs created. That means we're averaging 73,000 jobs per month for the last two months, which is just one-third of the jobs added per month in the first quarter, the AP reports.  This is bad.

"(Jun 7, 2012  9:10 AM CDT) Within weeks of Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency, his party is following up on threats to crack down on anti-government protesters. Both houses of Russia's parliament have backed vastly increased fines against  unauthorized  demonstrations; Putin is expected to sign the measure into law within days. The law sets a maximum penalty of $9,300 or 200 hours of community service for individuals involved in such protests; the fine had been just $60. Event organizers, meanwhile, could pay $30,000, according to the Voice of America. Some 38% of Russians oppose the bill, whose fines are higher than the country's average income; two-thirds say it's time for talks between Putin and the opposition, notes the Moscow Times. The move comes ahead of a giant rally set for Tuesday, der Spiegel reports. The measure was introduced following protests against Putin's potential 12 years in office. Meanwhile, protests are continuing, with 10 detained yesterday—and the bill could backfire, prompting more Russians to take to the streets. But the only reason Putin wouldn't sign the bill is if it opposes European free speech rules, a rep says.",Putin to OK $9K Fines on 'Unauthorized' Rallies

"(Nov 24, 2012  10:44 AM) The crack epidemic that began in the 1980s ushered in a wave of bloodletting in the nation's capital and a death toll that ticked upward daily. Dead bodies, sometimes several a night, had homicide detectives hustling between crime scenes and earned Washington unwelcome monikers such as the nation's  murder capital.  At the time, some feared the murder rate might ascend to more frightening heights. But after approaching nearly 500 slayings a year in the early 1990s, the annual rate has gradually declined to the point that the city is now on the verge of a once-unthinkable milestone. The number of 2012 killings in the District of Columbia stands at 78 and is on pace to finish lower than 100 for the first time since 1963, police records show.  It strikes me probably daily as I ride around the city, or sometimes when I'm sitting at home at night, and it's 10 o'clock and my phone's not ringing,  says Police Chief Cathy Lanier, who joined the department amid violent 1991 street riots. The drop reflects a downward trend in violent crime nationwide and is in line with declining homicides in other big cities. Though killings have risen in Chicago, New York City officials say homicides dropped to 515 last year from more than 2,200 in 1990. Houston reported 198 homicides last year, down from 457 in 1985, while Los Angeles police reported fewer than 300 last year after ending 1992 with about 1,100.

"(Mar 10, 2014  8:14 AM CDT) Since protests started in Ukraine last December, 661 people have been reported missing—and 272 are still unaccounted for as of last week. This even after opposition members have been given the go-ahead to look for them in prisons, morgues, and hospitals. The figure comes courtesy of Euromaidan SOS, whose coordinator predicts that most of those still missing will resurface. But the New York Times reports that the fear that some, or perhaps many, of the missing could have vanished at the hands of the brutal Berkut riot police, or pro-Russian or pro-Yanukovich forces, still persists, and it cites two cases as contributing to that fear. One opposition activist was abducted from a Kiev hospital and later found dead in a forest; a man abducted with him says their kidnappers spoke Russian and seemed like police officers. Another opposition organizer was abducted in late January, and though he turned up alive, he said he had been tortured by people he thought were members of Russia's special services. The Euromaidan SOS coordinator insists that rumors of authorities burning bodies of dozens they killed are likely false, yet he notes that bloodstains were found at some police stations where protesters were held. DNA tests are needed, he says, but  this is a huge amount of work, and there is some chance that the police will not do it.",272 Protesters Have Vanished in Ukraine

The refinery supplies 16% of the region's gas, and prices have already jumped from an average of $3.86 to $3.94 in California, analysts say—though a Chevron rep says the blast isn't the only cause of such increases. Still, it could be weeks before normal production is resumed. Investigators—including those who reviewed the BP oil spill—are launching five separate probes to see what caused the explosion and how it could play out. The explosion damaged a section of the refinery that produces clean-burning gasoline, and  California has the cleanest-burning gas in the nation, so this is definitely a market disruption,  says one analyst.

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch held up an EpiPen as she told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that she wishes the company had  better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration  of the rising prices for some families.  We never intended this,  she said, but maintained that her company doesn't make much profit from each emergency allergy shot. The list price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500% since 2007. Republicans and Democrats have said families struggling to pay for the shots have every right to be angry at Mylan. Opening the hearing, House Oversight Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said high executive pay at Mylan  doesn't add up for a lot of people  as the EpiPen price has increased. Chaffetz said executives for the company made $300 million over five years while the list price for a pair of the emergency allergy shots rose.  Parents don't have a choice,  Chaffetz said.  If your loved one needs this, it better darn well be in your backpack.  Bresch said the company makes only $50 in profit on each EpiPen. But Chaffetz said he finds that  a little hard to believe.

Hillary Clinton's solution: a $350 billion proposal whose goals include making community college free, cutting costs to attend four-year public schools, and slashing interest rates on student loans, the AP reports. Under the  New College Compact —which Politico notes would spread the $350 billion cost over 10 years—colleges that offer free tuition at community colleges and affordable tuition at four-year schools would be eligible for federal funds from a $200 billion federal  incentive  coffer, per the AP. The plan also addresses refinancing for current borrowers, as well as assistance for nontraditional students.  A presidential election is the time to consider broad changes to public policy, and this is a big, bold, and complex proposal,  the president of the American Council on Education tells Politico. Clinton's plan, designed to court younger voters, isn't a total  free ride  proposal, the AP notes: Clinton's aides say that while low-income students, veterans, and other qualifying students would indeed attend certain institutions for free, most families would still need to pitch in a  realistic  amount, while students would also contribute wages. Politico notes, however, the GOP isn't exactly applauding the plan, which would be paid for by capping tax deductions for the wealthy.

They're investing $5 per ton in a $1.5 million campaign to attack the dried cranberries, whose sales climbed 13.4% in 2010 compared to a year earlier; raisins saw sales drop 2.4%. The campaign has launched a website called  Let's Keep It Real,  which aims to reveal  the truth about Craisins.  While Craisins are dried, split, and sugar-injected, raisins are simply dried grapes, the Times notes.  It's gone too far. They're not even real food. They're a dried cranberry skin that's at least 40% added sugar. We had to do something,  says a raisin advocate.  Sure, they add a spot of color. But why not just put M&Ms on your salad?

"(Nov 9, 2011  2:22 PM) In a Today interview airing tomorrow and Friday, Dr. Conrad Murray finally explains why he didn’t call 911 as soon as Michael Jackson stopped breathing—although his explanation may still leave you with a few questions. Emergency responders wouldn’t have been able to come through the gate, the doctor claimed:  No one is allowed to come upstairs except for Mr. Jackson.  When Savannah Guthrie pointed out that Murray could have called Jackson’s bodyguard and asked him to meet them at the gate, Murray said he didn’t want to  leave a full explanation on the phone  and started CPR instead. Murray’s interview coincides with the release of the MSNBC documentary Michael Jackson and the Doctor on Friday. Australia’s News Network reports that the documentary reveals Jackson’s last words to Murray:  Let me have some milk,  a reference to the white-colored propofol.  He was pleading, and begging me, to please, please, let him have some milk,  Murray says in the documentary.  That was the only thing that would work. He really could not sleep.

"(Jan 28, 2013  7:46 AM) Despite President Mohamed Morsi declaring a state of emergency yesterday, protests are raging in Cairo and other parts of Egypt for a fifth consecutive day today, the New York Times reports. Marchers in Port Said, one of three provinces where Morsi declared a curfew, said they no longer recognize his authority and called on everyone to ignore the curfew. Opposition groups have called for more protests throughout Egypt today to mark the two-year anniversary of the  Day of Rage,  a brutal day of clashes during the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Protests began last week to mark the two-year anniversary of the uprising, then grew over the weekend after 21 people involved in a soccer riot were sentenced to death. In addition to the state of emergency, one of the most hated Mubarak-era laws still in effect, al-Jazeera reports that Egypt's Cabinet has given the army the right to arrest civilians and act alongside police; the upper house of parliament must still ratify the draft law. Morsi has invited opposition leaders to a  national dialogue  tonight, and initial reports indicated they would participate. But now the Guardian reports that the National Salvation Front, the country's opposition coalition, has rejected the plan. Leading member Mohamed ElBaradei called Morsi's offer  cosmetic and not substantive,  Reuters reports.

The Jeddah Tower has already been built to the 26th floor, but there are many more to go; ultimately, the tower will boast 200 floors and stretch a full kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky. The Jeddah Economic Company has signed a $2.2 billion financing deal with Alinma Investment to complete the tower and the surrounding Jeddah City, CNN reports. Upon completion, planned for 2020, it will break the record for the world's tallest building currently held by the 2,716-foot-tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The tower, which will overlook the Red Sea, requires 200-foot-deep foundations in order to ensure the saltwater doesn't damage them. The tower will also change shape every few floors so that the wind won't buffet the building as badly as it would a solid block, one of the architects on the project explained to Construction Weekly in 2011. It will require 80,000 tons of steel and 5.7 million square feet of concrete.",Saudi Arabia: We'll Have World's Tallest Building by 2020

"(Dec 16, 2014  11:12 PM) After just three hours of deliberation, a federal jury decided yesterday that Apple didn't compete unfairly when it sold music players and songs with copy-protection software that was incompatible with rival devices and music from competing online stores. The jury handed Apple a victory by rejecting a claim from attorneys for consumers and iPod resellers, who were seeking as much as $1 billion in a class-action lawsuit, arguing that Apple was able to overcharge consumers for iPods by making it difficult to switch to a rival music player. During the trial, the plaintiffs' attorneys played a video of testimony by Steve Jobs, the late Apple CEO. They also showed emails between Apple executives that indicated they were concerned about some early efforts by rival companies to sell digital music files that might be played on iPods. But Apple executives testified they were focused on preventing unauthorized copying—which was a big concern of recording labels—and said Apple was worried that digital files from outside sources might compromise the security of its iTunes software. Apple no longer uses the copy-protection software in question, so the ruling has no effect on the company's current practices.",Apple Wins $1B iTunes Case

"(Oct 13, 2010  6:35 AM CDT) For many Americans,  recovery  feels a lot like recession—and it may take a decade for that to change, finds the New York Times. At the current rate of job creation, for instance, it would take nine years to recapture jobs lost thus far. Home prices, meanwhile, are down 20% since 2005; even assuming 2% inflation, it would take 13 years for the market to reach pre-crisis levels. Everywhere, offices sit empty.

If somebody called from a country, Norway, 'We have information on your opponent'—oh, I think I'd want to hear it.

The scariest part? Such a sight might become more familiar. The video arose because melting permafrost caused a long-frozen reindeer carcass to thaw and release anthrax bacteria. Now scientists are worried that more dangers lurk in the permafrost, including smallpox, which killed up to 30% of those infected before it was eradicated around the world in 1977, per the Independent. A researcher tells the Siberian Times that up to 40% of residents of a Siberian town died in a 1890s smallpox epidemic and  were buried under the upper layer of permafrost, on the bank of the Kolmya River.  Now  Kolmya's floodwaters have started eroding the banks.  Experts say they've already found bodies with smallpox-like sores along with fragments of the virus' DNA. Boris Kershengolts of the Institute for Biological Problems of Cryolithozone says there's  reason enough to finance research into the diagnostics and prevention of exceptionally dangerous infections,  adding that the graves of anthrax-infected cattle can also be found across Russia, including in areas where the ground has thawed two feet deeper than normal. Deadly diseases aren't the only concern.

"(Mar 10, 2016  8:04 AM) Hackers helped themselves to $81 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last month—but the massive theft could have been far worse if not for a typo, reports Reuters. Investigators say the heist began when the hackers breached the security systems of Bangladesh Bank and then, posing as the Bangladeshi bankers, requested dozens of large transfers from the New York Fed. About $81 million had gone through to entities in the Philippines before red flags up went because the hackers had written  fandation  instead of  foundation  on one of the transfers. Routing bank Deutsche Bank caught the error, got suspicious, and alerted the Bangladesh central bank, which put a stop to the transfer. In total, hackers had put in almost three dozen transfer requests and planned to steal another $850 million to $870 million. A Bangladeshi official tells the Wall Street Journal that  some  money has been recovered, but the hackers—who experts suspect are from outside Bangladesh and spied on bank workers to gain information on the bank's systems—remain at large. The Fed, however, may face consequences. Bangladesh's finance minister says the country is considering a lawsuit against the American bank for not stopping the transactions earlier.

"(Aug 12, 2017  3:52 PM CDT) In March 1945, 83 German prisoners of war escaped a prison camp in South Wales. It was the biggest escape of German prisoners during World War II, and now—thanks to a report published earlier this month in the Journal of Conflict Archaeology—we know how they did it. Camp 198 in Bridgend was built to house 1,600 German officers and was one of what were ultimately 1,026 camps—numbered sequentially—in the UK, the Conversation reports. The conditions at Camp 198 no doubt made escape not only inviting but also possible: The report notes  camp security measures were generally poor,  with  lack of either sentry towers and perimeter fence lighting, and this provided good cover for escape tunnels to be constructed.  Researchers using ground-based surface scanning, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistivity discovered the location of a tunnel originating in Camp 198's Hut 9, which was preserved for scientists to study when the rest of the camp was demolished in the 1990s. The tunnel was relatively shallow—less than 5 feet below ground. And while its entrance was sealed by concrete, the inside was  remarkably intact,  with the walls and ceiling still supported by bed posts and other items from the prisoners' huts. Researchers also found a false wall in a shower room behind which the prisoners had hidden the dirt removed from the tunnel. None of the 83 German POWs who escaped Camp 198 made it back to Germany.

Now the Lebanese-American businessman is in the news for a very different reason: He's accused of transporting child pornography. The 60-year-old was arrested Monday at JFK Airport, and CNN notes that he pleaded guilty to the same charge back in 1991. This time, he faces 15 to 40 years in prison if convicted. Mueller had been interested in Nader because he  played an unusual role as a kind of liaison between Trump supporters, Middle East leaders and Russians interested in making contact with the incoming administration in early 2017,  per the Washington Post. Specifically, Mueller wanted to hear about a meeting Nader arranged in January 2017 in Seychelles between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian banker close to Vladimir Putin. Nader's testimony raised doubts about Prince's assertion that it was a chance encounter. According to the criminal complaint against him on the child pornography charges, federal agents stopped Nader at Dulles airport in DC in January 2018, and one of his phones was searched. Agents say they found sexually explicit videos involving young boys, though Nader was not charged in that matter (secretly) until April 2018, when he was out of the country.

The four-foot-long fish eater resembles a small alligator and likely belongs to an extinct offshoot of the four-legged family tree. The fossil is 365 million years old—predating dinosaurs by 100 million years.  I imagine this is an animal that could haul itself over sand banks without any difficulty.

"(Jul 15, 2013  8:21 AM CDT) A 73-year-old black soul singer in California got roughed up Saturday by a woman in the audience who rushed the stage after he dedicated a song to Trayvon Martin, say police. Lester Chambers was talking about the George Zimmerman trial and about to play  People Get Ready  when a white woman leaped at him, shouting,  It's your fault,  witnesses tell the San Jose Mercury News. Dinalynn Andrews Potter, 43, was arrested on suspicion of battery, and the Chambers family is pushing police to file hate-crime charges, too.  She had a crazed look in her eye,  says one of the musician's friends who rushed to help him. Chambers suffered a bruised rib and nerve damage and is  sore all over,  according to a Facebook post by his son.  People Get Ready  is a Curtis Mayfield song written after MLK's march on Washington, and Chambers' old group, the Chambers Brothers, recorded a version in 1967, notes Firedog Lake.

"(Jan 23, 2017  9:21 AM) If you thought PG-13 movies were less violent than R-rated flicks, think again. More gun violence plays out on the big screen in movies open to all ages than in R-rated box office blockbusters, reports FastCo.Exist. Researchers found that gun violence in PG-13 action movies is on the rise with Hollywood increasingly relying on shoot-'em-up scenes to fill seats. Building on an earlier study, they sampled 30 top-grossing films between 2012 and 2015 to determine the number of five-minute segments in which a character fires a gun at someone. Writing in the journal Pediatrics, they report the rate of gun violence in PG-13 movies in 2012 equaled that of R-rated films, restricted to 17 and older, and outpaced those films in later years. Kids of all ages are allowed into cinemas showing PG-13 movies, though parents are  strongly cautioned.  Some of the most violent PG-13 films were some of the most popular like 2015's Star Wars: the Force Awakens.  (See the full list here.) Of note: The authors say films often remove the consequences of gunplay. Thus, children and their parents are being  desensitized  to these effects, they contend, comparing on-screen bloodshed to behaviors like smoking and drinking that can young people often imitate. Previous research has shown that repeated exposure to violence on screen can make kids more aggressive.  We know less about the potential effects of films that glorify the use of guns,  the authors write. Until more is known, they say, pediatricians should advise parents  to be cautious about exposing their children  to violent films.

"(Nov 27, 2013  8:35 AM) Eerie: A documentary crew caught two of the captives recently rescued in London on film, ever so briefly, in 1997. The ITV documentary focused on the death of a woman who fell from the window of a house used by the alleged slavery commune that year, the Telegraph reports. Investigators are now re-examining the death of Sian Davies, the Mirror notes; her cousin says she was missing for years and  must have been trying to escape  when she fell. She was a member of the  Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought  commune, the Raw Story reports, and the 30-year-old woman recently rescued is thought to be her daughter. The documentary filmmakers wanted to speak to commune leader Aravindan Balakrishnan, one of the alleged slaveholders arrested in the captivity case. But, in the video, one of the now-rescued women says the video crew is  part of the fascist state  and another says they don't want to talk and closes the door.

"(Dec 21, 2011  7:01 AM) The predictions are getting worse: Japanese officials today said that it could take as many as 40 years to decommission the Fukushima nuclear plant, upping the previous estimate of 30 years. According to the detailed roadmap, TEPCO intends to spend the next two years clearing the spent fuel rods out of the storage pools situated in the reactor buildings; but the lion's share of the time will go to removing the melted nuclear fuel. That process will take some 25 years, and will necessitate the use of robots—and technologies that haven't even been invented yet, reports the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal zeroes in on one of the toughest steps in the process: Figuring out how to drain thousands of tons of irradiated water from the reactor buildings' basements. The cracks that the earthquake created in these buildings will then be repaired, allowing the reactors to be refilled with water, which must occur before the melted fuel can be removed from them. Once that process is complete, it'll be another five to 10 years until the reactors are completely decommissioned.",Japan: 40 Years to Fully Shut Down Fukushima

"(Apr 29, 2019  5:00 PM CDT)  No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else,  President Trump insisted on Friday. That may be the case, but the former North Korea envoy tells CNN he did indeed sign an agreement to pay Pyongyang $2 million for Warmbier's hospital care, and he believes his authorization to do so came from Trump. Joseph Yun never interacted with the president. But as the State Department Special Representative for North Korea, he said he contacted his boss at the time—Rex Tillerson—and told him the North was insisting on the payment. Tillerson  got back to me very quickly thereafter to say yes, go ahead and sign.  Though he did not ask Tillerson, Yun's  understanding  was that Tillerson had gotten Trump's OK. National security adviser John Bolton wasn't part of the administration at the time but confirmed on Sunday that he was told a pledge was indeed signed. When asked by Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday whether the payment has ever been made, Bolton said,  Absolutely not, and that's the key point.

Just days after being removed from office by the Constitutional Court over a massive corruption scandal, an animal rights group accused Park of animal abandonment for not bringing the dogs with her, the AP reports. Park's neighbors had given her a pair of Jindo dogs, a Korean breed of hunting dogs, when she left for the presidential Blue House in 2013. The dogs recently gave birth to seven puppies, which are now considered too young to be separated from their mother, a Blue House spokesman says. The spokesman says the dogs will stay at the presidential palace until they're ready to be sent to new owners. Park told staff members to take good care of the dogs before vacating the Blue House on Sunday, he says. Park's decision to leave the dogs behind touched off a heated reaction from dog lovers, who flooded social media with angry remarks. Kim Ae Ra, who heads the Korea Alliance for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the group filed a complaint Monday with South Korea's Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission over Park's dogs. The commission then asked the National Police Agency to look into it. Animal abandonment is punishable by a fine of up to $873.

For DHS: retired four-star Marine Gen. John Kelly, sources close to the transition team tell the AP. Kelly, who oversaw Gitmo, is the third retired general Donald Trump has tapped so far, the Hill notes; he joins Gen. James Mattis for secretary of defense and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security adviser. Kelly, 66—whose son lost his life fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010—stepped down from his post in February and was reportedly chosen because of his  Southwest border expertise,  per the Washington Post.

"(May 14, 2014  6:53 AM CDT) The late Earl Van Best Jr. was the Zodiac Killer, at least according to his own son. HarperCollins yesterday released a book by Gary L. Stewart that got a quick avalanche of press, due in part to the fact that the publisher managed to keep the lid on the book for a year. The Most Dangerous Animal of All is the result of Stewart's 12-year search for his biological father, a quest launched when his birth mother made contact with him in 2002. As NOLA.com reports, Jude Gilford married Best, then 27, when she was 13. The two fled San Francisco, and Gilford gave birth to Stewart in 1963; Best left him in a Baton Rouge apartment building when he was four weeks old. Best was ultimately jailed through July 1965 after facing charges of raping a minor and document and wire fraud. Gilford never spoke with him again (interestingly, she ended up marrying a San Francisco Police Department detective who worked on the Zodiac Killer case). The Zodiac Killer first struck in Northern California in 1968; Best died in 1984. The 51-year-old Stewart tells People that the book is the result of some 500 interviews and holds what he sees as evidence of his father's guilt: a similarity between his father's fingerprints and one left at the crime scene; a comparison of his father's handwriting from his parents' marriage certificate with that of letters written by the killer that a handwriting expert found to be  virtually  the same; the victims' resemblance to Gilford. Further, many of the Zodiac Killer's letters were directed to Chronicle reporter Paul Avery, who had written critically of Best after he married the teen. But there's one thing Stewart hasn't been able to do: Compare his DNA to what the SFPD had among its evidence; he says he's unsuccessfully lobbied for such a comparison for a decade.

Sioux Falls police exhumed the child's body a decade ago to obtain DNA samples. No matches were found in a state database, but a private genealogy company had more luck, which helped detectives to build a family tree that led them to Bentaas. The affadavit says she told police she was  young and stupid  at the time. She hid the pregnancy, she said, gave birth alone at home, then drove to the cornfield. Police said the infant  slowly succumbed to exposure.  Bentaas and the child's father, who is not charged in the case, have two adult children. Sioux Falls residents came together to give Andrew, as newspapers at the time called him, a funeral in March 1981.

As the Boston Globe reports,  For the first time in more than a decade, unencumbered by political considerations, (Romney) was free to spend his many millions without concern of how it might look.  And Romney went big with his homes: He pushed ahead with plans to raze aforementioned beach house in La Jolla, Calif., erecting a $12 million, 11,000-square-foot behemoth, complete with  a lift inside that will rotate two cars below grade to the basement area.  He bought an 8,730-square-foot home in Park City, Utah, that had what the Globe calls a  massive stone fireplace large enough to hold stockings for nearly two dozen grandchildren  and an accompanying $8.9 million price tag. And he built another 30 miles away near Salt Lake City, this one a farmhouse valued at $1.2 million. His fourth residence is a vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee, NH, which he's owned since 1997. All of which is a little tricky when one is considering a third run for the Oval Office, this time with an emphasis on poverty.  He wants to be close to his family,  says a longtime friend.

"(Nov 3, 2014  2:35 PM) Bill Anderson, 44, had bariatric surgery in May 2008 at Michigan's Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital to help him gain control of his weight. He eventually got down to about 250 pounds from 459 and has since run two full marathons and more than a dozen half-marathons, the  Detroit Free Press  reports. Crysta Danaher, 34, had the same procedure done in March 2009 and whittled 180 pounds from her frame. They both started attending a support group at the hospital, which led to the biggest loss of all: their single status after marrying each other on Saturday.  We were friends first,  Danaher tells the Free Press.  My mom knew him first and always said, 'I wish you'd meet a guy like Bill.' He grew on me. I guess I grew on him, too.  The couple met in Multi Purpose Room A, where they opened up with others about their weight struggles in a  soul-baring  environment, as a hospital spokeswoman puts it.  There was a group of them that really formed a bond,  she says. Anderson proposed to Danaher at the New York City Marathon last year, and it was only natural for them to get married in the same room where they used to congregate at the hospital; the yoga instructor who helps them work out officiated. The two encourage each other to stick to a healthy lifestyle, avoiding carbs and splitting servings when they go out to eat.  We're a cheap date,  Danaher says. They'll be honeymooning in Cancun, where they say they might splurge a little, the new bride admits:  We're probably both going to be hurting on the honeymoon because we'll try things we shouldn't.

"(Nov 19, 2012  11:32 AM) The US gross domestic product appears to have actually grown at a 2.9% annual rate between July and September, the fastest quarterly growth seen this year. That rate, via analysts at Goldman Sachs and Barclays, is higher than the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 2.0%—and it suggests the economy will take Hurricane Sandy's damage in stride. Improving housing and job markets, as well as better household finances, are spurring consumer confidence and spending, Bloomberg notes. The growth  doesn’t make us invulnerable,  notes a Barclays executive.  But it’s better than if the economy had already been slowing sharply and then we were hit  with events like Sandy. The hurricane could cut half a percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP, says the Goldman exec, and the fiscal cliff also poses a threat. But with  solid momentum  going into the fourth quarter, the US economy should be able to keep growing, says the Barclays economist.  The economy is somewhat stronger than people are giving it credit for,  notes an ING director. Any upward revision to Q3 GDP will be reported on Nov. 29.",Q3's GDP Growth Could Be Rosiest of Year

The Health and Human Services Department has a limited budget to track the welfare of vulnerable unaccompanied minors, and realized that 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, an agency official says. Federal officials came under fire two years ago after rolling back child protection policies meant for minors fleeing violence in Central America.

(Watch the capsule, attached to four parachutes, touch down in the water here.) The flight from the International Space Station took about six hours, the AP reports.

A lifelong insomniac, Staver gave up attempting to sleep like a regular person in 1998. She and a friend—inspired by a 1943 Time interview with inventor Buckminster Fuller—developed the  Uberman  sleep schedule, so named because  they were accomplishing so much in a day that they were freaking people out; their schoolwork was done, their dorms were clean, they held down jobs, they made appearances at social events.  They would wake up at 4am to study at Denny's then take 20-minute naps every four hours, getting a total of two hours of sleep every day.  I felt the best I’ve ever felt in my life,  Staver tells Motherboard. Not that it was easy. The first two weeks of Uberman are an  absolute unholy monstrous biyotch,  Motherboard quotes a 2006 blog post by Staver. That adjustment period can cause moodiness, chills, constant hunger, and worse. Regardless, Staver unwittingly kicked off a  polyphasic sleep  movement, with followers pestering her for information and advice. She eventually created a blog and wrote a book for people interested in Uberman.

He was 82. Leibman's agent, Robert Attermann, said the actor died Friday. He gave no further details, but a person who knew the actor said the cause was pneumonia. In his lengthy career, Leibman played a huge variety of roles, both dramatic and comic. He appeared in numerous films, including Norma Rae, opposite Sally Field, and Slaughterhouse-Five.

An agency official in Boston won't identify the two men suspected of dressing up as police officers to rob the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, but he tells the AP that  great investigative work  solved the case several years ago.  So now the focus of the investigation is the recovery of the art.  The pair got away with 13 priceless paintings from the likes of Rembrandt and Vermeer.  Every lead, every tip, everything that comes in we're tracking down, no matter where it is in the area, in the country or overseas,  says Peter Kowenhoven.  These are cultural masterpieces that we are trying to recover.  The video is from the night before the robbery, and it shows a security guard identified as Richard Abath letting a man inside the museum, against protocol. Was it simply a weird coincidence? Abath, who now lives in Vermont, has long denied any involvement but has never made secret his presence during the robbery, during which he and another guard were allegedly tied up.

The Centre for Cold Ocean Research Engineering and Norwegian energy company Statoil recently kicked off the Iceberg Classifier Challenge to find an  algorithm that automatically identifies if a remotely sensed target is a ship or iceberg.  According to the competition home page, in areas with extremely harsh weather, aerial reconnaissance and shore-based support systems may not be feasible, meaning companies and organizations must rely on satellites to identify objects in the water.

"(Feb 3, 2015  9:18 AM) Pope Francis decreed today that slain Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero was killed out of hatred for the faith, approving a martyrdom declaration that sets the stage for his beatification. Romero, the archbishop of San Salvador, was gunned down by right-wing death squads in 1980 while celebrating Mass. He had spoken out against repression by the Salvadoran army at the beginning of the country's 1980-1992 civil war between the right-wing government and leftist rebels. His sainthood cause had been held up by the Vatican for years out of concern at his perceived association with liberation theology, the Latin American-inspired Catholic theology advocating for the poor. But Francis  unblocked  the cause soon after being elected. Unlike regular candidates for beatification, martyrs can reach the first step to possible sainthood without a miracle attributed to their intercession. A miracle is needed for canonization, however. Traditionally, the church has restricted the martyr designation to people who were killed out of hatred for the Catholic faith. One of the reasons Romero's case had lagged was over questions about whether he was killed for his politics in support of the poor or for his faith. The decree signed by Francis makes clear that Romero was a martyr in the classic sense, killed out of hatred for the faith. No date for the beatification has been set.",Pope OKs Martyrdom for Archbishop Killed in 1980

"(Nov 18, 2016  12:29 PM) Cobb County, Ga., just told the residents of a neighborhood next to the new Atlanta Braves stadium to say goodbye to their homes. The county is using eminent domain to take over at least 16 Turnberry Lane homes, and likely 15 more, and bulldoze them in order to make room for a new four-lane road that will increase access to SunTrust Park, currently under construction. As 11Alive reports, the county has ensured homeowners they will be given fair market value for their homes—but they likely won't be given the amount they could have received for their home had it stayed put and, ultimately, been within walking distance of the new ballpark. Deadspin has more on the contentious background of the new ballpark, including the public paying for it but having no say in the negotiations and the politician behind it getting voted out of office. Sean Breslin, who has championed the new stadium on his blog, is one of the homeowners who will lose his home within months.  So my wife and I will leave our home soon—the only home we’ve ever known, the place where we’ve lived since the summer of 2013, a year before we got married,  he writes.  We’ll find another home, probably in Cobb County, but likely a lot farther up I-75. We’ll pay the same taxes we do now, but we won’t quite feel the changes in the area we’ve anticipated since the Braves made their big announcement.  He doesn't blame the Braves, since the county claims the four-lane road has been a consideration for two decades and is simply of more importance now.

Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the Ontario Provincial Police says reports started filtering in after 11pm of a vehicle that was  all over the highway  just north of Toronto. In a Periscope post on the police department's Twitter page, Schmidt describes how officers went after what they suspected was an  impaired driver,  who first crawled along much slower than the speed limit, then rushed away from cops at more than 75mph. The police were eventually able to box the vehicle in, and were thrown by the kid they found in the driver's seat.  [The boy] had just been finishing playing Grand Theft Auto at home and wanted to find out what it was like driving a car,  Schmidt says. He adds, per Global News:  It's pretty frightening to think of what could have happened, all over the highway with no experience and with the mindset of running from the cops.  Schmidt says no charges are being filed—the OPP is letting his parents decide how best to deal with his behind-the-wheel transgression.

With the help of an army of linguists, naturally. At least, that's the path Netflix has taken in order to get Chelsea (which debuted May 11) to the many-lingual masses. In a Tuesday blog post, the streaming service explains that it ran some 5,000 linguists through the gauntlet and whittled the group down to about 200 who will, in a 12-hour time frame, translate her late-night show into 20 languages.  The test included subtitling clips from Chelsea's Uganda Be Kidding Me, Orange Is the New Black, and House of Cards, so we could see how well they interpreted vulgarities, slang, US-centric political terms, and idioms such as 'she's as tough as a $2 steak,'  the company explained. What they describe sounds like a machine: the creation of one master English template using respeaking technology, as well as people live-streaming the episode as it tapes to  get a jump on identifying tricky phrases, cultural references, or public figures  (it gives examples like  Edumacate Me  and the DMV). Variety notes the whole process—taping to being watchable—happens in about 34 hours, but it points out  the craziest thing about all of this  is that what Netflix has developed is so good that an episode could be ready in 20 hours.  But that would mean that viewers in California would get to see it at 10am, as opposed to midnight ...

For UPS, today will be the busiest day in its history, with 34 million packages to deliver, and it has prepared for it by spending around $500 million on projects, including automated sorting systems that make it a lot easier to train temporary workers, the Wall Street Journal reports. The company hopes the changes will not only help packages arrive on time, but improve profit margins squeezed by the huge increase in online shopping, which means most of its deliveries are now single packages instead of large business orders. FedEx says it is also prepared for the huge rush of deliveries, and like other firms, it has some  weather nerds  on staff to keep deliveries on track.

Police said two people were taken to the hospital in critical condition after being shot by the suspect on North Main about 10pm Saturday. They say the suspect then ran to a Bass Pro Shops and shot a male employee. The condition of that victim is non-critical. Police said the suspect then fled in a vehicle and later struck Smith as he worked to clear the scene. The unidentified suspect is in custody and is expected to face charges. Rallings said Smith was an 18-year police veteran who is survived by a father, fiance, son, and two daughters.  He's a man's man and he was an officer's officer.

Garr Keith Hardin and Jeffrey Dewayne Clark, who spent 24 years in prison in Kentucky after being accused of a satanic murder, had their convictions vacated after a brief hearing Monday in which a judge decided no credible evidence remained against them, the Louisville Courier Journal reports. Hardin, 48, and Clark, 47, were arrested in 1992 after the murder of Rhonda Warford, 19, who was stabbed to death and dumped in a field 50 miles from her home. She had spoken of being harassed by a strange man, but investigators focused on ex-boyfriend Hardin instead. The two men were convicted of her murder in 1995. The men were released from prison in 2016 because of new forensic testing and evidence of police misconduct, the AP reports. Detective Mark Handy, who's accused of fabricating witness statements, is already being sued in connection with several other cases. Both Hardin and Clark have filed federal lawsuits.

His story instantly went viral, he started work on a book with Malcolm Gladwell's literary agent, and actor Russell Brand even joked that he  looks a lot like Jesus.  But there appears to be more to the story, and Price may be more shrewd than purely altruistic. Bloomberg Business reporter Karen Weise, over the course of profiling Price's decision to raise salaries across the board, learned that Price's brother and Gravity shareholder Lucas Price served him with a lawsuit before the April pay hike announcement, on March 16, alleging  burdensome, harsh and wrongful  actions. So while Dan Price has suggested that the lawsuit is the result of the pay hike—Lucas Price stands to earn less because more profits are going toward salaries—it may actually have been a brilliant marketing move to make Dan Price out to be the good guy and thus help his chances of beating the lawsuit. The suit also asks that Dan Price buy out Lucas' shares, but with less profit, that's tougher to do. Oh, and Dan Price told Weise that he was served two weeks after he made the announcement. Dan Price's response to her questions about the inconsistency between court records and his version of the timing?  I am only aware of the suit being initiated after the raise.  (He repeated this four times.) He has, however, denied allegations about to be made public by his former wife through TEDx that he beat and even waterboarded her during their marriage. In a statement to the Guardian, the company said Weise put forth  reckless accusations and baseless speculations that are unequivocally false.",CEO Upped Salaries to $70K. But Were His Reasons Pure?

Perhaps even more remarkable, though: The skipper was aboard the same vessel that set the previous record.  It was an amazing coincidence,  says Andrew Leaper, who is friends with the man who held the prior record of about 93 years. The friend is  very unhappy that I have topped his record,  Leaper says.  He never stopped talking about it.  So what was in the bottle? Nothing particularly romantic: It held a 1914 postcard from a Glasgow boat captain, who sent 1,890 more like it; of those, 315 have been found. The dispersed bottles were made to sink in order to investigate Scottish currents. The postcard offers a reward of six pence to the finder.

Something very strange has happened and I want to know what,  says Annette Edwards.  I've sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before.

"(Jun 19, 2017  6:04 PM CDT) A homeowner outside Pittsburgh, Penn., has a rather jolting daily reminder of a construction mistake he made nearly 13 years ago. CBS Pittsburgh reports that Jerry Lynn of Ross Township accidentally dropped an alarm clock between the walls during a home improvement project in the fall of 2004. Though it’s been 13 years, the clock beeps every evening at 6:50pm (unless it's daylight saving time, when the beeping starts an hour later). Back in 2004, Lynn set the alarm for 10 minutes later, then lowered the clock through a second-floor vent via a string. The plan was for the alarm to go off, once lowered to the first floor, as a signal for where Lynn needed to drill a hole through his living room wall for a TV hookup. Instead, the clock detached from the string, leaving Ross unable to lift it back through the vent.  As I was laying it down, all of a sudden I heard it go ‘thunk’ as it came loose,  he says, adding that he figured  maybe three, four months, it’ll run out of battery.  But the clock has been ticking faithfully since, with a distinctive beep that can be heard in CBS Pittsburgh's video around the :25 second mark. Though the Lynn family has grown accustomed to the daily alarm, Jerry’s wife Sylvia told CBS Pittsburgh that it still throws off guests.

The inventor of the plastic chalice known as the Red Solo Cup, who lived in both Illinois and Arizona, died on Dec. 21 at age 84, reports People. A death notice describes the devoted family man and father of 10 as a philanthropist,  an innovator, a hands-on manufacturing expert, and an industry pioneer.  After starting at his father's Solo Cup Company at 18, Hulseman worked his way up and is credited with inventing the famous party cup at some point in the 1970s. He also developed the Traveler Lid, which has been featured at the Museum of Modern Art, notes the Miami Herald. Hulseman—who eventually rose to the position of CEO—is  owed a debt of thanks by virtually every American (and quite a few imbibers overseas) for his now-ubiquitous invention,  the Red Solo Cup, with rings marking 1.5 ounces for liquor, 5 ounces for wine, and 12 ounces for beer, observes People.

"(May 5, 2016  6:03 AM CDT) It's a milestone that's at once being called groundbreaking and a Pandora's box: Scientists at Cambridge University surprised even themselves by growing embryos for 13 days outside the womb—one day short of a longstanding legal limit that's never been pushed up against because embryos failed to survive that long. The researchers did it with only a thick blend of nutrients that mimic the womb, they report in the journal Nature Cell Biology. Because rudimentary cell development takes place at the 14-day mark, more than a dozen countries including the US and UK restrict embryo research after that point. As Nature puts it:  After this time, the logic goes, a unique individual comes into being.  Given how difficult it is to observe this early but critical formation of life in the mother, scientists are largely in the dark about just what sort of cellular and molecular activity is taking place, reports the Telegraph.  It is a most enigmatic and mysterious period of our development which we have never had any access to,  says the lead author. The vast majority of pregnancies that fail are the result of improper implantation, so learning exactly what happens in this stage is critical to improving viability. Implantation is also when  many developmental defects can become acquired,  she continues,  but until now, it has been impossible to study this in human embryos.   It's a big deal,  reports Vice's Motherboard, which notes that by being able to observe how embryos change around day 14,  when the embryo becomes a self-organizing ball of cells destined to become a baby,  we could better understand not just development but fertility and disabilities. But critics worry about testing embryos beyond 14 days.  Pro-life means you protect human life,  one ethicist tells the Telegraph.  There’s no protection being in a petri dish being experimented on.

The two boys, both aged 16, were stopped Wednesday by police who believed arson was behind the blaze in Carro, north of Nice, where 370 acres of vegetation were burnt, says a police official in Aix-en-Provence, per the AP.

Actor Jack Lemmon once described Gelbart  as one of the greatest writers of comedy to have graced the arts in this century.  Gelbart began writing for radio at age 16, then moved on to television, Broadway and the silver screen. He was twice nominated for Oscars, for best screenplay for 1977’s Oh, God! and for screenwriting for 1982’s Tootsie. But MASH, which debuted on CBS in 1972, was his crowning achievement, one on which his influence was  seminal, basic and enormous,  a former colleague says.","Larry Gelbart, Writer on MASH, Tootsie, Dies at 81"
"(Apr 2, 2014  8:56 AM CDT) It's not your everyday court decision: An Italian couple has been awarded $28,000 in relation to their bad sex life. But the case isn't quite as crazy as that might seem. Some two years ago, the female half of the couple was hit by a car while crossing the street; the injuries she sustained initially left her bedridden for three months, reports Italy's La Nazione, and have permanently damaged their ability to have a sex life on par with what they previously enjoyed. And there are also other limitations for the two, who say they can't ride bikes or travel together. The Local shares the rather creative line of defense offered by the driver's insurance company: that as a middle-aged couple, they wouldn't be having an active sex life anyway.  You cannot consider age in the couple’s relationship—whether in sexual, social, or leisure terms,  said the Tuscan judge per La Nazione, which reports the husband now has to handle all the cooking, cleaning, and chores.

Per NBC 4, participants will march more than 100 miles over the 10 days, logging roughly 17 miles per day, and stay in churches along the planned route.  We know that this is a very dangerous moment in our nation’s history, a moment that requires action,  march organizers said via a press release, referencing the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville this August.  We are marching to DC in the spirit of love, equality and justice like those before us did in the face of hatred and oppression.  Coordinated by a number of activist groups,  The March to Confront White Supremacy  organizers include the Women’s March, Working Families Party, AFL-CIO, and Color of Change. Per the press release, the march’s demands include Trump stepping down from office unless he takes action against the white supremacist movement:  We will demand our country reckon with its long history of white supremacy, that our nation’s leadership side with those of us who will no longer abide it, and we call for the removal of all those, including the president, who refuse to do so.  According to the march’s website, peaceful demonstrations, described as  wave after wave of nonviolent civil disobedience,  will begin when participants arrive in DC on September 6.

Looking down at your phone can put a strain on your neck equivalent to the weight of 60 pounds, a study finds. To put that in perspective, 60 pounds is the weight of an 8-year-old or four bowling balls, the Atlantic reports. That's if you're leaning forward at a 60-degree angle; at 45 degrees, it's 49 pounds, while at 30 degrees, it's 40 pounds. Even at a 15-degree angle, you might as well be carrying 27 pounds of weight. That's because a human head weighs 10 to 12 pounds, and tilting it forward increases gravity's pull on it. All that tilting is, unsurprisingly, not good for your spine, researchers say after making their findings using a computer model of a spine.  These [cervical spine] stresses,  they write,  may lead to early wear, tear, degeneration, and possibly surgeries.  Their advice, per CBS News:  While it is nearly impossible to avoid the technologies that cause these issues, individuals should make an effort to look at their phones with a neutral spine and to avoid spending hours each day hunched over.

"(May 4, 2019  8:00 AM CDT) Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired at least 90 rockets into southern Israel on Saturday, per the Israeli military, triggering retaliatory airstrikes and tank fire against militant targets in the blockaded enclave and shattering a monthlong lull in violence. Gaza's Health Ministry said a 22-year-old Palestinian, Emad Nassir, was killed by an Israeli airstrike. Six other Palestinians sustained injuries from airstrikes and shelling. In Israel, there were no reports of injuries; police said a house in the coastal city of Ashkelon was damaged, per the AP. The sudden outbreak of fighting came as leaders from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, and the smaller armed faction Islamic Jihad were in Egypt for talks with mediators aimed at restoring a fraying ceasefire. Hamas leaders have hoped the recent calm would pave the way for a deeper, longer-term ceasefire understanding. The Israeli military said dozens of rockets were intercepted by its Iron Dome rocket-defense system, and that roads near the Gaza border were closed to civilian traffic. The army said its chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, convened an emergency session with top security officials. The European Union's ambassador to Israel, Emanuele Giaufret, sharply criticized the rocket attacks on Twitter, saying  firing indiscriminately against civilians [is] unacceptable.  Tensions have been rising in recent days amid allegations from Hamas that Israel has been delaying implementation of last month's ceasefire understandings. On Friday, two Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces during the weekly protests along the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence. Palestinian militants also shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers along the border fence; no group claimed responsibility for the shooting. In response, Israeli aircraft carried out retaliatory strikes, killing two Hamas militants.","For a Month, a Lull. Then Came the 90 Rockets"
"(Aug 29, 2011  3:45 AM CDT) The Pentagon has racked up a few late fees for metal containers it has rented and failed to return on time. Nothing serious—just a little more than $720 million during the past 10 years. Used for storage, building material, and shelter in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 20-foot containers can generate more than $2,200 each in late fees.  These are the kinds of things that happen when people are asleep at the wheel,  a defense analyst tells USA Today. Why the tardy returns? Because officials thought these wars would end sooner, says defense policy analyst John Pike. Late fees for the containers cost the Pentagon $128 million in 2004, then dropped to $17 million four years later, and rebounded to $30 million last year due to the surge in Afghanistan. Under budgetary pressure, the Pentagon has at least made deals for lower late fees. But  this is real money,  says Pike.

That's because the city's government unanimously voted to change the city's name six days a year to mark milestones in the country's victory in World War II. Tomorrow is the 70th anniversary of the 1943 defeat of the Nazis in the city, which will officially be called the  hero-city Stalingrad.  Sergei Zabednov, the lawmaker behind the measure, reveals a quirky way in which the name will surface tomorrow: Weathermen will be able to use it in their evening broadcasts. The New York Times notes that a certain nostalgia for Stalin and the Soviet Union seems to be taking hold across the country. Last year, just 22% of Russians saw Stalin as having a  negative role  in Russian history, compared to 60% in 1998. Still, many in Volgograd aren't too keen on the change. But Zabednov isn't buying it.  They say: 'How can you talk about Stalin? He was a despot.' Excuse me, but Peter the First was also a despot, just as bad as Stalin, but the name Petersburg has been preserved. Now, Stalingrad has been preserved as the symbol of victory.

Officials at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha have said Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, will begin treatment in the hospital's 10-bed special isolation unit, the largest of four such units in the US.

That misconception persists no longer. As NBC 7 reports, David was abducted as a child by his father, who took him to Mexico where he was raised by his grandparents. David, who speaks no English, knew all his life he was born in America, but wasn't aware of the truth of how he came to leave the country. As Kathy explains to WEAU,  One day my ex-husband came to my sister, she was watching him, and picked him up and never returned him. When I didn't hear from him I knew he took him to Mexico.  That truth surfaced after David tried to cross into the US on October 30. He had no papers and was detained in San Diego for two days, all the while insisting he was an American—which his birth certificate, issued in Chicago in 1976, ultimately proved. That led to a phone call to Kathy, who was told that someone named David Amaya—who she was told decades ago she couldn't report missing since he was in Mexico—had been stopped by Border Patrol. Soon after, she confirmed it was her son. A San Diego ministry is raising money to facilitate a trip for David to Chippewa Falls, Wis., to see his mother, hopefully by Thanksgiving.

"(May 2, 2015  7:04 AM CDT) A state of emergency was declared yesterday by Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad with nearly 17 million chickens and turkeys dead, dying, or scheduled to be euthanized due to a widening bird flu outbreak. The proclamation activates disaster response and recovery procedures for the state's homeland security and emergency management personnel. It authorizes use of state resources, supplies, equipment, and materials to track and monitor bird flu, establish restrictions around affected farms, and assist in the rapid detection of cases. It also allows state agencies to help in the disposal of poultry carcasses, an increasing problem in a state where about 27% of its 60 million egg-laying chickens will be wiped out. Reuters reported last week that this could be the worst bird flu outbreak in US history.  This is a magnitude much greater than anything we've dealt with in recent modern times,  Branstad said. Added Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey,  Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone to slow the spread of the disease, outbreaks are continuing to appear.  Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer, providing one of every five eggs consumed in the country. The state is ninth in turkey production and has lost well over 110,000 turkeys. The state now has 21 cases of the H5N2 virus in 10 counties. Overall, the outbreak has led to Midwest chicken and turkey producers losing more than 21 million birds.

"(Aug 9, 2013  6:54 PM CDT) A published report says federal authorities plan to arrest two former JPMorgan Chase & Co. employees on suspicion that they tried to conceal the size of the investment bank's $6 billion trading loss last year. The New York Times reported today that the arrests of Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout are expected to occur in London in coming days, citing unnamed persons briefed on the matter. Martin-Artajo oversaw JPMorgan's trading strategy in London, while Grout recorded the value of the soured investment The $6 billion loss hinged on large wagers made by the traders and was first blamed on JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil, known as  the London Whale.  Some investigators now believe Iksil was blamed unfairly, and Iksil has struck a cooperation agreement with the government. But it's not clear whether he could still face other charges. As for Martin-Artaio and Grout, a federal grand jury voted to indict both on criminal fraud charges.

"(Apr 10, 2015  3:25 PM CDT) That extra glass of wine you're downing every night after you've put in a 10-hour workday could be because … of that 10-hour workday. A review of 61 studies across 14 countries (for a total of more than 330,000 subjects) linked working more than 48 hours a week with  risky  alcohol use, Harvard Business Review reports. Marianna Virtanen and fellow researchers at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health found when subjects worked those longer hours, they were 11% more likely to be heavy drinkers than those who punched in for no more than the typical 40-hour workweek, New Scientist reports. For the purposes of this study, Virtanen defined  risky  drinking as more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week for women, more than 21 for men—a definition that Sarah Green writes for HBR is  rather generous.  After all, the CDC defines heavy drinking as more than eight drinks a week for women, 15 drinks if you're a guy. Virtanen warns the study is  observational  and more studies are needed, but her team did find this when it looked at workers who put in long hours but had normal drinking habits: Over a six-year period, 12% of them evolved into heavy drinkers. The study was published in the BMJ in January, and in emails with Virtanen, Green says she tried to find a  loophole.  For instance, is there a difference between working in an office or from home? Does the extra time you spend emailing in the evenings count? Virtanen answered her with more questions, like,  What if you enjoy your work and it’s highly rewarding? We hope we will get answers to these questions in our future studies.  (Here's how much America's heaviest drinkers drink.)",10-Hour Workdays Tied to 'Risky' Drinking
"(Nov 9, 2017  1:03 PM) The latest high-profile figure accused of sexual misconduct is a politician who has staked his career on morality. The Washington Post is out with a detailed report about Alabama's Roy Moore, the state's former supreme court justice who is now running for the US Senate. A woman who is now 53 says Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was just 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Leigh Corfman says that they did not have intercourse, but that Moore drove her to his home, stripped down to his underwear, removed her pants and shirt, and touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that when he began guiding her hand toward his underwear, she recoiled, got dressed, and asked to leave, at which point he drove her home. Moore categorically denies the allegations as  fake news  drummed up by Democrats. The Post also talks to three other women who say that Moore asked them out on dates, sometimes successfully, when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s and still single. The account given by Corfman is the only one that advances beyond kissing.  I wasn’t ready for that,  Corfman says of Moore's attempt to guide her hand.  I had never put my hand on a man’s penis, much less an erect one.  She says she first met Moore outside a courtroom, when he approached her and her mother and offered to sit with Corfman while her mom went inside for a custody hearing. In his later career, Moore would twice be removed from his chief justice post for taking stands against gay marriage and his refusal to remove a 10 Commandments plaque.

"(Sep 21, 2020  3:37 PM CDT) Electric and hydrogen-powered truck startup Nikola secured a $2 billion partnership with General Motors earlier this month—and lost its founder two weeks later amid swirling accusations about an  intricate fraud  allegedly carried out by the company. Trevor Milton, who also served as the executive chair, stepped down Monday while promising to defend himself against the  false allegations,  reports NBC News.  Nikola is truly in my blood and always will be, and the focus should be on the company and its world-changing mission, not me,  he said in a statement. Things turned for the company by way of a Sept. 10 report from short-seller Hindenburg Research that alleged the company was bolstered by  an ocean of lies,  including that it captured video of a truck rolling down a hill but presented it as if it was driving on a highway and painted the words  hydrogen electric  onto a vehicle that uses natural gas. Nikola suggested the  ocean of lies  is more applicable to the Hindenburg report, which the AP reports it described in a statement as  replete with misleading information and salacious accusations directed at our founder and chairman.  Nikola says it has lawyered up and is looking at possible actions, and stated that the video did not describe the truck as moving under its own propulsion. GM plans to close the deal, with GM CEO Mary Barra last week stating that a  very, very capable team has done the appropriate diligence  on it. Under the deal, GM will engineer and build Nikola's Badger hydrogen fuel cell and electric pickup truck.

"(Sep 27, 2011  6:14 PM CDT) This might be the end of the road for fugitive George Wright, but what a road it's been. Authorities arrested the 68-year-old in Portugal yesterday after 41 years on the lam. Even the bare bones of his rap sheet nearly defy belief, as CNN and AP recount: In 1962, he murdered a gas station owner (a highly decorated WWII vet) during a robbery; he escaped from prison in 1970 (reportedly by stealing the warden's car), then went underground with the Black Liberation Army. In 1972, while dressed as a priest, he and others hijacked a plane to Algiers (after making FBI agents dress in bathing suits to deliver ransom money). Algeria returned the plane and money but allowed the hijackers to disappear, which they did with help from Black Panther activist Eldridge Cleaver, who was living in the country. Wright remained on the loose for four decades until a dogged New Jersey corrections officer got a lead (possibly because Wright contacted relatives in the US) that resulted in his arrest. Wright is fighting extradition back to the US.

Prosecutors have agreed to free Derek Harris, a military veteran who was arrested in 2008 for selling an officer less than $30 of marijuana. In a Louisiana Supreme Court hearing last month, Harris argued that his legal team fumbled the case by not challenging his sentence. Seems his original lawyer had failed to tell the judge, Durwood Conque, that he was obligated to hand down a shorter sentence if the mandatory minimum  shocks the conscience,  per the Times-Picayune. But at the time, Conque said he felt compelled to sentence Harris to life under the state's habitual offender rule—which took into account the man's prior convictions of drug-dealing, distribution, robbery, and burglary.  His prior offenses were nonviolent and related to his untreated dependency on drugs,  Louisiana Supreme Court Justice John Weimer wrote in his opinion to free Harris, adding that he was  not a drug kingpin.

Airbus Chief Executive and President Fabrice Bregier and Japan Airlines President Yoshiharu Ueki signed the deal today in Tokyo, which includes an option for JAL to buy 25 more Airbus planes.

Ramis was probably best known for his aforementioned role in Ghostbusters, which he also co-wrote, but his fingerprints are all over a host of other beloved comedies; he directed Caddyshack and Groundhog Day, co-wrote Animal House, and starred in Stripes, among others, according to IMDB. Ramis had been sick since 2010 with autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis, a rare disease that causes blood vessels to swell and forced Ramis to re-learn how to walk.  He was the person that I wanted to be when I was growing up,  says Judd Apatow, who cast Ramis as Seth Rogen's dad in Knocked Up.  His work is the reason why so many of us got into comedy.",Ghostbusters Star Harold Ramis Dead at 69

By the time police got there, more than 700 guests were in attendance, with more continuing to arrive, NJ.com reports. The home's owner plus two 20-something women, who allegedly rented the 3,700-square-foot Jackson Township mansion on Airbnb and organized the party, were all issued summonses for violating the governor's executive order, which limits outdoor gatherings to 500 people and indoor gatherings to 100 or 25% of a room's capacity, whichever is lower. Elsewhere in the county last Monday, a party with more than 400 guests was broken up. A state police spokesperson suggested the state's restrictions could be driving the situation.  I do think the fact that bars and restaurants are closed then create this underground situation which is certainly not one we want because ... young people, even if asymptomatic and you’re positive, the fact that you can transmit that to your family members is certainly one that concerns us,  he said.

"(Dec 22, 2020  3:40 AM) Michaela Garecht's disappearance made headlines across the nation after the 9-year-old disappeared from a supermarket in California's Bay Area in 1988. Her body has never been found, but more than three decades later, a man has been charged with her kidnapping and murder, NBC News reports. David Misch, 59, is accused of moving a child's scooter nearer to his car in a grocery store parking lot in Hayward. The scooter belonged to Michaela, who had ridden with a friend to the market to get snacks one November morning, leaving their scooters outside. Misch is accused of snatching Michaela as she approached his car to retrieve her scooter. Misch is currently imprisoned for the 1989 murder of a woman in the Hayward area, and he also faces charges of murdering two women in nearby Fremont in 1986.  The crime shocked not only the local community of Hayward and Alameda County, but the entire Bay Area and the nation,  the district attorney says of Michaela's murder.  It was so brazen, so ruthless but clearly planned.  The police chief read a statement from Michaela's mom, who says that while she is  glad that there are answers,  she is also devastated, KRON4 reports.  In the last year I had to come to a place of accepting that Michaela was no longer alive. But somehow that acceptance was far more wrapped up in the idea of Michaela sitting on a fluffy, pink cloud, walking streets of gold, dancing on grassy hills, soaring among the stars,  she says.

The government said last year that more than 20 states were targeted by hackers believed to be Russian agents before the 2016 elections. But for many states, the calls Friday from the Department of Homeland Security were the first official confirmation of whether their states were on the list. States that said they were targeted include Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in three states said the attempts could be linked to Russia. The Wisconsin Election Commission, for example, said the state's systems were targeted by  Russian government cyber actors.  Federal officials said that in most of the 21 states, the targeting was preparatory activity such as scanning computer systems. The targets included voter registration systems but not vote tallying software. Officials said there were some attempts to compromise networks but most were unsuccessful.

The missing included a 7-year-old boy and another child believed to be around the same age, as well as a man, the AP reports. Migrants often try to cross the river, mostly in poorly constructed rafts with no safety gear, and the water can be deceptively high and fast-moving. According to one official, Border Patrol agents encountered a man at about 9:45pm Wednesday evening near Del Rio, Texas. He told them a raft carrying nine people had overturned and his baby son and nephew had been swept away along the other child and man. The agents heard the man's wife and an older son screaming in the darkness and the two were pulled from the muddy water alive, according to a preliminary report of the incident from the official. Another man and his 13-year-old child were rescued nearby, the official said. The children were hospitalized for observation.

The study is the first national estimate based on a new term,  alcohol use disorder,  in a widely used psychiatric handbook (DSM-5) that was updated in 2013. Researchers from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism asked 36,000 adults during 2012 or 2013 about lifetime drinking habits, including current or within the past year. About 14% of adults were current or recent problem drinkers, or nearly 33 million nationally, and 30%—almost 69 million—had been at some point in their lives. Drinking problems were most prevalent among men, whites, and Native Americans. Low-income adults, those younger than 30, and those who never married also relatively high rates. Problem drinking also was more common among city dwellers than those in rural areas, while the West and Midwest had higher rates than other regions. The new handbook defines problem drinkers or those with the disorder as people with at least two of 11 symptoms, including drinking that harms performance at work, school, or home; frequent hangovers; and failed attempts to limit drinking.

This week, Snohomish County police announced the arrest of William Earl Talbott, 55, in the 1987 murders of Canadians Jay Cook, 20, and Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18. The Washington investigators used a process similar to the one used to crack the notorious Golden State killer case, uploading DNA taken from the crime scene to GEDmatch, a public genealogy site. The suspect’s DNA profile led them to family members of the suspect who had shared their DNA information on the site. Based on the suspect’s DNA profile, a genetic genealogist was able to create an extensive family tree using information from the site, as well as other publicly available and social media sites. Once the detectives had their suspect, they still needed to get an exact match to his DNA, so they followed him and eventually collected a cup he had used. GEDmatch users have mixed feelings about investigators mining the site for clues. Some view it as a violation of privacy.  This is really tough,  an ethicist told the Times about the Golden State Killer case.  He was a horrible man and it is good that he was identified, but does the end justify the means?

"(Aug 8, 2013  7:30 AM CDT) Now that the Supreme Court has overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, the Pentagon is reviewing a plan that would extend full marriage benefits to same-sex couples by the end of this month, according to a draft memo from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlining the proposal obtained yesterday by the AP. In the process, the Defense Department would ditch a previous plan that would have allowed unmarried same-sex couples access to some limited benefits after signing a declaration form. Now, troops will actually need to be legally married to get the benefits, but the military will give them 10 days of leave so they can travel to a state where gay marriage is legal and tie the knot. In the memo, Hagel says that the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that  the spousal and family benefits far outweigh the benefits that could be extended under a declaration system.  A source tells the AP the Justice Department is reviewing the memo, and that the Pentagon can take action once that is complete.",Memo: Gay Troops to Get 10 Days of Leave to Marry

The $10 million figure for Jamel McNair, 26, and Denita McNair, 19, was disclosed in documents filed in Surrogate's Court in New York's Westchester County, where James McNair lived until the June 7 accident. A Walmart truck hit a limo van that was carrying him, Morgan, and others home from a show in Delaware. Morgan, a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, is still recuperating from a brain injury. His attorney, Benedict Morelli, said yesterday that Morgan is not fully recovered but is  working very hard to get better, physically, emotionally and mentally.  Morgan had hoped to attend the 40th anniversary show of SNL last month, Morelli said, but was not well enough. Morgan still hasn't seen a segment in which Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin paid tribute to him during the show.  I think it's going to take him a while before he's emotionally and mentally ready to watch that,  the attorney said.  He knows about it. He said to me, 'I couldn't watch it, but one day I will.'

Sadie Hill and her daughter, Adalee, found the wallet earlier this week in a parking lot. Hill said she works two jobs to make ends meet and could have used the money, but knew the right thing to do.  The only option was to return it,  she said.  But, I called my mom and I said, 'You know, God is really testing me today.'  Hill and her daughter found identification in the wallet and drove to J. Pat Wigginton's home to return it. He gave them a $20 reward but later wished he'd done more.  Such appreciation for their honesty, and I didn't get their name,  he said.

The case went cold until earlier this year, when a former carnival worker, Lloyd Lee Welch, was named a person of interest in their 1975 disappearance—and now police are searching a Virginia property once owned by Welch's aunt and uncle in the hopes of finding clues about the girls, who were never found, My Fox DC reports. Welch  has criminal convictions involving young female victims in the states of Virginia, Delaware, and South Carolina,  according to the Montgomery County police chief, and detectives have been tracking his movements before he was imprisoned in 1997. A resident of Thaxton, Va., where police are currently searching, tells My Fox DC her father recalls Welch and  thought maybe he wasn't right in the head.

When the Virginia governor's questionable financial relationship with a dietary supplement company was exposed by the Washington Post last month, McDonnell claimed that the $15,000 paid by Star Scientific for the catering at his daughter's wedding was a  gift  directly to the happy couple and not a political donation. But the Post has now obtained documents proving he was directly financially responsible for the wedding—and that the $3,500 left over from the catering costs went back to his wife. Star Scientific is one of McDonnell's big campaign contributors. Under Virginia law, he must disclose any gift over $50.

The officers had been at an earlier rally in support of Black and Indigenous people  providing security and protecting [the protesters'] First Amendment right to peaceful assembly,  per a Chicago Police Department statement cited by CNN. The Chicago Tribune lays out the timeline, which started around 4:20pm with the rally. Demonstrators then started marching down Columbus Drive around 7pm when word got out that the Columbus statue in Grant Park was being protected by police. That's when members of the group rushed the short stone wall that encircled the statue, hurling frozen bottles, rocks, and other objects at the officers, the department's statement notes. CBS Chicago video shows fireworks being set off around the statue, while another clip from a Tribune reporter shows a man yelling,  This is not the way!  as protesters clash with police. Officers were pushed back, and one protester scaled the statue, which ABC7 notes was covered in plastic, and threw a rope around it. The crowd tried for about 30 minutes to pull the statue down, to no avail, but they did manage to cover it and the wall with graffiti. Police reinforcements arrived by 7:40pm, using tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd.

Despite the worries of critics that it will add to the nation's opioid problem, the painkiller from AcelRx won FDA approval on Friday, per the AP. The big selling point of Dsuvia—which contains the painkiller sufentanil—is that it can be given to patients easily in place of an IV. The Pentagon, in particular, likes that option for soldiers on the battlefield. In a statement, the FDA promises  very tight restrictions  on the drug, but that's not appeasing critics.  It is certain that Dsuvia will worsen the opioid epidemic and kill people needlessly,  says Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the nonprofit Public Citizen's Health Research Group, per ABC News.

"(Aug 23, 2011  4:24 AM CDT) Minnesota man Howard Snitzer survived for an incredible 96 minutes without a pulse thanks to a device called a capnograph—and the determination of two dozen first responders. The device, which measures how much carbon dioxide is expelled with each breath, lets doctors know how much blood is being carried to vital organs. It was carried by a nurse who treated the 54-year-old after he collapsed from a heart attack. Responders, encouraged by signals that their efforts were working, took turns to continue CPR on Snitzer long after emergency room doctors told them he was dead. He survived without brain damage.  The lesson that I certainly learned from this is you don't quit—you keep trying as long as you have objective, measurable evidence that the patient's brain is being protected by adequate blood flow as determined by the capnographic data,  the anesthesiologist who managed to get Snitzer's heart beating normally again tells NPR.

"(Jun 21, 2017  12:24 AM CDT) The severity of America's opioid epidemic was captured in a dire government report published Tuesday. According to the report, released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the rate of opioid-related emergency room visits nearly doubled between 2005 and 2014, increasing a whopping 99%. The report also found the rate of opioid-related inpatient hospital stays increased 64% during that time. All told, American hospitals reported 1.27 million opioid-related visits in 2014, about 3,500 per day. The report also states that women have closed the gender gap when it comes to opioid-related hospital visits. In 2005 the rate of male inpatient stays was considerably higher than the rate for women, but by 2014 the rate was the same, though men are still more likely to be treated in hospital emergency departments for opioid-related issues. Though the opioid epidemic is a countrywide problem, the AHRQ report finds that the problem is considerably worse in certain states. Maryland ranked at the top of the list of states for emergency visits in 2014, while Massachusetts saw the most inpatient stays. The Washington Post reports that Maryland is already suffering high rates of heroin and prescription-opioid overdoses. The number of opioid-related deaths in the state has nearly quadrupled since 2010 and the governor declared a state of emergency earlier this year. That increase can be blamed partially on the spread of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. One expert tells the Huffington Post the AHRQ data comes as  no surprise,  noting that overdose deaths are  just the tip of the iceberg  in the US.

Bodies lay everywhere in Port-au-Prince, as survivors, many severely injured, set up camps, salvaging mattresses, plastic chairs, bits of cardboard and food from the rubble. Others streamed on foot into the Haitian countryside, where wooden and cinderblock shacks showed little sign of damage, passing ambulances and UN trucks racing in the opposite direction.

"(Jul 24, 2008  9:08 AM CDT) Ford Motor Co. lost $8.67 billion in the second quarter and will retool two more North American truck and SUV plants to build small, fuel-efficient vehicles, the company announced today. The net loss includes $8.03 billion in writedowns due to a decline in the value of its truck and SUV inventory, as well as Ford Motor Credit Co.'s truck-heavy lease portfolio. Even excluding those items, Ford lost 62 cents per share, more than double what Wall Street expected. Include the writedowns, and Ford lost $3.88 per share. Ford also announced that it will bring six European small car models to North America by the end of 2012, and the next-generation Ford Explorer, which comes out in 2010, will be built on car underpinnings, making it more fuel efficient than the current truck-based model.","Ford Posts $8.7B Loss, Will Make Fewer Trucks"
"(Jan 20, 2011  5:48 AM) More than 230 mayors are meeting in Washington this week and they plan to sign a  civility accord  thought up by Tucson's mayor after the shootings in his city. Mayor Robert Walkup aims to have mayors take the lead in restoring civility to politics. His accord urges mayors to  strive to understand differing perspectives,  to  respect the right of all Americans to hold different opinions,  and to  choose words carefully.  Analysts say the move toward civility is more likely to gain more traction at the local level than in Congress.  Most mayors have to deal with rather practical issues—garbage removal, snow removal—and it’s not the stuff that makes for great traumatic rhetoric,  a Princeton professor of history and public affairs tells the Christian Science Monitor.  Republican mayors can’t always be staunch conservatives, because they have to deal with Democrats to get stuff done.",230 Mayors to Sign Tucson 'Civility Pact'
"(Nov 25, 2010  2:09 PM) To add to the list of  Brazilian Fritzl ,  Colombian Frizl , and  Aussie Fritzl : an Argentine Fritzl. The Telegraph reports on the case, revealed yesterday, of a 62-year-old man accused of fathering 10 kids with his own daughter. Judge Virgilio Palud spoke with local radio about the man, who was arrested in June for alleged cattle rustling—which prompted his 43-year-old daughter to tell police of the alleged abuse. She says she has been beaten and raped since age 13 at her home 375 miles north of Buenos Aires. Judge Palud says the woman claims she had 10 children by her father—one of whom died—who are now ages 7 to 27; the eldest apparently knows that his grandfather is also his father. He adds that another daughter of the suspect says she was also raped repeatedly, but fled the family home after having an abortion. The father has been charged with repeated sexual abuse and incest.",'Argentine Fritzl' Had 10 Kids With Daughter: Judge
"(Jun 18, 2017  11:00 AM CDT) Three people have been charged with killing two Maryland teens who were found dead the night before their high school graduation, and police said they believe the slayings were revenge for a robbery that one of the teens was rumored to have committed. The three are charged in the deaths of 17-year-old Shadi Adi Najjar and 18-year-old Artem Ziberov, said Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger. The suspects were identified as 25-year-old Jose Canales-Yanez, 19-year-old Roger Garcia, and 24-year-old Edgar Garcia-Gaona. Manger said each is being charged with two counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He said Garcia and Garcia-Gaona are brothers. Manger said investigators learned from friends of Najjar that he was rumored to have robbed Canales-Yanez's girlfriend last December, and was killed in retaliation. He added that,  we're unsure right now if there was a motive to kill Ziberov as well, or if he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Najjar and Ziberov were found shot to death in a blue Honda Civic in Montgomery Village, the night before they were supposed to graduate from Northwest High School. Manger said that just before Najjar died, he texted someone saying he was going to sell a graduation ticket to Roger Garcia, who was identified as a Northwest High School student.  We're certainly working on the strong possibility that this was a ruse to get the two victims to that location,  Manger said.",Cops: Fatal Ambush of 2 Teens Was a Revenge Killing

Republicans intend to try then to force the president to roll back a new immigration policy that removes the threat of deportation from millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.

"(Aug 19, 2011  5:00 AM CDT) A coordinated attack today on a British compound in Kabul involving two suicide bombers and a five-hour long firefight between Afghan security troops and attackers who penetrated the complex killed at least 10 people, Afghan officials say. The attack on the British Council occurred as Afghans celebrated Independence Day, marking the day the country achieved full independence from Britain in 1919. A spokesman for the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The dead included eight Afghan policemen, a security guard whose nationality was not immediately known, and an Afghan municipal worker, according to a Kabul police official. Two of four people wounded in the blasts were not Afghans. The police official says he counted five suicide bombers. One detonated an explosives-laden car outside the compound, one set off an explosion inside, while at least three more got inside the compound on foot.",10 Dead in Attack on British Council in Kabul
"(Jul 11, 2015  12:43 PM CDT) Cell phones in theaters: After two high-profile incidents on Broadway, things seem to have reached a  tipping point,  observes Variety. The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone.  I saw the outlet and ran for it,  he recalls.  That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.  Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized.  I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,  he said, per Gothamist. (Variety notes that Hand to God, which has been struggling to sell tickets, was happy to capitalize by organizing that press conference.) The second incident occurred when Patti LuPone took the phone from an audience member who was texting during Show for Days. Given that she remained in character the whole time, the New York Post grants her a  standing ovation.  Vanity Fair rounds up previous incidents, saying they  offer proof that, even if our movie theaters are slowly succumbing to the inevitability of omnipresent cell phones, the theater community may well choose to die on this hill.  Plus, Broadway actors have a big advantage over movie actors:  the ability to fight back.",2 Crazy Incidents Illustrate Broadway Menace: Phones

It's not clear what type of drug was involved, and while autopsy results are still pending, there is suspicion the pair died from overdoses, reports the New York Daily News. Both men were security contractors on the Maersk Alabama container ship, which was portrayed in the move Captain Phillips. The chief of the maritime security firm Trident Group says there  is no immediate indication as to the cause of death, but the deaths were not caused by operational activity  and the men's next of kin have asked for no further information to be released, the AP reports.

"(Jan 7, 2014  7:52 AM) The inner details of a March 8, 1971, hit on the FBI office in Media, Pa., are finally coming to light—from the mouths of those who wielded the crowbars. An eight-person antiwar group (made up in part of professors, a day-care director, and a 20-year-old self-taught lock picker) descended on the office while the rest of the country watched Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier go 15 rounds, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. The New York Times reports they spent months casing the building, with one member posing as a college student inquiring about job options to gain access and determine there was no alarm system. They picked a lock, used a crowbar to break another, stuffed suitcases with as many as 1,000 documents, and fled in getaway cars, later meeting at a farmhouse to review their haul—which included files they mailed to reporters, files that shook the FBI  to its core,  per the Inquirer. One memo advised agents to question activists in  New Left  groups on campuses to  get the point across there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox ; another urged the infiltration of African-American groups. But the break-in most notably led to the first publicized reference to COINTELPRO, a surveillance program started under J. Edgar Hoover in 1956 with the goal of ruining the lives of perceived enemies—like Martin Luther King, Jr., who was sent an anonymous letter written by FBI agents that told him to kill himself or see his affairs publicized. (It also targeted perceived Communists and the KKK before being shuttered in 1972 after the break-in threw light on it, reports NBC News.)  The FBI was never the same,  says Betty Medsger, a reporter who received some documents and has a book coming out on the subject this week. With the statute of limitations having expired decades ago, five members of the group decided to speak at her urging. A wild side note: About 200 FBI agents investigated the crime for more than five years, and closed the case with no answers; Medsger says only one of the eight made it onto the final suspects lists.",Burglars Who Hit FBI in 1971 Finally Come Forward
"(Jul 13, 2020  12:07 AM CDT) A US district judge on Monday ordered a new delay in federal executions, hours before the first lethal injection was scheduled to be carried out at a federal prison in Indiana, per the AP. The administration is certain to ask a higher court to allow the executions to move forward. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are still legal issues to resolve and that  the public is not served by short-circuiting legitimate judicial process.  The executions, pushed by the Trump administration, would be the first carried out at the federal level since 2003. The new hold on executions came a day after a federal appeals court lifted a hold on the execution of Daniel Lewis Lee of Yukon, Okla., which was scheduled for 4pm ET at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.

"(Jul 23, 2020  5:19 AM CDT) Reports of people recovering from COVID-19 and then becoming sick again within months make the coronavirus seem like an almost unstoppable enemy—but virologists say fears may be overblown. Experts tell the New York Times that while it may be possible for people to become infected twice, they believe it would be very unlikely to happen within the space of a few months, or for the person to become much sicker the second time. They suspect that in at least some cases of reported reinfections, the person was wrongly declared virus-free after a test returned a false negative when the coronavirus was still lurking somewhere in their body. Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen tells the Washington Post that while experts hope immunity for recovered patients will last at least a year, it is too early in the pandemic to draw conclusion about how immunity develops or how long it persists. Michael Mina, a Harvard immunologist, says while reports that antibodies decline sharply two or three months after infection have caused alarm, he says it is completely normal for antibody levels to go very, very, high then come down after an acute infection. Clinicians are  scratching their heads, saying 'What an extraordinarily odd virus that it’s not leading to robust immunity,’ but they’re totally wrong,  Mina tells the Times.  It doesn’t get more textbook than this.  He describes reports raising fears of widespread reinfection are  sensationalist clickbait.  Experts also note that reinfections have been known to happen with many viruses, and with 15 million known coronavirus cases worldwide, reports of reinfection have been very rare. But  even rare occurrences might seem alarmingly frequent when a huge number of people have been infected,  Rasmussen says.",Experts: Don't Panic About COVID-19 Reinfection

He helped form the New Wave band with his brother Gerald in 1973 and stayed on board for decades:  Bob Casale was there in the trenches with me from the beginning,  said Gerald in a statement.  He was my level-headed brother, a solid performer and talented audio engineer, always giving more than he got.  Gerald said Bob was excited about performing with Devo again, and his death  came as a total shock to us all.  The original Devo members, who grew up in Akron, Ohio, formed the band after personally witnessing the 1970 Kent State Massacre.  We came of age in the middle of a huge cultural war,  said Bob in an Under the Radar interview two years ago.  This country was basically in the midst of a new civil war—the lines were drawn very clearly.  The band had a hit in 1980 with  Whip It,  broke up in 1991, got back together five years later, and toured for years after. Their name was based on the idea of  de-evolution —that people were devolving into a mass-herd mentality.  De-evolution happened and now everybody agrees,  Gerald told CNN.

"(May 14, 2019  4:08 PM CDT) He's a Navy SEAL who's served four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Shaun Donovan is also 37—which is why the New York Fire Department rejected him, as he was about six months older than its maximum age limit when he applied. His attorney says Donovan scored in the top 1% of applicants, passed the physical exam, and flew to New York twice for the recruitment process; he is currently still serving on active duty, but wanted to move to New York when he's eligible to retire from the Navy next year, CNN reports. The good news: Since Donovan's story started making headlines, more than a dozen fire departments across the nation have extended invitations to him to come work there instead, the New York Post reports. Donovan grew up in Arizona, but his family is originally from New York and spoke of it often, fueling his dream to live there and work with FDNY. He appealed the department's decision, but FDNY tells CNN it is not authorized to waive the age limit, which is mandated by state and city regulations and is among the strictest in the nation, for any applicant. Donovan's next step was to appeal the decision to New York City's Civil Service Commission, which is expected to make a decision by the end of July. If it doesn't go his way, his attorney says Donovan is prepared to file a civil lawsuit in federal court. Among the other fire departments that want Donovan: Denver and San Francisco.

"(Aug 30, 2012  12:17 PM CDT) If you thought the couple years you spent in braces were bad, get a load of this: Devin Bost says he was in braces from age 7 to age 18—and that the 11 years he spent wearing them left many of his teeth rotten. Now Bost, 22, is suing Brad Chvatal, the Oregon orthodontist he says is responsible. It seems you can't leave braces on that long without risking tooth decay and periodontal disease, Bost's lawyer explains to the Oregonian. Worse, some of Bost's teeth can't be replaced because they're rotted to the jaw. He's already racked up $35,000 in dental bills and counting, what with all the teeth that have needed to be replaced with implants. As for how in the world Bost could have worn braces for 11 years without realizing something was amiss—particularly since his mother is a medical doctor—the lawsuit offers little clue. He reportedly got his braces from a different orthodontist and then started going to Chvatal afterward, although he didn't make as many visits as he should have; then, in 2008, Bost got  an urgent phone call  from the orthodontist's office saying the braces needed to come off. Even Bost's lawyer admits,  We aren't really sure what happened.

I am a product guy at my core,  West tells the magazine.  To make products that make people feel an immense amount of joy and solve issues and problems in their life, that's the problem-solving that I love to do.  Indeed, his Yeezy shoe line, now with Adidas after launching with Nike in 2009, is expected to bank over $1.5 billion in 2019 and earned West $150 million pretax over the past year. And it's nothing new: West sketched sneakers back in middle school, he says, and first designed a shoe for a Japanese company in 2007. Forbes gets into Kanye's shoe brilliance—how his Yeezy Boost 350s resemble Lamborghinis and sell out in calculated 40,000-pair drops—but his eccentricities also stand out. The floors of his stark LA home are made of a rare Belgian plaster that requires a crew to fly in from Europe if they get scuffed; he credits his creative imagination partly to bipolarity, which he calls a  superpower ; and he's designing structures based on Luke Skywalker's original home on Tatooine for the homeless to live in.

That category is reserved for targets whose affiliation (ie, al-Qaeda, Taliban) isn't clear to the CIA, which NBC says raises a big question: how could these individuals then be deemed a threat to US security? It may all boil down to the use of  signature  strikes, in which targets are identified via  circumstantial evidence  like behavioral patterns and associates, says a former White House official. Up to half the Pakistan strikes in 2009 to 2010 were signature strikes, says another ex-official. Other former top Obama officials cite concerns about the accuracy of the CIA's own reporting of the attacks, including death tallies. Indeed, the numbers sometimes appear murky: One strike report says seven to 10 people were killed; another notes that 20 to 22 died. And the documents identify only one of 600 people killed in the 14-month period as a civilian. That's  just not believable,  says a former State Department adviser.

"(Feb 16, 2016  12:40 PM) How often do you use $100 bills? Never? That's probably because you're not a criminal. As Lawrence H. Summers explains at the Washington Post, there's a school of thought that high-denomination currency aids crime and even terrorism. In a new paper out of Harvard, senior fellow Peter Sands argues that  illicit activities are facilitated when a million dollars weighs 2.2 pounds —as it does when 500 euro notes are used— rather than more than 50 pounds as would be the case if the $20 bill was the high denomination note.  Indeed, the 500 euro note is called the  bin Laden  by some. The same concern applies for the $100 bill, writes Summers, a former treasure secretary who currently teaches at Harvard. Thanks to advances in technology, there is no longer a need for high denomination notes. Summers thinks removing all existing such notes is too big a step, but we should certainly stop printing new ones.  A global agreement to stop issuing notes worth more than say $50 or $100 ... would be as significant as anything else the G7 or G20 has done in years,  he says. We all want to fight corruption, and taking this step would  show that the global financial groupings can stand up against 'big money' and for the interests of ordinary citizens.

"(May 29, 2009  10:13 AM CDT) House Minority Leader John Boehner didn’t like how the House Democrats were operating, so where did he appeal? The White House, of course. More specifically, reports Politico, Boehner used the White House online suggestion box to ask the president to back a 72-hour review period before any spending bill is passed. And Boehner's suggestion has gotten more votes than any other of the online ideas, though not all are exactly models of seriousness. Wrote Boehner on the White House site,  If the administration chose to support such a review and follow through on its own promise to allow for five days of public comment on all bills before signing, it would represent a good first step toward greater transparency and accountability in government spending.  But his lead is hardly overwhelming: as of last night, he claimed first place with just 599 votes.

"(Sep 6, 2011  6:50 PM CDT) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is used to catching flak over all things monetary, so when he and wife Tonette decided to renovate the governor's mansion to its former glory, they (probably wisely) decided to do it without making taxpayers foot the bill. Unfortunately, they're not getting off scot-free. On Sept. 22, the couple will host an event to raise money for the rehab project: a two-hour private reception and croquet tournament that costs $50 to $1,000 to participate in—and not everyone is pleased with the move, reports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Those who ante up the big bucks will enjoy a  private reception, private tour, recognition on the invitation, signage, and acknowledgment at the event, and admission and (croquet) tournament entry for two.  Tonette is also leading the charge on a side money-maker: a purse raffle, where ladies will donate handbags filled with their most favorite things. (Tonette herself will chip in a Tignanello bag containing Bobbi Brown lipstick and Aveda lotion.) The croquet-purses approach isn't sitting well with everyone.

Trump's statements came a day after retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in an essay in the New York Times that repealing the amendment would make it easier for Congress to enact gun control legislation, the AP reports.

"(Jan 26, 2010  5:27 AM) New research suggests that human beings are biologically capable of running close to 40 miles an hour, a pace that's approximately 12mph faster than Usain Bolt and just 10mph slower than a lion. A man able to run at this speed would cross the finish line of 100 meters as Bolt dawdled at the 60-meter mark, the Telegraph reports. The calculation is based on an assessment of how quickly the muscle fibers themselves can contract. Scientists had thought the limiting factor in human speed was the amount of force the limbs could take striking the ground, but the researchers from the University of Wyoming say their work shows it's the  speed limit  on the muscles that are key. Their findings are published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.",Humans Capable of 40mph Run
"(Jul 15, 2017  1:50 PM CDT) In the late 1600s, three mass executions took place on a rocky ledge on the outskirts of Salem, Mass. Yes, the result of the witch trials. The city-owned site is undeveloped and largely out of view, but a new memorial aims to respectfully commemorate those who lost their lives because of superstition and intolerance, reports the Smithsonian. Salem Mayor Kimberley Driscoll plans to dedicate the site below what is called Proctor's Ledge on July 19, the same day in 1692 when five women—Sarah Good, Elizabeth Howe, Susannah Martin, Rebecca Nurse, and Sarah Wildes—were hanged from a tree on the ledge. In all, 19 people would be hanged in Salem. The site gets its name from the local Proctor family. Wealthy landowner John Proctor became a victim of the historic hysteria after he condemned the witch trials and was hanged himself. His grandson, well aware of the site's history, later bought the land. Today, especially around Halloween, tourists flock to Salem to indulge in  ghost tours  and visit sites like the Witch House, where some of the trials took place. Salem is also now home to many practitioners of the Wiccan faith. Volunteers were cleaning up the site this weekend ahead of the ceremony, notes a post at Patch.com.

"(Dec 7, 2012  1:23 PM) In a December tradition dating back to 1896, Los Angeles County officials have buried the ashes of 1,656 bodies left unclaimed by family and friends. About two dozen people, including mourners, chaplains, and soup kitchen volunteers, turned up to witness the burial in a single grave, the Los Angeles Times reports. With no names or life stories to be read, it's an unusual service, says the chaplain who leads it. Readings from Islamic, Hindu, Jewish, and Christian texts were offered in Korean, Spanish, and English, and a woman performed a Native American chant. The mass grave is traditionally marked with only the year. Unclaimed ashes often belong to homeless people or people with families who can't pay for burials or cremations, the Times notes. One mourner this year was in prison when her homeless mother died.  We tried to get her ashes, but we never got enough money,  she said.

"(Apr 30, 2019  8:12 AM CDT) Just one victim and no prior arrests. That was the rationale an upstate New York judge had last week for giving the lowest-risk sex offender designation to a former Watertown school bus driver who pleaded guilty earlier this year to raping a 14-year-old girl. Instead, per the Watertown Daily News, Jefferson County Judge James P. McClusky gave Shane M. Piche 10 years' probation and a Level 1 sex-offender designation—a status not even required to be included in online sex-offender registries. Prosecutors had sought a Level 2 sex-offender designation. With exceptions, Piche, reportedly 25 or 26, also isn't allowed to be alone with anyone under the age of 17, must pay $1,375 in fees, and has three  no contact  protection orders he must abide by. State police say Piche met the girl through his bus driver job, but the sexual assault took place at his home. The Washington Post notes Piche's case  joins a list of controversial punishments in sexual assault cases,  including that of Brock Turner, the Stanford student convicted of sexual assault who served three months of a six-month sentence. The mom of the victim says she wishes Piche had received jail time, noting in a victim impact statement seen by 7 News that  he took something from my daughter she will never get back and has caused her to struggle with depression and anxiety.  Meanwhile, USA Today cites a disturbing stat via the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network: that for every 1,000 rapes, only five perpetrators end up in jail.

Now, authorities say they finally know who is behind the attacks, the New York Times reports. The chief of the police counterterrorism unit says that an investigation discovered that two militant Islamic groups recruited and trained volunteers to carry out the killings, and that authorities think they've identified the leaders of both groups and are working on bringing them in. Things started coming together for authorities after a 23-year-old was found to be carrying a machete and a pistol and was arrested recently. Six days later, two 19-year-old men were arrested while fleeing the site of one of the fatal attacks, and they said the 23-year-old was also involved in the attacks. From there, other revelations followed. Authorities say the goal of the terrorist groups was to convert Bangladesh from a mix of religions to a strictly Islamist culture.

Police have charged nine in the attack, as well as similar attacks earlier in the day on two teenagers linked to the man, reports the New York Times. Police say gang members beat and sodomized a 17-year-old who wanted to join their ranks after spotting him with the 30-year-old. The teen admitted having sex with the man.

After emptying her bank account, 38-year-old Louise Pietrewicz vanished from her family's Long Island farm in October 1966.

But then a Suffolk Times investigation published in October brought renewed interest to the case. Boken's former wife—who had no contact with Boken in the 14 years prior to his death—then directed police to the basement of the Southold home the couple occupied at the time of Pietrewicz's disappearance, saying a body had been buried there, reports the Suffolk Times.

The agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, Calif. headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran, and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge, the AP reports. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale, where regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste before notifying the state about its activities. Apple described its conduct as  an oversight in paperwork  that didn't affect its health and safety standards. The complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. Regulators say the  baghouse  dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc, and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, Calif., located about 140 miles away. That center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada. Settling the case cost Apple a relative pittance: The company reported revenue of $234 billion in 2015, meaning the settlement cost it a little over 1 minute's income.",Apple Pays 1 Minute's Income to Settle Hazardous Waste Case

"(Jun 5, 2019  1:35 PM CDT) Authorities say an Ohio doctor is responsible for the deaths of 25 patients for whom he prescribed excessive doses of the opioid painkiller fentanyl. William Husel has been charged in all those deaths following a six-month investigation, reports NBC News, which calls the deaths  a stunning case of medical oversight.  Nurses and pharmacists followed Husel's orders, which prosecutors say had no legitimate medical reasoning, but Husel is the main focus of the investigation. Even so, 30 hospital employees have been placed on leave and another 18 with connections to the case no longer work at the medical center. Per 10TV and the Columbus Dispatch, Husel is accused of ordering excessive painkiller doses for 35 patients, all of whom died, but authorities believe not all of them died due to the overdoses. In all cases, the families had opted to withdraw lifesaving measures. Husel, 43, was employed at Mount Carmel Health System as an intensive care doctor from 2015 to 2018, the time period when the deaths took place. He was suspended Nov. 21, fired two weeks later, and had his medical license suspended in January. When police first revealed the investigation in January, they said they were probing deaths that may have been hastened by excessive doses of fentanyl. In announcing the charges, Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien said many of the patients involved were not alert when the potentially fatal doses were administered:  If someone could not feel pain, there would be no legitimate medical reason  to do such a thing, he said. The patients are said to have been near death. A motive remains unclear. If convicted, Husel faces 15 years to life in prison per count. He pleaded not guilty Wednesday.

This is kind of a bottom line for the president,  Reuters quotes a senior White House official as saying. The plan unveiled Thursday would provide a possibility of citizenship—contingent on  work, education, and good moral character —to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, USA Today reports. That's a million more Dreamers than were protected by DACA. The White House calls it a  dramatic concession  to Democrats. In return for that concession, the White House is asking for a $25 billion  trust fund  to build parts of President Trump's long-promised wall on the Mexican border and improve security on the Canadian border. More money would go to additional border guards and immigration judges. The plan restricts family-based immigration to only spouses and minor children. That change represents a 25% reduction in legal immigration into the US—about 250,000 people per year. The plan also ends the visa lottery system, which provides 50,000 visas a year to people from countries under-represented in the US. Another part of the plan closes what the White House calls  legal loopholes  in order to allow for the deportation of more immigrants.

"(Oct 20, 2016  12:21 PM CDT) New research may have solved a  deep-rooted mystery  about our solar system and lent credence to the theory that there's a ninth planet chilling beyond Pluto. (Sorry, buddy.) Researchers at Caltech, including Konstantin Batygin and Mike  Pluto Killer  Brown (who first floated the  Planet Nine  theory), say evidence of the massive body has been right under our noses—or actually above our heads—all this time: The planet may cause the sun to appear tilted. How? Well, the orbits of all other planets in our solar system are mostly flat, yet the zone in which they orbit the sun is tilted about six degrees off the sun's equator, per a press release. A massive hidden planet with an orbit set 30 degrees off the other planets' orbits would explain why that is. Such a planet would give the solar system  no choice but to slowly twist,  study author Elizabeth Bailey says, and calculations apparently check out, per the Guardian. There are other possibilities—that the planets were created this way or the sun's core influenced the orbits early on—but  Planet Nine is the first thing that has been proposed to tilt the solar system that doesn't depend on early conditions, so if we find Planet Nine, we will be able to see if it's the only thing responsible,  Bailey tells Space.com. Separate research from the University of Arizona notes a massive planet would also explain odd orbits in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond Neptune's orbit.

"(Jan 23, 2019  2:43 PM) The Ancient Greeks took it as a sign that Alexander the Great was a god. A New Zealand researcher says it's actually an important clue into the ruler's demise. Dr. Katherine Hall explains that upon Alexander's death in 323BC, it was recorded that his body went six days without exhibiting signs of decomposition. The leading theories as to what killed him—infection, alcoholism or murder—don't explain that. And Hall, of the University of Otago's Dunedin School of Medicine, thinks she knows what does. The twist? She thinks Alexander wasn't decomposing because he was still alive. Here's her theory: that he contracted the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) from a common infection of the time. GBS would have cause the  progressive, symmetrical, ascending paralysis  he was noted as experiencing prior to death. And that death really came six days later than thought, theorizes Hall in an article published in the Ancient History Bulletin. She says that in that era, death was determined by a cessation of breathing, not pulse. The GBS-caused paralysis and reduced oxygen needs would have made his breathing less obvious, notes a press release. The Otago Daily Times reports it's a theory that Hall says was floated once before, in 1978, but was  never seriously taken up by anyone else.  She spent six months researching the topic.

"(Feb 18, 2015  12:16 PM) Considering a job at Appster? Sure! Just send in your résumé, spend an average of 15 hours interviewing, and score in the top 5% worldwide on competency tests, and maybe you'll get hired. Fortune reports the Australian app-development company re-engineered its approach after calculating that only about half its hires ended up working out. Fast Company details the current hiring process: It all begins with the company imagining an ideal hire. Then, an HR person sifts through résumés and holds phone interviews; some 10% to 20% of applicants will be sent on to the next step. Some 70% of those people will then be cut in competency tests that require them to score in that top 5% bracket, co-founder Josiah Humphrey tells Fast Company. Next is a half-day interview, followed by an additional three-to-five-hour one. In that second meeting, one of the two interviewers spends the time examining your body language. And you might be asked to come in and do a trial workday. Of course, the team is also investigating your references behind the scenes, and the process involves about 22 hours of work for them per candidate.  You start seeing glimmers of people's personalities they can't hide, things you would never be able to see in a traditional job interview,  co-founder Mark McDonald told Business Insider in November. The goal, he says, is to ensure hires (50 of its 130 employees joined in the past three months) stay on for the long haul, and about 90% now do. A common thread shared by those who get the job? The ability to freely and extensively talk about one's career; Fortune reports this tends to indicate the candidate is qualified and has no skeletons in his or her employment closet.

"(Jul 27, 2012  2:43 AM CDT) It's been more than three years since Bernie Madoff's giant Ponzi scheme was discovered, resulting in $17 billion in lost principle for his investors. But now the trustee in charge of Madoff's bankruptcy says he's ready to give the stolen funds back to the duped investors—well, give back $2.4 billion of the money owed, reports the Wall Street Journal. That's more than double the $1.1 billion already returned to about 1,000 people who were taken in by Madoff's scheme. If the judge approves the trustee's request, the victims could receive an average of $2 million each by this fall. The trustee has recovered $11 billion of the scammed money so far, but lawsuits by the investors are slowing down the repayment rate. Some investors claim they are owed 9% interest on their Ponzi money (the trustee says  no ). Others want the recovered money to be distributed based on how much Madoff claimed was in their accounts when the Ponzi scheme fell apart (the trustee is distributing based on actual losses). But for those who lost their life savings, many have given up waiting, and are selling their claims for 80 cents on the dollar.",Madoff Trustee Ready to Repay $2.4B
"(Sep 9, 2013  12:39 PM CDT) Last month, the CIA acknowledged it: Area 51 is real, and it was used to test spy planes. But the news seems largely to have washed over Americans without any pushback, and that's a shame, writes Joseph Lapin at Salon. Not only did the government keep another secret from us—it actually told people that the odd objects they spotted flying around were in fact just tricks of the light or weather balloons.  Why are we not more outraged that for half a century our government has been feeding misinformation to its citizens?  Lapin wonders. One answer:  The timing  of the news, amid revelations about the NSA and other government programs. Still, Lapin wonders:  How does it affect the American psyche when people who clearly see something are told they are wrong?  Experts note that Americans are OK with giving up some freedoms in exchange for perceived protection. But  by controlling and choosing how to disseminate information, the government becomes a major stakeholder in what is real—and what is not,  Lapin writes.  For the officials we trust to protect our freedoms, truth and reality are malleable.  And our reaction, it seems, is  apathy.

Instead, Manita Singh was surprised to deliver a set of very premature quintuplets. She was unaware she was carrying five babies because she and husband Mahesh were unable to afford an ultrasound.  I am extremely grateful to God for blessing us with not one but five children,  the Inquisitr quotes Mahesh as saying.  I believe God has compensated the loss  of the couple's first child, he adds. The couple has named the girls Jiya, Jjanv, Jyoti, Jigayasa, and Janya. A priest had advised them to start each name with the letter  J,  the Times of India reports. But it's not all good news for what doctors say are likely India's  most premature  quintuplets ever. The Times of India reports the babies weigh between 2.2. and 3.3 pounds each and are being kept in intensive care because of their low birth weights. Four of the babies are suffering from jaundice. One hospital executive warns the survival rate for such premature babies is  abysmally low.  If they survive, the quintuplets will receive financial support from the government. Manita and Mahesh live in a single room and have the equivalent of $7.50 in their bank account. Mahesh says he hopes his new children survive and that he can provide them with a  wonderful life.

"(Sep 25, 2014  7:05 AM CDT) Mass shootings really are on the rise, according to a new FBI report. There has been an average of nearly one mass shooting a month in America this century and the rate has risen dramatically in recent years, the report released yesterday says. The agency says it identified a total of 160  active shooter  incidents—defined as  an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area —since 2000, and found most happened in a matter of minutes, and around two-thirds of them were over before police arrived, reports the Wall Street Journal. There were an average of 6.4 mass shootings a year between 2000 and 2006, not including gang violence and domestic incidents, but the rate soared to an average of 16.4 a year between 2007 and 2013, according to the report, which the FBI says aims to help law enforcement agencies  prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from these incidents.  A total of 486 people were killed and 557 wounded in the incidents, notes the New York Times, not including the shooters, 40% of whom committed suicide. Only six of the shooters were women. At a briefing yesterday, an FBI behavioral analyst said that many shooters  have a real or perceived deeply held personal grievance and the only remedy that they can perceive for that grievance is an act of catastrophic violence against a person or an institution,  CNN reports. Chillingly, he explained that the  copycat phenomenon is real  and there appear to be a growing number of  compromised and marginal individuals who are seeking inspiration from these past attacks.",Mass Shootings Have Nearly Tripled Since 2006: FBI

Today Paul Mason, once the heaviest man in the world, is a new man, and Justin Heckert reports on his amazing transformation for GQ. It was seven years ago this winter when  Man Mountain  (what the British media called Mason) decided  he didn't want to die  and that he wanted more out of life than being stuck on a 10-foot mattress. And so he chanced the surgery that had a 50% risk of leading to his death if certain complications (a heart attack, organ failure, a blood clot) developed. His doctor, bariatric surgeon Shaw Somers, even asked Mason if he was willing to put his life on the line to lose weight, a question to which Mason responded with a weepy yes. Mason wasn't always overweight as a youth, though he was always tall: He reached nearly 6 feet at just 9 years old. A strict dad who made him consume huge plates of food, sexual abuse at the hands of an aunt, and a love affair that suddenly ended when was in his 20s led him further into the snacking spiral, and as the years went by, the weight piled on—in one six-month stretch, he put on 150 pounds.  I let all my dignity go; I just didn't care,  he says. His gastric bypass surgery and the lifestyle changes he made afterward dropped him down to just under 300 pounds, but Heckert notes Mason's new life  full of wonder  was  still defined by all his old burdens,  including medical issues, a lack of money, and a tough time finding a partner.

These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as  a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves.

What's more, Feld is pressing cases against other animal-rights groups in an attempt to recoup a reported $20 million in legal costs. But the ASPCA isn't admitting to any wrongdoing, and notes that the court never ruled on its elephant-abuse allegations. The case apparently hinged on a former circus worker whose testimony was dismissed because activists had paid him. But Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the Humane Society of the US, is vowing to fight on:  We'll continue to make our case to the public, even as Ringling files frivolous and retaliatory legal actions to divert and distract from its abuse of elephants.",Animal Rights Group Pays Circus $9.3M
"(Jan 17, 2012  11:54 AM) A major snowstorm is expected to hit Seattle tonight, dumping as much as a foot by tomorrow evening. And it looks like things will get worse: Weather.com is predicting up to 18 inches in parts of the Seattle area within 48 hours; MSNBC notes that is three times the city's average annual snowfall of 5.9 inches. Other sections of Washington could see even more—and as much as 3.5 feet could hit the Cascades. In Portland, where the average annual snowfall is 2.4 inches, up to 8 inches of snow are expected. One meteorologist predicts it will be  the biggest snowstorm in years,  and another warns of  very adverse, hazardous winter conditions.  Mountain driving has already turned dangerous, and other travel could become  dangerous or impossible,  says another meteorologist. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer notes that conditions are similar to a highly destructive 1996 storm that caused landslides when the snow turned to rain, as this snow may do tomorrow or Thursday.

"(Nov 24, 2019  11:02 AM) Tesla received 146,000 preorders for its upcoming Cybertruck in the first two days after its unveiling, CEO Elon Musk said. A $100 refundable payment comes with each preorder, the Verge reports, which means the company has already collected $14.6 million for the electric pickup. Production won't begin until 2021. Musk tweeted Saturday that that success happened  with no advertising & no paid endorsement  — though of course there was media coverage of the event at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Tesla shares fell 6.1% Friday, per CNBC, after the rocky unveiling. Deutsche Bank said in a note that  the shattering of the truck’s unbreakable glass windows during the live demonstration was not a good start.  Some analysts said the design is a mistake, and others thought it would sell. Preordering other Tesla models required putting down $1,000 or $2,500. Customers are asked to configure the model of their choice when they preorder, as well.","146K Orders Have Rolled In for Cybertrucks, Musk Says"

"(Nov 22, 2016  7:05 AM) Outdoors outfitter Patagonia is taking an unusual approach to Black Friday: CEO Rose Marcario says 100% of the day's sales online and in its 80 locations worldwide will go toward groups that help the environment. CNN Money estimates that will amount to $2 million. The chain also made headlines earlier this month when it closed its stores on Election Day to encourage people to vote for a candidate who would help the environment, notes Adweek. The Black Friday idea was born in the wake of the election, with the VP of environmental activism noting that during these  divisive  times,  the environment is something we can all come together on.  Patagonia's money will be handled by One Percent for the Planet, a network of green organizations around the world.  These are small groups, often underfunded and under the radar, who work on the front lines,  says Marcario, adding the planet  badly needs a gift or two (and still gets coal every year).  Since 1985, Patagonia has donated 1% of its sales, or $74 million, to the environment, but Marcario says the need is now more urgent than ever. Meanwhile, fellow outdoors outfitter REI will stay closed on Black Friday for a second year in a row as it encourages employees to get outside, reports the Consumerist.

"(May 19, 2011  4:24 PM CDT) Though fewer people are getting married, more who do are sticking with it, census data shows. Some three-quarters of couples who wed after 1990 saw a 10-year anniversary—3 percentage points higher than those who wed in the early 1980s. That’s when the divorce rate reached its peak in the US, the Washington Post reports. The longer marriages are attributable in part to people getting hitched later in life, after they’ve finished their educations, sociologists say. Older brides and grooms are more mature and more financially stable.  People seem to be finding a new marriage bargain that works for 21st-century couples,  notes one analyst.  It’s based on pooling two incomes, replacing the old breadwinner-homemaker bargain that worked well in the ’50s.",More Marriages Are Lasting at Least 10 Years: Census

"(Mar 27, 2014  4:23 PM CDT) With the March 31 deadline for open enrollment approaching—or sort of approaching—the Obama administration said today that it has already hit its revised goal of getting 6 million people to sign up, reports the Washington Post. The original goal set by the Congressional Budget Office had been 7 million, but that got reduced after the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The administration said the website had 1.5 million visitors yesterday alone.  We're at a level that's likely to support a healthy system,  said Obama aide Cecilia Munoz, as quoted by USA Today.  The insurers are feeling pretty good about where we are, and so are we.  The Wall Street Journal notes an interesting shift in strategy by the agency in charge of enrollment: a focus on the penalties. In an email to people who had applied for coverage on the website but still hadn't chosen a plan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service issued a reminder that  you could pay a fee of up to 1% of your income on your 2014 taxes  by missing the deadline. While the White House and President Obama himself have kept the ObamaCare message upbeat,  enrollment activists and pollsters are finding that the threat of a penalty is one of the most important factors in lower-income uninsured people deciding to find coverage,  writes Louise Radnofsky.

"(Mar 18, 2014  10:55 AM CDT) A 10-year-old girl was attacked by what may have been a shark off Australia's east coast and suffered an injury to her hand, officials said today. Paramedics were called to a beach at Lennox Head, 120 miles south of Brisbane, after receiving a report the girl had been bitten on the wrist, a spokeswoman for the New South Wales state ambulance service said. Paramedics treated the girl at the scene and took her to a local hospital, where she was later reported in stable condition. Though initial reports pegged it as a shark attack, the Australian notes that a hospital rep says the truth of that is unclear, and a local surfer claims the girl suffered only a mackerel bite. (A police rep also seemed to dial down reports of a serious hand injury, saying the child's thumb suffered a scratch.) Although sharks are common off Australia's coast, the country averages fewer than two fatal attacks per year.

She speaks calmly and deliberately, inspiring the kind of trust that would ease any jewelry store employee eager to make a high-dollar sale. And that's exactly how cops say the 85-year-old has managed to walk off with pricey jewels in countless thefts around the world over six decades. Asked about her exploits, she speaks in broad terms laced with insinuation, refusing to give specifics of how she selects a target or what she says.  I don't dictate what happens when I walk in the store. The people in charge dictate what happens with me when I walk in the store,  Payne recently told the AP.  I don't tell a person in the store I want to see something that costs $10,000. They make those decisions based on how I present myself and how I look.  Asked about jewelry she's said to have stolen, Payne interrupts the question.  I've never, ever walked out of a jewelry store with a piece of stolen merchandise in my purse, in my pocket,  she said.  Never. I've never, ever concealed.  Police would dispute her claim. She was arrested in October and accused of pocketing a $690 pair of earrings from a Christian Dior boutique in a Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Atlanta. Payne was raised in West Virginia and moved with her family to Ohio when she was a teenager. After high school, she worked in a nursing home on and off for about four years. That's the only  real job  she ever had.  I could have been more than what I was,  she said.  I'm aware of that.  Asked to describe what she's been in her life, she's quick to answer:  I was a thief. You know that,  she said with a chuckle. The legend of Payne's thefts have long fascinated the public and media. And while she said she doesn't have an ego, she wouldn't mind seeing a movie made about her life. Her pick to star: Kerry Washington from Scandal.

On Thursday, a jury awarded the New Jersey banker and his wife a total of $37 million in compensatory damages in his suit—$30 million for him, $7 million for his wife, Kendra—making J&J assume 70% of the liability for Lanzo's illness, per CNN. Imerys Talc, the supplier of the talc, a mineral that's been linked to cross-contamination with asbestos when being mined, was hit with the other 30% liability. Reuters notes it's J&J's first loss at trial regarding complaints about its talc products containing asbestos. There are thousands of other cases tying its talc products to ovarian cancer. In Lanzo's situation, he said he got deadly mesothelioma from inhaling baby powder dust during regular use since his 1972 birth.

"(Mar 30, 2016  2:10 AM CDT) Detroit's battered public school system got another black eye on Tuesday when federal prosecutors filed bribery charges against 12 current and former principals over an alleged school supply scam. US Attorney Barbara McQuade says the sordid scheme involved businessman Norman Shy, who allegedly scammed Detroit Public Schools for millions, paying more than $900,000 in kickbacks along the way, CBS News reports. The 74-year-old  would submit fraudulent invoices for school supplies. The principals would approve those invoices and then he would provide some, but not all, of the goods that he promised to sell,  McQuade says.  In exchange for approving these fraudulent invoices, Norman Shy paid bribes to these principals.  The alleged payoffs ranged from $4,000 to $194,000. Prosecutors say Shy tried to disguise the kickbacks, which were delivered through cash, gift cards, and, in at least one case, renovation work on a principal's home, the Detroit Free Press reports. Shy and a school administrator have also been charged over the scheme, which McQuade says is a  punch in the gut  but not connected to the huge financial problems of the school district, which has been overseen by a state-appointed emergency manager since 2009.

The danger begins in the womb and continues as children are exposed to such factors as dirty air and water, poor sanitation, inadequate hygiene, and second-hand smoke, per a WHO report released Monday. The results can last for life. Some 44% of child asthma cases are believed to be linked to pollutants. Other risks include pneumonia, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.  Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water,  says WTO chief Margaret Chan. An estimated 90% of the world's population breathes air that falls short of WHO standards, per CNN. But it's not only the outside environment that imperils children. Dirty coal fires and animal dung used for heating and cooking also pose risks, as do chemicals tainting food and water.

"(Jan 16, 2016  5:15 PM) Japanese researchers have successfully awakened a microscopic tardigrade (more colloquially known as a waterbear) after it spent three decades in a subzero slumber, the Telegraph reports. That's a new record; previous Antarctic specimens were revived after about eight years, per the study, published last month in  Cryobiology . In November 1983, moss samples were collected during a Japanese Antarctic expedition and stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit. In March 2014, researchers thawed the specimens and found two tardigrades whose bodies were not fully extended, extension being a mark of tardigrade death. They were dubbed Sleeping Beauty-1 and Sleeping Beauty-2; an extracted egg was called Sleeping Beauty-3. SB-2 died after 20 days—but the other made a total recovery and the once-frozen egg hatched. The study charts SB-1's emergence:  SB-1 started to slowly crawl on the agar surface of the culture well on day 9, and started to eat the algal food provided.  It ultimately laid 19 eggs, of which 14 hatched. As for the egg SB-3, it hatched 6 days after rehydration and laid 15 eggs, of which 7 hatched. The goal of the undertaking is  to unravel the mechanism for long-term survival by looking into damage to tardigrades' DNA and their ability to repair it,  says a researcher, per the BBC.

"(Nov 20, 2015  9:24 AM) A third body has been pulled from the wreckage of Wednesday's police raid north of Paris, the New York Times reports. The body of alleged attack mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud was positively identified Thursday, and forensics experts also confirmed the body of Hasna Aitboulahcen, said to be Abaaoud's cousin, per the Guardian. The third body found at the scene of the Saint-Denis raid has yet to be IDed, and there's some confusion on the gender: The Guardian says it's  understood to be a man,  while Sky News reports it's a female. And a lawyer for Omar Abaaoud, Abdelhamid's father, says the family is upset that Abdelhamid wasn't captured alive—not because of familial devotion, but because they want to know where Abdelhamid's younger brother Younes is, per the Times. A security source tells Reuters that a younger brother IDed as Yassine Abaaoud has been in Moroccan custody since October, though it's unclear if Younes and Yassine are the same person. French police stayed busy Thursday into Friday, conducting 182 raids that brought in dozens of weapons and 17 detainees, the Wall Street Journal reports. And two Belgian men appeared in a Brussels court Friday, accused of driving missing suspect Salah Abdeslam to the Belgian capital after the attacks, the Times notes. The lawyer for Brussels native Hamza Attou, 21, said he and Moroccan-born Mohamed Amri, 27, got a call at 2am on Saturday and  simply went to get Salah, without knowing  what was going on. They figured  something had happened in Paris ... but didn't suspect anything,  Amri's lawyer said, adding Abdeslam seemed  stressed out  during the ride back to Belgium.

Taner Yildiz said today that the death toll from the May 13 explosion and fire that devastated a coal mine in Soma is 301. He said 485 miners escaped or were rescued.  All corners of the mine were searched by a large team, and there was no other body or living person.  Now the focus will turn to investigating what happened, he said. Government and mining officials have insisted that the disaster was not caused by negligence and that the mine was inspected regularly. But many miners and their families disagree, leading to protests in which riot police used tear gas.  The company is guilty,  says one miner, adding that managers had machines that measure methane gas levels.  The new gas levels had gotten too high and they didn't tell us in time.

The wedding party had been rafting on the Delaware River—and, perhaps not surprisingly, drinking—on Aug. 30, and the 29-year-old bridesmaid told police she was so intoxicated she kept falling off her paddleboard into the water; she was put onto a raft instead and couldn't remember much after that. By the time the group arrived at Monroe County's Shawnee Inn, she says, she couldn't stand on her own, and the bride-to-be of 28-year-old Daniel J. Carney asked him to help her to the parking lot. She says she woke up in the men's locker room with Carney biting and grabbing her; she then passed out again and says this time she woke up to Carney on top of her, with her bikini bottom pulled down. Then the bride-to-be walked in. The bride-to-be screamed at Carney, per the bridesmaid, and police say the couple physically fought, WNEP reports.  It was chaos amongst the entire wedding party  that night and the next day, she says. Carney allegedly tried to tell people she'd followed him into the locker room, but he also apologized to her the next day and said he didn't know what had happened. The morning of the wedding he again apologized, asked her to take day-after contraception, and asked  can we just be as happy as possible  for the sake of his wife-to-be. The day after that, the bridesmaid went to a hospital and cops were called. They say they have surveillance tape showing Carney pulling her into the locker room and heard a phone call in which he admitted to the assault.

And what the unmanned X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle was doing for all that time is, as they say, classified. The shuttle-like craft came in without a hitch at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, completing its third—and longest—secret mission. Another is planned for next year. Rumors abound about what the spacecraft is up to, with everything from launching satellites, to spying on China's space lab, to killing satellites being floated, reports CNET and the BBC. But the latter site thinks the most credible explanation is more mundane: The spaceplane might be testing technology that will be used in future space missions.  If you consider how expensive a satellite mission is—several hundred million dollars—you'd like to be sure that any innovations are going to work straight out of the box.  Testing prototypes aboard the X-37B, then, could save expensive mistakes down the line.

But she relapsed the following year ( When I was 13, that was probably the lowest  point in her life, she says), leading to 18 more months in a hospital.  [My parents] were pretty out there,  Barrymore says.  But I realized, honestly, yeah, my mom locked me up in an institution. Boo hoo! But it did give an amazing discipline. It was like serious recruitment training and boot camp, and it was horrible and dark and very long-lived, a year and a half, but I needed it. I needed that whole insane discipline.  She clarifies that, yes, it was an institution for the mentally ill. The 40-year-old Barrymore—while sipping a Corona—notes that at 14,  I was so scared of not knowing where I was going. I really had a fear that I was going to die at 25,  but that  no matter how dark shit got, I always had a sense that there should be goodness. I never went all the way into darkness.  Her mother  occasionally  visited her at the hospital, she says, but when she got out at 14, she became legally emancipated from her parents, at the institution's suggestion.  It was a very important thing to experience for me,  she says of her hospitalization.  It was very humbling, very quieting.

"(May 16, 2018  4:58 PM CDT) Don’t cry for your busy CEO. A comprehensive survey of executive pay has found that the average CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio in the US has reached 339 to 1, reports the Guardian. Simply put, median workers at most of the companies surveyed would need to work 45 years to earn what the CEO makes in one year. This figure is higher than that of other industrialized countries, where CEOs make less, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Published by Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the study looked at the earnings of nearly 14 million workers at 225 companies with total annual revenues of $6.3 trillion. Among the findings: In 188 of the 225 companies surveyed, the pay of the CEO could be used to pay more than 100 workers. The gaps are most apparent in the fast food and retail industries, which had a 977 to 1 ratio. The findings are consistent with another recent report by the compensation research firm Equilar. Equilar evaluated pay at the 100 largest public companies by revenue and found that in 2017 the median CEO pay package was about $15.7 million, its highest figure since Equilar first started analyzing pay in 2007, the Washington Post reported at the time. The biggest earner was Broadcom’s Hock Tan, who brought in a breathtaking $103.2 million. The pay disparity rankles Sarah Anderson, policy director at Inequality.org, who says it could be historic.

The average 30-year fixed rate hit 5.44% from 5.29% the day before and 5.03% Tuesday. The rates make it tougher for homeowners to lower payments by refinancing, which in turn can hurt consumer spending.

The cause of death of the woman, who was in her 20s, was determined only after her autopsy, reports USA Today. Her illness is likely linked to an outbreak that took place in Clallam County in the spring: She was reportedly treated at a medical center at the same time as another patient who later developed a rash and was determined to be contagious for measles; the paper notes the disease can be spread even before outward symptoms manifest. The woman's death makes it the sixth confirmed measles case in Clallam County, and the 11th in Washington this year, per the Times. Many of the cases nationwide—178 so far this year, notes the CDC—were part of a larger outbreak believed to have started in Disneyland.

The American people have spoken. They demand that Washington stop its out-of-control spending now, not some time in the future,  says freshman Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan. The measure passed largely on the might of the House's 87-member class of budget-conscious freshmen, and faces a fight in the Democrat-controlled Senate, reports the AP. Among the targets were Planned Parenthood, the ethanol industry, and the EPA, whose budget was slashed by about a third. The Pentagon was awarded a 2% increase, while the AP notes that domestic agencies largely saw around 12% in cuts. Click for more on the budget brawl.",House Passes $60B in Cuts
"(Mar 1, 2016  6:00 AM) With an eye on curbing industrial overcapacity and pollution, China is planning to lay off state workers—millions of them. The Daily Times reports 1.8 million workers, or 15% of the workforce, will be laid off in the coal and steel industries. However, two sources with ties to the country's leadership tell Reuters the figure could reach up to 6 million across seven sectors, including cement, glassmaking, and shipbuilding, over the next two to three years. Reuters calls it  Beijing's boldest retrenchment program in almost two decades.  Some 37 million people were employed by the state in 2013.  It's difficult to predict a time frame,  a researcher says of the coal and steel layoffs.  There are many issues to be dealt with, including how to pay debt as well as layoffs.  The government has set aside $23 million to cover the coal and steel layoffs—another $7 million will help workers relocate over three years—but millions more will be needed for other industries. Funding will also be needed to cover the debt left by so-called  zombie  state firms that have essentially closed but keep paying employees in areas where local officials fear bankruptcies and unemployment. Back in December, China's Premier Li Keqiang promised zombie firms would  go under the knife.  Business Insider Australia reports  activity levels at Chinese manufacturing firms contracted at the fastest pace seen since November 2011 last month, adding to concerns that growth in the world’s second largest economy is continuing to slow.",Report: China Will Lay Off Up to 6M Workers

Darryl Wright, a former Idaho National Guardsman, appeared for sentencing Thursday in US District Court, where Judge Benjamin Settle said he wanted to hear additional testimony about Wright's mental health before issuing a punishment. Prosecutors are seeking a five-year prison term, arguing that Wright falsified statements from fellow soldiers to obtain two awards—a Combat Action Badge and the Purple Heart—and then parlayed those medals into a wide range of disability and other benefits, including forgiveness of more than $40,000 in student loans. In applications for benefits, Wright claimed to be so severely disabled that he could only focus his attention for five to 10 seconds, and he said he needed a live-in caregiver. In reality, he served as chairman of his city's planning commission, coached high school basketball, and had held a full-time federal government job in Seattle. Wright claimed Social Security disability benefits, insisting he was frequently bedridden. He also allegedly submitted fabricated National Guard orders in an effort to be paid for a week of skipped work. Wright pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud early this year. Wright's Purple Heart has not been rescinded, prosecutors said.","Vet Fakes War Injuries to Get Purple Heart, $750K in Benefits"

In a post on, of course, Facebook, Zuckerberg explains that he has dropped his controversial plan to create non-voting shares in the company because his shares have become so valuable that he can sell enough to fund his philanthropy and  retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more,  TechCrunch reports. Facebook  was not originally founded to be a company, but to accomplish a social mission,  he says. The stock has soared to more than $170 a share, meaning Zuckerberg's sell-off could raise up to $12.8 billion. Zuckerberg's earlier plan to create a new class of shares would have allowed him to sell off almost all his stock and still retain control of the company, but it was deeply unpopular with other shareholders, Bloomberg reports. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have pledged to give away most of their fortune. Zuckerberg says the share sale will fund work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative including efforts at  curing all diseases in our children's lifetime and personalizing education for every student.

"(Feb 21, 2013  1:06 PM) A group of doctors have assembled a list of more than 90 medical procedures that are overused, often useless, and even harmful, in a bid to drive Americans toward consuming less care. The report, from ABIM Foundation's Choosing Wisely program calls out everything from Pap tests (which it argues shouldn't be routine) to CT scans (which shouldn't be used for minor head injuries to children) to caesarean deliveries, which, when performed early, increase a baby's risk of learning disabilities or death, Forbes and the LA Times report.  Millions of Americans are increasingly realizing that when it comes to health care, more is not necessarily better,  one doctor said. The list was created with the help of 25 medical societies with specialists hailing from 17 disciplines. The foundation thinks the over-treating is a major driver of the US' sky-high medical costs; American doctors, for instance, perform almost twice as many CT scans and MRIs as doctors in the rest of the world.

After starting the class in January, Ujimori was upset her then-4-pound dog, who she was trying to socialize, was in the same class with older, bigger dogs and was kept in a separate area, the Washington Post reports. She asked for a pro-rated refund but never got one, posted the aforementioned review plus a similarly negative one on Angie's List, and was hit with the defamation lawsuit from Dog Tranquility owner Colleen Dermott. In the Yelp section listing Dog Tranquility reviews removed for violating  content guidelines or terms of service,  there are three from a  J U. ; one was made Jan. 28, the other two March 14.

Dermott says Ujimori was told in advance about the makeup of the class and the gated-off area, signed a contract that specifies there are no refunds, and didn't accept her offer of a credit for a future class. Ujimori is publicly fighting the suit because she believes legislators should pass laws against such suits, which she says have  a chilling effect on First Amendment rights.

Islamist parties had a strong showing in Egypt's first round of polling, and the regions voting today—which include Giza, Luxor, Aswan, and Ismailia—historically lean toward religious conservatives, CNN reports. One secular party, the Egyptian Bloc, has even tried to capitalize on the lopsided votes, and adopted the slogan  For a more balanced parliament.

In the 24 hours after his death, plays of Michael's songs on Spotify increased by 3,100%. And 10 of his songs suddenly appeared in iTunes' top 100 list.  The music already, in terms of streaming and downloads, has increased significantly since news of his death,  attorney Donald David tells People. David says the posthumous increase in popularity could add up to $10 million to Michael's estate over the next two years.",George Michael Worth $125M at Time of Death
"(Nov 22, 2011  12:29 PM) A California teen will go to prison for 21 years for shooting his gay classmate to death in a middle school computer lab in 2008. The plea deal was reached yesterday; in Brandon McInerney’s first trial, the jury deadlocked. In order to avoid a second trial, McInerney, now 17, pleaded guilty to second-degree and voluntary manslaughter, and prosecutors agreed not to pursue another trial—which could have potentially landed McInerney a life sentence. The father of victim Larry King said the family supports the deal, but still places blame at the feet of school officials. Administrators were aware of growing conflicts between King, who liked to flirt with boys, and male students on campus; teachers were asked in a memo to report any safety concerns. But the teachers who testified said when they attempted to report tension, they were rebuffed by school leaders, the Los Angeles Times reports. King’s mother, Dawn, also revealed yesterday that she had asked officials for help  containing  Larry’s behavior just days before his death, because she feared  something serious was going to happen —but she was also turned away.",Teen in Gay Murder Case Gets 21 Years

"(Jan 19, 2017  12:15 AM) Jewish centers across America were evacuated Wednesday after what security analysts say was an unprecedented number of threats. The FBI and the Justice Department say they're investigating the bomb threats phoned in to at least 27 Jewish community centers in 17 states, Reuters reports. Wednesday's threats follow a wave of bomb threats made to 16 Jewish centers in nine states on Jan. 9, and the FBI says that in both cases, the suspect or suspects disguised their voices and used an automated robo-call system for some, but not all, of the calls. Authorities say no bombs were found in any of the threatened locations. Paul Goldenberg of Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish institutions in the US, tells the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that there were 30 threats and that in most cases, the caller was a woman who hung up after issuing a brief threat. Mark Freedman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Nashville and Middle Tennessee, tells the JTA that the community won't be intimidated by  telephone terrorism.   Clearly it's a pattern of intimidation, and it’s likely to continue in the current atmosphere that we have in this country, where hate groups feel that they can come after good-standing members of the community,  he says.

"(Aug 11, 2011  1:05 PM CDT) Sure, most of the nation is intensely focused on the 2012 election, but Brent Budowsky is already looking forward to 2016's ideal candidate: Al Gore. In a glowing endorsement for the Hill, Budowsky calls for a  national movement  to draft Gore to  carry the banner of the New Frontier heritage of the Democratic Party.  Gore is both the  conscience  and the  soul  of true Democrats, Budowsky argues, and he has the  fighting spirit  that we need. Not only would Gore be  the most qualified candidate for the presidency in a century,  he would also be the best hope to  renew the battle for what Ted Kennedy brilliantly called the causes that endure and the dreams that never die.  It's time to  build anew, organize again, and set the stage for another great historic Democratic president after 2016.

"(Jul 7, 2011  8:33 AM CDT) US stock futures are rising after two encouraging employment reports. The government said today that the number of Americans who made first-time claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 418,000 last week, slightly below estimates and the lowest figure in seven weeks. In a separate look at the labor market, private payroll processor Automatic Data Processing said companies added 157,000 employees in June. That's more than double the figure economists had forecast and far higher than the 36,000 added the previous month. The two reports come a day before the Labor Department releases its monthly look at employment. Economists estimate the unemployment rate will remain at 9.1% and that employers added only 90,000 jobs last month. Major retailers are also reporting June sales figures.

The uproar appeared to be over a Tibetan who disappeared after he escaped from police, the Xinhua agency said; a Tibetan exile said some 2,000 were involved in the protest. Some officials were  slightly injured  in the attack, Xinhua said, which the Tibetan said was sparked by the apparent suicide of a monk who was probed for unfurling the Tibetan flag.

About 19 million Iraqis are eligible to vote for who will lead the country after US forces pull out, in an election that will determine whether Iraq can overcome the jagged sectarian divisions that have defined it since the US-led invasion in 2003.  These acts will not undermine the will of the Iraqi people,  Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said this morning. Despite the violence and frustration that has set in after years of fighting and faulty government services, many Iraqis were still excited to vote.

Democrats facing elections this fall are breaking with the president, arguing that Obama's proposed $250,000 threshold is too low, Politico reports. Congressional Democrats have been focusing on raising taxes for those earning more than $1 million, and now some, like Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and North Dakota Senate candidate Heidi Heitkamp, say that's still the right move. The so-called  millionaire's tax,  Steny Hoyer explained, would  be a metaphor for how our Republican colleagues won't support increasing revenues on any person in America, no matter how much they make.  Virginia Senate candidate Tim Kaine, meanwhile, is pushing for a $500,000 threshold, which some are signing on to.

He said he decided on the move even though the weapon used to kill 17 students and school staff was not the one the shooter bought at Dick's. Stack also decided to stop selling guns to people under 21, a move that he estimates cost the company around $250 million.

And it said nearly all its policymakers foresee no rate hikes through 2022. The Fed has cut its benchmark short-term rate to near zero. Keeping its rate ultra-low for more than two more years could make it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend enough to sustain an economy depressed by still-widespread business shutdowns.

Renaud Prudhomme, 56—and weighing 260 pounds, per the Local—was helped home from Starter bar in Clermont-Ferrand last October after the drinking competition. Emergency services were called for Prudhomme soon after; he was taken to a hospital, where he died the next day of  a bronchial inhalation alcoholic coma,  Le Figaro reports, per the Huffington Post. Bartender Gilles Crepin, 47, admitted he shouldn't have posted the shots record, which perhaps pushed Prudhomme too far. A judge sentenced Crepin this week and banned him from working in a bar for a year. Crepin's lawyer, Renaud Portejoie, says he'll appeal, calling it  a decision guided by emotion and the unconscious desire to set an example.  Portejoie argued the brunt of the blame was on the victim's daughter, who encouraged her dad to beat the record, though he had existing respiratory and alcohol abuse problems, unbeknownst to Crepin.  We can't ask every customer who buys alcohol to present their medical certificates,  Portejoie says. A lawyer for Prudhomme's daughter says his client wasn't at the bar at the time of the competition and is  relieved by this decision.

The Telegraph reports that middle school and high school teachers there have been issued a manual to use while teaching a new subject for 2015:  Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities.  The manual contains details of Kim Jong Un's childhood—specifically, the amazing story of how he was driving by age 3, per YTN TV. It also notes that Kim is an awesome artist, pens musical scores, and was acing yachting races before puberty.  At the age of 9, Kim Jong Un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company who was visiting North Korea at the time,  one of the passages reportedly reads (he won that race  despite the odds,  per Metro). This inherent ability to win at life apparently runs in the family: The Telegraph brings up old claims that were made about Kim's father. Kim Jong Il supposedly walked at 3 weeks of age, talked at 8 weeks, wrote six operas, and penned 1,500 books during his three-year college tenure (take that, L. Ron Hubbard). But a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University thinks the new curriculum is less about genealogical bragging rights and more about panicked propaganda.

"(May 24, 2014  3:45 PM CDT) So about the hundreds of millions of tons of plastics we've been releasing into the oceans—it went where, exactly? According to a new study, much of it was trapped in Arctic ice and will be released as the ice melts, USA Today reports. At current melting rates, more than 1 trillion pieces of microplastic—like fibers, polymer beads, and fragments under 5 millimeters in length—will reach Earth's oceans over the next decade.  It was such a surprise to me to find them in such a remote region,  co-author Rachel Obbard tells Science.  These particles have come a long way.  Obbard and her colleagues based their figures on ice cores taken over two expeditions and analyzed under a microscope. What they found: 54% rayon (not technically a plastic, since it's wood-based, but it's still a  manmade semi-synthetic ), along with polyester (21%), nylon (16%), polypropylene (3%), and others in smaller amounts. So should we worry? Scientists don't know yet, but a California ecologist has studied how plastics can remain in the tissues of marine organisms and possibly release pollutants upon ingestion.  We’re starting to worry a bit more,  he says.",Melting Ice to Release 1T Pieces of Plastic
"(Jan 12, 2017  6:56 AM) The US military's investigation into a November firefight with the Taliban has shown that 33 civilians died in the raid during which American troops fired on Afghan homes, reports the AP. The inquiry followed claims that civilian deaths resulted from airstrikes called in to support Afghan and US forces who came under fire in the northern village of Buz-e Kandahari. Two senior Taliban figures, responsible for violence in Kunduz the previous month, were killed in the operation. According to a US military statement, the investigation  determined, regretfully, that 33 civilians were killed and 27 wounded  as troops responded to fire from  Taliban who were using civilian houses as firing positions.  After the raid, Kunduz residents carried more than a dozen corpses of the dead, including children and family members of the Taliban fighters, toward a local governor's office in a show of rage.  Regardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives,  said Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US Forces in Afghanistan. However, the US military statement added that its investigation  concluded that US forces acted in self-defense  in the joint Afghan-American raid in the village.

"(Jun 18, 2018  2:45 PM CDT) That Otto Warmbier's trouble began with an incident at the Yanggakdo Hotel in Pyongyang is well known, the details of it, less so. In front of North Korean reporters, the American confessed to  committ[ing] the crime of taking down a political slogan —said to be a propaganda poster— from the staff holding area  of the hotel. It would ultimately cost him his life. In a lengthy piece for the BBC by Megha Mohan, Calvin Sun recounts his own trip to Yanggakdo Hotel, and the  missing  5th floor, the floor that some say Warmbier  undoubtedly ventured onto,  writes Mohan. Sun's own trip happened after his first year of medical school, in 2011, when the American ended up there after taking a private tour of North Korea that departed from China. On his group's fifth and final night in Pyongyang, Sun says they were for the first time not supervised by their North Korean guides and decided to explore the 47-story hotel—and try to determine if there really was a fifth floor. The elevator has buttons for floors four and six, but not five, and some in the group had heard rumors about the quirk. And so they accessed a stairwell and found an unlocked, unguarded door that opened onto a floor whose ceiling height was significantly lower than that of the other floors. A corridor featured mostly locked doors, though an open one revealed a room that held what looked like hotel surveillance equipment. Among the propaganda posters was one that read,  This bomb is the product of the Americans. Every product of the Americans is our enemy. Get revenge a thousand hundred times against the Americans.

Police and witnesses say Charles Murphy, 56, jumped from a balcony at Sofitel New York Hotel in his business suit shortly before 5pm and died at the scene. Murphy's hedge fund at Fairfield Greenwich lost $50 million of the $7.5 billion it invested with Madoff, per DNA Info, and was subsequently sued by investors. Murphy had since been working at investment management firm Paulson & Co. It's unclear whether he personally lost money in Madoff's scam.

That's according to the publisher of Bob Woodward's second book about the Trump presidency, titled Rage. The personal letters  have not been public before,  says Simon & Schuster on the book's Amazon page.  Kim describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a 'fantasy film,' as the two leaders engage in an extraordinary diplomatic minuet.  Sources tell CNN that Woodward interviewed Trump more than a dozen times at Mar-a-Lago, the White House, and via phone, while conducting a slew of interviews with White House insiders and obtaining  notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents,  per the publisher. Woodward's first book about the Trump White House, Fear, didn't elicit a very positive response from the president—who called it  a piece of fiction  from a  liar  who used  phony sources,  the Guardian recalls. But Trump said in January that he had sat down with Woodward:  I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter,  he said on Fox News.  I can say Bob Woodward. He said he's doing something and this time I said, 'Maybe I'll sit down.'

Since a newspaper editorialized about salaries, benefits, and overtime pay that in at least two instances top $200,000 (with $400 for sun protection), a swell of anger from beachgoers and budget-watchers has blindsided the lifeguards. Only about half of that paycheck is salary, the rest is in the perks; after adding in overtime, special compensation, pension—Newport Beach's lifeguards can retire at 50 with 90% of their salary—medical benefits, and life insurance, even the lowest-paid officer made more than $98,000.

"(Mar 14, 2017  8:46 PM CDT) The Milgram experiment was a famous '60s study in which researchers tested subjects' obedience to authority by ostensibly having them administer electric shocks to unseen partners at the researchers' encouragement—a way to see why atrocities were carried out by Germans  just following orders  during the Holocaust. When people today hear about the experiment, they usually reject the idea that they'd be susceptible to carrying out cruel acts simply because they were told to, saying,  I would never behave in such a manner,  Tomasz Grzyb tells the Independent. But Grzyb, co-author of a recent study in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal, says the new experiment re-created the Milgram project, in Poland this time, and that nothing much has changed over the past 50 years: The obedience level was still high for modern-day subjects asked to carry out similarly shocking actions. For the recent trial, which couldn't exactly duplicate the original due to ethical concerns, 40 men and 40 women between the ages of 18 and 69 were placed before 10 buttons with increasing shock levels—and 90% of the subjects went all the way up to the highest level when asked, a press release notes. If participants believed a woman was receiving the shocks, they were less willing to go all the way, but the researchers say the sample size was too small to draw real conclusions from that. The scientists chose Poland as their locale because Milgram-style tests had never been carried out in Central Europe, where the authors found the question of rigid obedience to authority to be  exceptionally interesting,  they write. More than 50 years later,  a striking majority of subjects are still willing to electrocute a helpless individual,  Grzyb says in the release.

The Sacramento Bee reports Oregon wildlife biologists got a GPS-tracking collar on her in October 2017, and her  incredible journey  has been closely watched since. She entered California in late January 2018 and subsequently traveled around the state, touched part of Nevada, and twice returned to Oregon.

Jarosik's lawyer calls out the  hypocrisy  of Simmons, who has stepped down from his businesses, for his peace-promoting lifestyle.  Mr. Simmons … is a longtime vegan practicing nonviolence against animals. So basically he treats animals better than women,  Perry Wander said in a statement; the lawsuit references the  #TimesUp  movement several times. In a statement, Simmons says the  horrific accusations  have  shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual —words he's echoed in a previous statement refuting assault allegations against him.  I have enormous respect for the women's movement worldwide,  he adds.

"(Dec 12, 2020  6:00 AM) For 14 years, Virginia web designer David Oranchak has been toiling away on one of America's greatest mysteries: the  340 Cipher,  a 340-character puzzle sent to the San Francisco Chronicle more than 50 years ago by the infamous  Zodiac Killer,  who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late '60s. Finally, the breakthrough he's been looking for came this month, when he, Aussie mathematician Sam Blake, and Belgian programmer Jarl Van Eycke at long last broke the code that's mystified sleuths since it was sent to the Chronicle in 1969.  I feel vindicated,  Oranchak tells the Washington Post, admitting that when he first started examining the cipher in 2006, he was confident he'd figure it out almost immediately.  I thought, 'Oh, I can just write a computer program and solve it,' but it's been kicking my ass all this time,  he tells the Chronicle.  Until now.  Unfortunately, there's no name in the code, just this basic message:  I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. ... I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice [sic] all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me.  The breakthrough came on Dec. 3, when critical clues finally popped up in the usual mishmash of translated phrases, Oranchak says in a video on how they cracked the code. By Dec. 5, the team had solved the entire cipher and sent it to the FBI, which has since verified the breakthrough. The Zodiac Killer sent three other ciphers to newspapers: One was solved by a schoolteacher and his wife—that one read  I like killing because it is so much fun —and two more remain unsolved, one of which contained the killer's name, per the killer.  That's the one the code breakers have to work on now,  an ex-San Francisco cop who worked on the case tells the Chronicle.  We need his name.

"(Apr 26, 2016  10:11 AM CDT) The new Volkswagen: Mitsubishi? The car company announced Tuesday it has been cheating fuel tests in Japan for the past 25 years, an admission that caused shares to fall by 10% to a record low, reports CNNMoney. Mitsubishi's market value had already plunged last week with news that engineers from Nissan—Mitsubishi is a supplier to the fellow automaker—discovered that improper fuel-economy tests were used on four models: the eK Wagon, eK Space, Dayz, and Dayz Roox dating back to 2002, reports Reuters. Tuesday's revelation widens the scope of the problem. It isn't clear how many vehicles are affected, though no cars sold in the US are believed to be. Mitsubishi President Tetsuro Aikawa says he was unaware of the manipulation and the company is investigating who's responsible, reports Bloomberg.  I'm truly sorry that customers were led to buy vehicles based on incorrect fuel-efficiency ratings,  he said, per the New York Times.  All I can do is apologize.  The company said it's been using an unapproved method to measure deceleration, one that results in a too-rosy mileage rating. An industry expert says the unapproved tests may have been used on more than the four stated models, noting Mitsubishi has a  history of covering up faults.  In the 2000s, it was involved in  Japan's worst automotive recall scandal to date  after burying safety records and customer complaints, reports the Telegraph.",Mitsubishi Admits Cheating Fuel Tests Since 1991

Aside from the $700 billion bailout, Neil Barofsky says in testimony prepared for told Congress tomorrow, other trillion-dollar federal programs could balloon.  TARP has evolved into a program of unprecedented scope, scale and complexity,  Barofsky says.

It was a moment that really did, even though it's a cliche, [make us catch] our breath,  says neonatologist William Binder.  It really felt like a moment of awe.  Mom Chelsea Philips had no idea until her mom showed her a picture later.  He was kind of in a fetal position and you could see like his arms and his legs curled up,  she says.  It was actually really cool to see, and when I heard that was actually really rare, I was like, oh my gosh, you're a special little baby.  In fact, it's in just 1 in 80,000 births or so that the thin, tough membrane still covers part of a newborn's body, and it's typically the head, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. But being born  en caul,  as it's called, where the entire body is still surrounded by the sac (with the placenta providing oxygen), is a true medical rarity most OB-GYNs will never see. The doctor  was in awe when the baby just popped out completely enclosed,  per a Cedars-Sinai statement.  They had just a short amount of time to get the baby out of the sac and ... he had to puncture the sac with his fingers.

That's per an email sent by Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend., Ind., who, although a long shot for the Oval Office, would be the first openly gay US president if elected, the Wall Street Journal notes.  I am aware of the odds we would face if we proceed to mount a national campaign,  Buttigieg says in the email, which was supplemented Tuesday night by a video announcing his candidacy.  But I am exploring this run because I can offer a different experience and perspective than anyone else.

He and his husband, Chasten Glezman, married in June. Per the Atlantic, Buttigieg also addressed in his email the fact that he's a candidate on the young side—he's barely above the minimum age requirement of 35 to be president—and noted someone his age would be more likely to take things like climate change and the country's debt issues seriously, because he'll be around longer to face the consequences of such things.

"(Oct 26, 2018  10:50 AM CDT) Lauren McCluskey's killer was a master manipulator who penned messages under various names—even posed as a police officer—in an effort to lure and extort the 21-year-old University of Utah student before her death, according to police. Nine days before she was fatally shot on campus by an ex-boyfriend later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, McCluskey told university police she'd wired $1,000 to an account to prevent the release of  compromising  photos of her and the killer, 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, says University Police Chief Dale Brophy, per Fox News and ESPN. McCluskey had ended her relationship with the registered sex offender days earlier after discovering he'd lied about his background.  If his lips were moving, he was lying,  Brophy says of Rowland, who described himself as a manipulator of women at a 2012 parole hearing. Rowland told an acquaintance, for example, that he needed a gun because his girlfriend wanted to learn to shoot, reports CBS News. After shooting McCluskey multiple times in the backseat of a car he’d driven to campus, Rowland was picked up by a woman he'd met online. Before she recognized him as the murder suspect and called police, the pair went to dinner and back to the woman's apartment where Rowland showered before leaving, Brophy says. Meanwhile, the investigation into McCluskey's extortion complaint had been delayed by workload issues, and the Utah Department of Corrections had yet to be notified. Gov. Gary Herbert announced an investigation into the handling of the case on Thursday. Hindsight is 20/20, but  you never know when these things are going to occur,  he said.

He was hit with a $1,635.93 Uber fare after accidentally taking the ride service from near the West Virginia University campus, where he was partying with friends last Friday night, to his home in New Jersey, CBS Philadelphia reports.  We went to a frat party and then went to the bar. I was getting drinks all night; I probably spent like $200 at the bar after already drinking all day,  Bachman says.  Basically, I kinda just blacked out.  Needless to say, Bachman doesn't really remember calling himself an Uber. He says he woke up to the driver telling him they were about an hour away from New Jersey.  I was just like, that’s crazy. Why did you agree to take me to New Jersey from West Virginia?  Bachman says. Five hours and 300 miles after ordering the Uber, Bachman was home, the Washington Post reports. The ride would have been a good deal cheaper if Bachman hadn't drunkenly treated himself to a more expensive UberXL. According to NJ.com, surge pricing also doubled the cost. Bachman challenged the fare, arguing he would have told the driver to take him to his friends' place near the university campus—not all the way to New Jersey.  I know I wouldn't send it to my house,  Bachman says.  I knew where I was.  Uber states Bachman did indeed give the driver his home address, and Bachman agreed to pay the fare after the company contacted him.

Tishman Speyer, the property company that bought the 56-building, 11,000-unit Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town apartment complexes in Manhattan four years ago, is handing the debt-laden property over to creditors, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The dealership had even hired extra security in case people flooded the place, but when Tianna walked in, the streets and dealership appeared virtually empty. Confetti flew as the manager handed her the keys to the black car with the license plate  NOF00L  (pics are shown on the BMW Blog).

But there's a chance that the FDA is about to declare the chemical triclosan unsafe, in a review due to be completed this year. The germ-killer is one of a host of chemicals found in everyday American products that have never been approved by the FDA, and animal research indicates that it may increase the risk of infertility, early puberty, and other hormone problems, the AP reports.  To me it looks like the risks outweigh any benefit associated with these products right now,  one professor says. Triclosan was developed back before laws requiring FDA review of cleaning ingredients. But Congress specifically ordered the FDA to look into a number of common antibacterial chemicals, including triclosan, way back in 1972.

"(Aug 29, 2012  4:46 PM CDT) In the past year and a half, the federal government enforced tough new rules against banks and mortgage-lenders, designed to eliminate executives and mid-level employees with prior convictions for serious offenses such as fraud. But the banks, eager to avoid the $1-million-a-day fines, are firing even low-level workers over minor offenses, reports the Des Moines Register. The craziest example: A 68-year-old Vietnam veteran named Richard Eggers was canned from his $29,795-a-year customer service job at Wells Fargo. The reason? Forty-nine years ago, he used a cardboard dime at a laundromat and spent two days in jail. Another Wells Fargo employee, Yolanda Quesada, 58, was fired for a shoplifting offense from 40 years ago.  These guidelines are really meant for executives and people who can perpetuate widespread fraud,  says an attorney representing people who lost their jobs.  They’re not meant for low-level call center employees.  A Wells Fargo spokesperson explains:  We are operating in an environment where we’re facing new regulations and a heightened level of scrutiny on all our activities.  Eggers, though, calls it a  dirty trick.",Bank Fires Worker Over Minor Offense 49 Years Ago
"(Jan 23, 2018  9:00 AM) Four Japanese tourists were reportedly taken to the cleaners by a Venice restaurant, and now authorities are looking into the meal. ANSA reports the tourists ordered four steaks and a platter of grilled fish—no wine, just mineral water. The spot near St. Mark's Square reportedly charged them $1,350 for the meal; they paid the tab then filed a complaint Monday. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro pledged to get to the bottom of the matter:  If this shameful episode is confirmed, we’ll do all we can to punish those responsible. We are for justice, always!  he said, per the Guardian. But ANSA notes the story gets a little mushy, with other reports claiming the group ordered hearty  Fiorentine  cuts of beef, that the fish dish was sized to serve four, and that they drank aperitifs and pricey Amarone wine. A rep for the unnamed restaurant is said to have told local media that he had  no recollection of any problems with Japanese customers.  The BBC reports the four males are studying in Bologna, and complained upon their return to that city. It's a bit of a changed tune for Brugnaro, who the Local reported in November labeled a British family of three  cheapskates  for complaining over a $650 lunch they had in the same area; they alleged the restaurant took advantage of their inability to speak Italian and brought them pricey dishes they hadn't said they wanted.  What they paid was fair,  Brugnaro said.  If you come to Venice, you should know that you're Venice, you have to spend some money.  He added,  You should learn Italian, a bit of Venetian wouldn’t hurt either.  (This tourist died after a  foolish  move in Australia.)","Tourists Say They Ordered Steaks, Water, Got $1.4K Bill"

South Carolina will today announce that it’s holding its vote on Jan. 21, in an effort to put some distance between itself and Florida, a pair of GOP sources tell CNN.  Last Friday, a nine-person committee brought chaos to the 2012 calendar,  South Carolina GOP Chairman Chad Connelly said, referring to Florida.  Today, South Carolina is making things right.  The move is all but certain to push Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada’s dates even earlier.

Although Israel was widely believed to have been behind the Sept. 6, 2007, airstrike, it has never before commented publicly on it, the AP reports. In a lengthy release, the military revealed that eight F-15 fighter jets carried out the top-secret airstrikes against the facility in the Deir el-Zour region, about 300 miles northeast of Damascus, destroying a site that had been in development for years and was scheduled to go into operation at the end of that year.",Israel Confirms 2007 Strike on Syrian Nuclear Site
"(Sep 15, 2011  2:34 PM CDT) Netflix is taking its lumps today over its price hike and plan changes. After the company announced that it expects to have 1 million fewer US subscribers than projected at the end of the third quarter—24 million, instead of 25 million—its shares slid about 15%, reports MarketWatch. The big hit is in DVD-only customers: The company now expects to have 2.2 million of those, down from the projected 3 million. It also revised its projection for streaming-only customers down from 22 million to 21.8 million. Considering that Netflix had 24.59 million US customers at the end of the second quarter, this means that the pricing changes will result in a net loss of customers of about 500,000, notes Tim Carmody at Wired.  Netflix may have been premature here,  he adds.  It doesn’t own the streaming business, even in the US. Meanwhile, DVDs are hanging on much longer than anyone expected. Netflix had the right vision at the right time and built its tech at the right pace, but tossed its customers (and their wallets) into the deep end a little too soon.",Netflix Expects 1M Fewer Subscribers

McConnell, on the other hand, is unloved by conservatives and thus vulnerable.

"(Sep 7, 2014  5:30 PM CDT) Serena Williams ended a difficult-for-her Grand Slam season in the best way possible, winning her third consecutive US Open title by beating Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3 today. At the top of her game, Williams broke Wozniacki's serve five times and compiled a hard-to-believe 29-4 edge in winners. Remarkably, until a cross-court backhand on the run in the final game that even Williams applauded, the only winners registered by the 10th-seeded Wozniacki came on a trio of aces, one in the first set, two in the second. That was, in part, a result of the Dane's iffy play in only her second Grand Slam final—she lost to Kim Clijsters at the 2009 US Open—but more due to Williams' relentless pursuit of every ball. Williams has now equaled Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova with 18 major singles titles, the fourth-most in history. Williams also matched Evert's total of six championships at the US Open and became the first woman to win three in a row since Evert's four-title run from 1975-78. Williams earned $4 million, a record in tennis—$3 million for the title, plus a $1 million bonus for having had the best results during the North American summer hard-court circuit. It was a dominant performance to cap a dominant two weeks in Flushing Meadows. Not only did Williams, ranked and seeded No. 1, win all 14 sets she played in the tournament, she never even dropped more than three games in any of them.",Serena Williams Wins 3rd Straight US Open

Reserve Deputy Bob Bates, a 73-year-old insurance executive, told police he thought he was reaching for his Taser when he shot Eric Harris in Tulsa, Okla., on April 2, the Guardian reports.  I shot him. I'm sorry,  the deputy says on the police body-camera video after Harris, 44, is shot. Harris can be heard saying,  He shot me, man. Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath,  to which an officer responds:  f--- your breath.  Police say Harris, who died at the hospital less than an hour later, had been seen  reaching for his waistband area  as he fled after selling a gun to an undercover officer, reports the Tulsa World.  It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment,  Bates tells the World, which notes that he has been a reserve deputy since 2008—and was chairman of the sheriff's re-election campaign, to which he donated $2,500. In a statement, Harris' family calls for an independent investigation and accuses Bates of being a  pay to play  cop.  We do not believe it is reasonable for a 73-year-old insurance executive to be involved in a dangerous undercover sting operation,  they say. A police spokesman tells the Los Angeles Times that Bates has also donated equipment, including  a couple cars,  to the force, but he  isn't the only millionaire we've got  in the reserve program and it's not true that he  bought his way  into it.","Cops: Deputy, 73, Shot Man Dead 'by Mistake'"

"(Nov 14, 2017  4:21 PM) Is a 13-year-old girl old enough to agree to sex with an adult? That's a question France is asking itself as the government prepares to set a legal age for sexual consent for the first time, the AP reports. Twice in recent weeks, French courts refused to prosecute grown men for rape after they had sex with 11-year-olds because authorities couldn't prove coercion. Amid public horror, the government is drafting a bill to say sex with children under a certain age is by definition coercive. Feminist groups plan a protest Tuesday to argue the age should be set at 15. Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet says 13  is worth considering.  The age is just one piece of an upcoming bill on sexual violence and harassment. As France24 explains, it is illegal in France to have sex with someone younger than 15, but it's only considered sexual abuse. Prosecutors must be able to prove a lack of consent in order for it to be considered rape—because there is no minimum age under which, by law, a child is considered to be legally unable to give consent. One of the men referenced above, for example, was tried for sexual abuse instead of rape due to France's current legal definition of rape, PBS NewsHour reports.  The law will mean that 'below a certain age, there can be no debate, ever, on the sexual consent of a child, and that any child below a certain age would automatically be considered as raped or sexually assaulted,'  the country's equalities minister explains, per the Local.","After Shocking Cases Involving 11-Year-Olds, France to Set Age of Consent"

Take, for instance, the bust of Walker that was unveiled with much fanfare in 1977. Turns out, the bust's visage is based on a portrait of a different John Walker (an actor who never set foot in Stockton), ITV News reports. Though the error was discovered in 1993 after the National Portrait Gallery weighed in, it resurfaced recently during a meeting when a city council member asked a city official why the statue is  hidden  away in a local shopping center.  I can reveal that the bust of John Walker was inaccurately produced. It is the bust of another John Walker,  the official answered. Walker—the right one—invented the friction match in 1826, accidentally discovering that a chemical-coated stick caught fire when dragged along his hearth, reports the BBC. The chemist never patented the invention,  perhaps hoping it would be used for the public good.  Stockton has a long history of misguided attempts at honoring Walker: A brass plaque installed in 1893 misidentified Walker as the inventor of the Lucifer match—an imitation that came to market in 1829. A plastic match sculpture that went up in 2001 was subsequently removed because nobody liked it.

Austin, now 20, described a litany of alleged abuse: being hit with a can opener, having the tip of his penis burned with a cigarette, and being forced to take ice baths and eat cockroaches, reports WBIR. Having their hands cuffed behind their backs and attached to a kitchen cabinet was routine for the brothers, then 16 and 14, Austin claimed. In a move the News Sentinel calls  creative,  prosecutors brought into the courtroom the cabinets the boys were allegedly handcuffed to in their Knoxville trailer. Early one morning in May 2013, the boys say they freed themselves from the cabinets while their father and stepmother slept and walked to Farragut High School. There they found a friend in janitor Richard Huff.  Both of their hands were swollen probably twice the size of what's normal,  Huff testified Monday.  I've never seen anything like that.  Although the boys begged him not to tell, Huff called police. Dad Michael McIntosh, a former cop, was also arrested; the News Sentinel reports he saw his boys as problem children, and accused Austin of harming animals and sexually abusing boys. Michael McIntosh will testify against Cox Wednesday as part of a plea deal. Cox's attorney counters that McIntosh was the abuser and that Cox was a victim as well. The brothers now live with their grandparents; Cox's three biological children were not abused.",Son Alleges Stepmom Spent 5 Months 'Dehumanizing' Him

He said the alliance launched the airstrike late yesterday in retaliation for an attack earlier in the day on a US Marine base. A NATO spokesman said a joint coalition and Afghan delegation was traveling to the site to investigate. Afghan President Karzai blamed American troops for airstrikes that killed the 14 women and children and two men, injuring of six other civilians.  We have told the Americans and NATO forces several times that uncoordinated operations will result in the killing of innocent civilians and that such operations are inhumane, but still no one has listened,  Karzai said today, adding that his condemnation would be  the last warning to NATO forces, American forces, and American officials.",Afghan Officials: NATO Airstrike Killed 12 Children
"(Feb 8, 2015  3:13 PM) A riot broke out today outside of a major soccer game in Egypt, with fighting between police and fans killing at least 20 people, security officials said. The riot, only three years after similar violence killed 74 people, began ahead of a match between Egyptian Premier League clubs Zamalek and ENPPI at Air Defense Stadium east of Cairo. Such attacks in the past have sparked days of violent protests pitting the country's hard-core fans against police officers in a nation already on edge after years of revolt and turmoil. Three security officials said some people died during a stampede, while others died in clashes with police. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists. What caused the violence wasn't immediately clear. Security officials said Zamalek fans tried to force their way into the match without tickets, sparking clashes. Zamalek fans, known as  White Knights,  posted on their group's official Facebook page that the violence began because authorities only opened one narrow, barbed-wire door to let them in. They said that sparked pushing and shoving that later saw police officers fire tear gas and birdshot. The group later posted pictures on Facebook it claimed were of dead fans, including the names of 22 people it said had been killed.

"(Nov 30, 2015  9:48 AM) Japan is wasting little time in resuming its  scientific  whale hunte: Its whaling fleet will leave Tuesday for the Antarctic for a three-month, scaled-down hunt, the government says, despite protests. Monday's announcement comes days after Japan submitted its final plan to the International Whaling Commission after the commission's scientific committee said earlier this year it wasn't convinced that whales needed to be killed for research on whale stock management and conservation. Japan says lethal sampling is indispensable to obtain data on the maturing ages of whales. The IWC imposed a commercial ban on whaling in 1986, but Japan has continued to kill whales under a research exemption. This will be the first expedition since the International Court of Justice ruled last year that they weren't truly scientific, forcing Tokyo to revise its Antarctic whaling plans. Last year, Japan did go to the Antarctic, but didn't kill any whales. Japan's actual catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat; protests by anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd have also contributed. Tokyo plans to catch up to 333 minke whales each year over the next 12 years, about one-third of what it used to, the Fisheries Agency and the Foreign Ministry said Monday. The plan will be evaluated after six years. Fifteen environmental and animal rights groups say in a statement that Tokyo should stop using taxpayer money to keep the debt-ridden whaling operation alive.  We strongly demand that the government not start any new research whaling programs, and instead take on new measures that contribute to ocean conservation,  they say. Australia, which brought the ICJ case against Japan, said it might send a boat to shadow the Japanese fleet.",Japan to Begin 3-Month Antarctic Whale Hunt

The men were shot during a brawl that broke out at the club in an upscale part of the capital around 4:25am, police sources tell Reuters. One embassy worker was shot in the leg; the other was shot in the stomach but didn't notice the injury until he arrived home, according to the police report. The two men are members of the support staff in the office of the defense attaché, but there does not appear to have been a political motive behind the shootings, a State Department official tells the New York Times. A soaring murder rate has made the Venezuelan capital one of the most dangerous cities in the world, although the part of town where the men were shot was not off-limits to embassy personnel.

But instead of stick figures, Iris Grace immersed herself in abstract impressionist painting for hours at a time, often depicting movement in nature such as water, trees, wind, birds, and of course her cat, Thula. Now 5, Iris Grace is already selling her paintings for thousands of dollars a print, with art collectors and galleries gushing over the vibrancy and openness of her work, reports the Independent.  She is so interested in movement and how it changes things,  her mother tells the paper, noting her daughter has received  a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style.  It all started simply enough, with her parents opting to share their daughter's early works online. Now Iris Grace has more than 95,000 likes on Facebook, and the proceeds from her art help fund her art supplies and private therapy for her disorder, which made it difficult for her to speak until recently. Meanwhile, her mother tells ABC News they have to shield their daughter from all the attention and keep her schedule as stable and routine as possible.

But all told, that means we'll be dropping an estimated $703 million to show our furry friends that Cupid's arrow hath struck.

Though Virani had hoped the court would order the hospital to stop feeding Shanbaug, it instead sided with hospital bosses, who argued Shanbaug  accepts food ... and responds by facial expressions.  But the BBC notes the case did lead to a loosening of  some restrictions on euthanasia.  A terminally ill patient in India can now be taken off life support in exceptional circumstances if family members want that to happen. (The Wall Street Journal explains that because Shanbaug's parents were dead, the hospital was considered her caregiver, hence the court siding with it.) Her attacker, Sohanlal Bharta Walmiki, served seven years for attempted murder and robbery but was never charged with rape because sodomy wasn't mentioned in India's rape laws.  Perhaps she is paying for what she did in her last life,  a nurse says in Virani's book, Aruna's Story, per Firstpost.  Perhaps, like your Jesus Christ, she is paying for all our sins.",Raped Nurse Dies After 42 Years in Coma
"(Jul 25, 2011  3:13 PM CDT) With unemployment levels high and the US on the brink of default, is it any surprise that American pessimism has reached a 15-year high? A new CNN poll cited by Politico finds that 59% expect the economy to be in bad shape a year from now, the highest percentage since CNN started asking that question in 1997. Of those surveyed, 40% expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now, but only 4% of those believe it will be in  very  good shape. The only other time such pessimism has reached the halfway mark or worse was in September 2005, when 50% said they feared poor economic conditions by the following year. And even some of those who are optimistic admit the economy isn't doing so well at the moment: 84% say the current economy is in poor condition, while 16% believe it's in good condition.

"(Jan 16, 2009  5:14 AM) The pilot of US Airways Flight 1549 is being praised for pulling off one of the rarest and most challenging maneuvers in aviation, the Wall Street Journal reports. Chesley Sullenberger is the first pilot in over 50 years to land a jetliner on water without a single fatality, and he managed to do so while coping with multiple other challenges. Pilots receive bare bones training about landing on water, and it's generally believed that such landings will almost inevitably result in fatalities as a wing or engine catches the water and causes the plane to flip or break up.  The fact that passengers were able to walk off that airplane and wait on the wing for rescuers to arrive is remarkable,  said an aviation consultant and former pilot.

I just think it's ridiculous,  says Jacqueline Ades.  I can't believe that it turned into this. I can't believe that I'm actually in jail over some text messages.  Ades was arrested in April 2018 and charged with stalking and criminal trespassing after police say they found her bathing in the man's Paradise Valley house. She had met him on the millionaire dating website Luxy, gone out once, and deluged him with texts including threats to eat his organs and wear his flesh. But in a jailhouse interview, she dismissed the texts as  these weird things.   Just, like, I was literally playing with my imagination and it turned out that that scared him,  she tells the Arizona Republic. In March, two out of three mental-health experts deemed her mentally restorable but unable to stand trial, so the trial was delayed by at least 60 days while psychologists work on her. She was offered a plea deal that would have given her freedom with time served and 10 years' probation, but Ades says she didn't think it was real. She also claims Walt Disney is an Illuminati member who flies a spaceship and abducted her. Now she hopes a trial will lead to her eventual marriage to the man she met online.

"(Jan 20, 2015  6:30 AM) For some 44 years, British tabloid the Sun has featured topless female models on its third page in a controversial tradition known as the  Page 3 girls.  But no more: Though the Sun itself has not confirmed the change, another newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, the Times, reports that Friday's edition was the last to feature the  bare-breasted  photos. This week, the tabloid has still featured photos of scantily clad women there (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in lingerie yesterday; two actresses in bikinis today), but their breasts are covered up. Activists had been railing against the  Page 3 girls  feature in recent years, calling it sexist, AFP reports. According to the Times, Murdoch himself called the tradition  old-fashioned  last year and a change has been in the works ever since. Even so, it was just after Murdoch bought the Sun that the tradition began, back in 1970 with German model Stephanie Rahn. Since then, models like Samantha Fox and Katie Price have seen their careers launched by the page. But the Sun's PR head insists to AFP that there's no official confirmation from the tabloid that the tradition is definitively over, and AFP also notes that in today's edition, readers were informed they could see topless photos online instead (the Guardian notes that viewers are being directed to Page3.com). Lucy-Anne Holmes, the actress who started the No More Page 3 campaign in 2012, wasn't exactly effusive in her praise of the move:  The Sun hasn't suddenly decided that women say, think, and do interesting and incredible things,  she tells the BBC.

Cynthia Stafford, a Democrat, has introduced a bill to scrap a law that allows people 15 or younger to marry if they have a baby or are expecting one, the Sun-Sentinel reports.  Marriage is an adult responsibility,  she says.  We don't want them to vote, we don't want them to drink alcohol, they can't drive a car, and we allow them to marry under 16.   You may say, 'this does not happen nowadays,' but in 2012 we had a 13-year-old groom in the state of Florida,  Stafford told a House subcommittee. State records show that there were 110 marriages of children 16 and younger in the state last year, though the statistics don't reveal how many of them were 15 or younger. The bill would still allow 16- and 17-year-olds to marry with parental consent. If it becomes law, Florida will join Alabama, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont, and Wisconsin in banning under-16 marriages under all circumstances.",Florida Moves to Ban Under-16 Marriages
"(Apr 23, 2017  1:09 PM CDT) President Trump is proving as polarizing and vexing as candidate Trump once did: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that while Trump remains a deeply unpopular president, the people who voted for him are sticking by him. The current inhabitant of the Oval Office has a 42% approval rating among all Americans, and the Post has to go back to Dwight Eisenhower to find another president with a lower such rating at this point in the game. His disapproval numbers are also stratospheric at 59%; the previous high was Bill Clinton, who also had a bruising first 100 days, at 39%. The Post notes that Trump's predecessor's approval rating was 69% at this stage, disapproval at 26%. Fox News, though, finds the silver lining, with a staggering 96% of people who voted for Trump saying they'd do it again, while only 2% said they'd change their minds. And the president's approval rating is starkly different among Trump voters (94% like the job he's doing) and among Republicans (84%). Trump also beats Clinton's start in the percentage who say he's gotten either a great deal or a good amount done: 42% to 37%, respectively. And Trump again edges Clinton among those who feel campaign promises are being kept, 44% to 42%. Another chink in Trump's armor: Only 38% of respondents said he was honest, compared to 74% for Obama and 62% for George W. Bush. The complete poll is here.

While the what is unknown, the how long is clear: 718 days in orbit, reports Space.com, with the unmanned plane landing Sunday morning at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida—and flying into the record books. It was the Air Force's fourth such mission since April 2010 and the longest to date. A fifth is planned for 2017, reports Reuters. There's plenty of speculation about what the 29-foot-long plane, which looks like a mini-space shuttle, is up to up there. Reuters cites one group's belief that the secrecy indicates intelligence-related hardware tests are being conducted. An Air Force fact sheet offers up this much:  The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold; reusable spacecraft technologies for America’s future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth.  One cool fact: Though its mission is classified, its location isn't, thanks to what Space.com refers to as  keen-eyed amateur astronomers.  The site offers a satellite tracker when missions are active, and notes the X-37B  usually looks like a star of middling brightness moving across the sky.",Plane Ends 2 Secretive Years in Space

Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt  sick to my stomach  when she heard about those purchases.  I don't know what he's done to her,  she says.  I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.  Authorities believe Carlie is in  imminent danger.  Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth.  This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,  a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction.

Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, who traveled to Kiev to retrieve the paintings—which included works by Rubens, Tintoretto, and Mantegna—said the possibility of ever recovering them once seemed remote, the AP reports. Still, the paintings returned with little more than scratches after their long ordeal.  The works are all returning to Verona intact,  Franceschini said.  It was an ugly story that became a beautiful story.  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko handed over the paintings to Franceschini in a ceremony in Kiev, saying  the theft of masterpiece paintings is akin to stealing part of the city's heart.  The paintings, wrapped in plastic bags, were recovered in May by Ukrainian border guards who intercepted them on a small island on the Dniester River during an attempt to smuggle them into Moldova. They were stolen in November 2015 when three armed robbers entered the Castelvecchio Museum, located in a medieval castle, at closing time just before the alarm system was activated. The robbers calmly removed the paintings before escaping in a security guard's car. A guard at the museum, Pasquale Silvestri Riccardi, was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison earlier this month. Five others were also convicted, including Riccardi's Moldovan girlfriend, who received six years, and his twin brother, who was sentenced to eight months.",17 Stolen Masterpieces Returned Year After Heist

A new study examining decades of data has found that life expectancy in southern China is 5.5 years longer than in northern China, and the difference is almost entirely the result of heart and lung diseases caused by particulate pollution from burning coal, reports the Los Angeles Times. The researchers estimate that the air pollution cut a staggering 2.5 billion years off the lives of the 500 million residents of northern China.  It's a huge loss. Air pollution in China is really damaging people's health much more seriously than the findings in previous literature  would suggest, says one of the study's authors.  After this study, there should be no argument over whether we should take the air pollution issue seriously.

We do have good people,  he said,  but the direction has to be clear and you've got to hold people accountable.  Zinke's comments echo complaints by some White House allies that a permanent  deep state  in Washington has sabotaged Trump's efforts to remake the government. Zinke didn't go that far, but he noted:  There's too many ways in the present process for someone who doesn't want to get (a regulatory action) done to put it a holding pattern.  To remedy that, Zinke said he's pursuing a major reorg to push much of the agency's decision-making outside DC, moving several agencies to undetermined Western states. Besides moving employees, Zinke noted he wants to speed up permits for oil drilling, logging, and other energy development that now can take years.

Though it's unclear why the train was going so fast, according to the Guardian. The AP reports there is no indication the crash had anything to do with the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday.

"(Apr 30, 2012  10:50 AM CDT) Thousands of small drones could take wing across the US following a Federal Aviation Administration decision next month. Police departments have been snapping up the unmanned aircraft, whose cameras could be used for everything from missing-person searches to catching drug dealers. Now law enforcement is waiting on the FAA to lay out rules for using the drones—guidelines that must be set by May 14 under a February law signed by President Obama. The FAA must rule on how far and high the drones will be allowed to go, as well as who will be eligible to launch them. While backers cite a  public interest  in getting the drones off the ground as soon as possible, civil rights groups worry about invasive domestic surveillance and safety advocates say that ramming the guidelines through in the next two weeks will endanger other aircraft. Though the May 14 decision will apply only to police and first-responder drones weighing less than 4.4 pounds, the gadgets could someday be used for more mundane tasks like selling real estate and dusting crops, the Los Angeles Times notes.",Due in 2 Weeks: FAA Rules for Drones in US Skies
"(May 5, 2014  10:06 AM CDT) A second man is suing Bryan Singer for alleged sexual assault. John Doe No. 117 is represented by the same lawyer working for the first alleged victim, and the charges are similar: The alleged victim says he was 17 when he was introduced to the X-Men director at an after-party for Singer's London Superman film premiere; Singer offered him a Quaalude and Doe turned it down. The suit then claims that at an after-after-party in a hotel suite, Singer and Broadway producer Gary Goddard (who was also named in the first lawsuit) grabbed him sexually even after he asked them to stop. Doe says a third man smacked him around and then Singer tried to rape him. The suit also accuses Goddard of inappropriate acts when Doe was 15 or 16, including once plying Doe with alcohol and allegedly having anal sex with him. Singer and Goddard both deny the allegations, the Daily Beast reports. Interestingly, the age of consent in England is 16, but as the Hollywood Reporter explains, the lawsuit says California's age of consent (18) should apply since Singer and Goddard made their sexual plans while still in California. It also argues that the federal age of consent (also 18) applies to  travel from the US for sexual purposes.  Singer still has not been formally served with either of the two lawsuits.",Bryan Singer Hit With 2nd Teen Sex Assault Suit
"(Mar 9, 2016  12:38 PM) Bernie Sanders' campaign has filed a suit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, accusing him of unlawfully trying to keep 17-year-olds from voting in Tuesday's primary, CNN reports.  The secretary of state has decided to disenfranchise people who are 17 but will be 18 by the day of the general election,  says Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. Husted, for his part, says he's  very happy to be sued on this issue because the law is crystal clear,  per the Hill. Though maybe not as clear as he thinks: Per the Columbus Dispatch, Husted is citing the 2015 election manual, which says eligible 17-year-olds can nominate candidates for office—so other primary races, such as those for the US Senate and state legislative positions, are fair game—but they can't elect candidates for office (and in the Ohio presidential primary, voters are technically electing delegates to nominate for them). But Democratic state Rep. Kathleen Clyde says there's no precedence for Husted's interpretation, and the Dispatch points out Ohio's Revised Code, which says  every qualified elector who is or will be on the day of the next general election eighteen or more years of age ... shall be entitled to vote ... at the primary election,  with no mentioned exception for presidential primaries. The Sanders' campaign also brings up in its suit a 2009 pamphlet put out by Ohio's then-secretary of state that clearly shows eligible 17-year-olds can vote in the presidential primary, but not for  one-time questions on issues like school levies or statewide ballot issues  or for  election of state or county central committee persons.  Sanders calls the block  unconstitutional  and adds  it is an outrage that [Husted] … is going out of his way to keep young people—significantly African-American young people, Latino young people—from participating.

"(Sep 6, 2019  2:08 AM CDT) Robert Mugabe has died thousands of miles away from the country he ruled for nearly 40 years. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe's successor as president of Zimbabwe, says the former leader has died at the age of 95. In a tweet, Mnangagwa described Mugabe as an  icon of liberation  and the country's  founding father.  Sources tell Reuters that Mugabe died in Singapore, where he had been in a hospital since April. Mugabe, born in what was then Rhodesia in 1924, was imprisoned for a decade without trial after criticizing the country's government in 1964. After a long and bitter guerrilla war, he became the country's first leader after the end of white minority rule and promised reconciliation.  But the hope that accompanied independence in 1980 dissolved into violence, corruption, and economic disaster,  a BBC obituary notes. Mugabe was prime minister until 1987, when he abolished the office and became president instead, an office he held until he was ousted in 2017. In the 1980s, he presided over a period of economic expansion—but also crushed opposition with a campaign of ethnic cleansing believed to have killed 20,000 people in Matabeleland. After rigged elections in 1999, the increasingly authoritarian Mugabe began seizing land from white farmers as part of a land reform program that contribution to hyperinflation and the crumbling of the economy, the Guardian reports. Amid increased repression, hundreds died in political violence.  He'll be remembered as a villain,  says John Makumbe, a politics professor at the University of Zimbabwe.

"(Oct 27, 2011  4:43 AM CDT) Five years after a bat-killing plague was discovered in the eastern United States, and three years after a fungus was linked to that plague, scientists have finally identified the pathogen and confirmed it is indeed responsible for the deaths, reports Reuters. The deadly white fungus  Geomyces destructans  is responsible for white-nose syndrome, which has killed about 1 million bats since 2006, wiping out more than 90% of some species of cave-dwelling bats. Geomyces destructans  hits bats while they hibernate, causing them to use their limited body fat reserves and exhibit strange behavior, such as flying deep into caves where they cannot find insects to eat or outside during the day. As the fungus spreads westward, wildlife experts worry about the potential effects the loss of insect-eating bat populations might have, with one study estimating the flying mammal is worth $3.7 billion a year.",Scientists Identify Fungus That Has Killed 1M Bats
"(Feb 20, 2013  3:03 AM) Fatal drug overdoses rose for the 11th straight year, federal data show, and most of them were accidents involving addictive painkillers despite growing attention to their risks.  The big picture is that this is a big problem that has gotten much worse quickly,  said Dr. Thomas Frieden, head of the CDC. In 2010, the CDC reported, there were 38,329 drug overdose deaths nationwide. Medicines, mostly prescription drugs, were involved in nearly 60% of overdose deaths that year, overshadowing deaths from illicit narcotics. As in previous recent years, opioid drugs—which include OxyContin and Vicodin—were the biggest problem, contributing to three of four medication overdose deaths. Frieden said many doctors and patients don't realize how addictive these drugs can be, and that they're too often prescribed for pain that can be managed with less risky drugs. They're useful for cancer,  but if you've got terrible back pain or terrible migraines,  using these addictive drugs can be dangerous, he said. Anti-anxiety drugs including Valium were among common causes of medication-related deaths, involved in almost 30% of them.",Fatal Drug ODs Rise 11th Straight Year

They made their find using laser sensors known as Lidar, which outlined the city, called Mahendraparvata.  With this instrument—bang—all of a sudden we saw an immediate picture of an entire city that no one knew existed,  one of the archaeologists tells the Age. Atop a mountain, Mahendraparvata belonged to the Khmer Empire of southeast Asia, which dates between 800 and 1400 AD, NPR notes. Researchers then made their way to the site itself, using the Lidar data to navigate—along with help from an ex-Khmer Rouge soldier who lost a leg to landmines.

"(Sep 24, 2019  8:21 AM CDT) He was, writes Dina Temple-Raston of NPR, once one of the most famous hackers in all the world. That was back in the early 2000s when Adrian Lamo made a name for himself hacking into corporate websites—not for financial gain but to expose weaknesses. He even ended up with a felony conviction after infiltrating the New York Times' computers. But Lamo truly became famous as the person who turned in Chelsea Manning to government authorities. He went from being hailed as a hero among hackers to vilified as a snitch. His life went into a downward spiral, culminating in his death last year at 37 in, of all places, a senior living facility in Kansas. The cause of death remains officially undetermined, adding only more mystery (and conspiracy theories) to Lamo's story. Temple-Raston unpacks all this and takes an educated guess at what happened. By 2018, Lamo had been using drugs heavily. He was in the senior living facility because the parents of a friend got him in there; as it turns out, anyone with a low income qualified, and Lamo had no job. Hours before he died, Lamo left a voice note to himself speaking of  agonizing pain  because he had twisted his leg. Temple-Raston's theory:  After spending some time on the computer and having dinner he took something to help him relax and maybe ease some of that muscle pain,  she writes.  He went into the bedroom, lay down on the clothes, curled up, and just stopped breathing. It wasn't natural, suicide, homicide or completely undetermined—it was an accident.

"(Sep 7, 2019  7:30 AM CDT) The three-car crash Wednesday in New Mexico that took the life of country singer Kylie Rae Harris and a teen girl was caused by Harris herself. That's per the Taos County Sheriff's Office, which says that excessive speed appeared to be a contributing factor, and that alcohol may have also played a role in the crash that killed the 30-year-old performer and 16-year-old Maria Elena Cruz, the Tennessean reports.  At this time I will say with most certainty that Miss Cruz was an innocent victim of this senseless crash caused by Ms. Harris,  Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe says. Per the Taos News, investigators say Harris was driving on State Road 522 when she clipped another car, which sent her own vehicle into oncoming traffic. That's when her car struck a Jeep driven by Cruz. Both Harris and Cruz died at the scene; the third driver escaped injury. The News cites court records showing Harris had a 2017 DWI conviction in Collin County, Texas, after which she was ordered by the court to install an ignition interlock device in her car to prevent her from driving while intoxicated. Although Harris' mother tells People that her daughter had driven  11 or 12 hours that day  and was likely  exhausted,  she also notes alcohol is  something [Kylie] struggled with on and off over the years.  Hogrefe tells Yahoo Entertainment that because Harris died in the crash and there's no rush to press criminal charges, the toxicology report could take  several months up to a year.

A few weeks ago, he underwent transplant surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, which agreed to treat him after his parents searched the country for a willing hospital.

"(Sep 5, 2011  6:38 AM CDT) If you want to visit someone in prison in Arizona, it's going to cost you $25, in a one-time  background check fee  believed to be the first of its kind in the United States, reports the New York Times. But prisoner advocacy groups call the fee  mind-boggling,  saying that such a fee could ultimately increase crime rates.  We know that one of the best things you can do if you want people to go straight and lead a law-abiding life when they get out of prison is to continue family contact while they’re in prison,  said a prison expert at the ACLU.  Talk about penny-wise and pound-foolish.  The fee was designed in part to offset prison costs, as Arizona faced a $1.6 billion deficit at the start of the year, and the Department of Corrections was not getting the $150 million it said it needed for building maintenance to keep the prison system safe and operating properly. But critics say the fee is a bad idea, born  out of sheer financial desperation.   This was a scheme—in my mind, a harebrained scheme—to try to come up with the money,  said a retired judge who is now the leader of a prison reform group.",Arizona Charges $25 to Visit Prisoners

"(Nov 12, 2018  1:21 AM) When it is impossible to escape from an attacking black bear, the National Park Service advises hitting the animal in the face—and it was a strategy that may have saved the life of North Carolina man Sonny Pumphrey. The 78-year-old says he was in his driveway when a mother bear and two cubs showed up, CTV reports. He says the cubs ran off, but the mother reared up and then charged him.  She made a charging dead run at me. That sucker was eyeball-to-eyeball to me,  the Haywood County man tells WLOS. He says he  hit her right dead on the point of the nose the first shot,  but when he did, the bear dropped down and started trying to bite him on the hip. Pumphrey says he kept hitting the bear and she kept trying to bite him.  She got a hold of me and then shook me a little bit, then she let go and she took a swat at me,  he says.  And when she took a swat at me she knocked me about eight feet over on the concrete.  The bear ran off when Pumphrey's wife, Betty, and their Yorkshire terrier heard the noise and came outside to investigate. Pumphrey survived without serious injury, though he received a bite to the hip and will need to have rabies shots.  We have a lot to be thankful for because we were both very, very lucky,  Betty Pumphrey says.

"(Nov 20, 2014  10:04 PM) Five prisoners have been released from Guantanamo Bay as part of a renewed effort to close the detention center, officials say. Three men were sent to Georgia and two to Slovakia for resettlement. They were among dozens of low-level prisoners at Guantanamo that an administration task force in 2009 deemed to no longer pose a threat. The release of the men, four Yemenis and a Tunisian, brings the prison population to 143, around 100 fewer than when President Obama took office vowing to close the center. Obama's vow to close Guantanamo was thwarted by Congress, which prohibited sending any prisoner to the US and imposed restrictions that brought releases to a halt. Congress eased the transfer restrictions last December, and releases have resumed. A number of resettlements are expected in the coming weeks. US State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners, and he praises Georgia and Slovakia.  We are very grateful to our partners for these generous humanitarian gestures,  he says.

"(Oct 25, 2016  3:19 PM CDT) A mysterious plane crash in nearly inaccessible terrain. A foreign government fails to investigate thoroughly. Missing black boxes. No bodies or blood. An airline that was later implicated in large-scale cocaine smuggling, then went bankrupt. And... a bunch of crocodile skins? These are the mysteries that drew Americans Dan Futrell and Isaac Stoner to the decades-old case of Eastern Airlines Flight 980, which crashed into the side of a Bolivian mountain on New Year's Day in 1985. With journalist Peter Frick-Wright in tow, the pair hopped a plane to South America to see if they could locate the black box flight recorders, which were never found. Surprisingly, they did find both—in pieces. The full tale, published at Outside, turns out to be more fascinating than they could have ever predicted. Eastern Airlines Flight 980 went down on its stormy approach to La Paz, Bolivia, killing all aboard. The flight, operated by now-defunct Eastern Airlines, originated in Paraguay. Due to a number of factors, the crash site was never satisfactorily investigated by Bolivian or US authorities. The families of the 29 passengers were left in limbo, and conspiracy theorists quickly began whispering about dark dealings involving the Bolivian government, Ronald Reagan's White House, and the Paraguayan mafia. And as it turns out, Futrell, Stoner, and Frick-Wright didn't really have all that much trouble accessing the site, where debris from the crash is slowly sliding down the mountain. They even brought back the black box fragments, as well as the tape, which now sit in Futrell and Stoner's kitchen in legal limbo. So why all the secrecy? As the Bolivian government and the US government aren't on great terms at the moment, it may be a while before we can find out. Until then, Frick-Wright's story is excellent.",The Deepening Mystery of Eastern Airlines Flight 980
"(Jan 24, 2011  6:48 AM) Taxpayers have spent more than $160 million defending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in fraud lawsuits since the government took over the companies in 2008. The closely guarded cost was released last week after Rep. Randy Neugebauer requested the figures last year. Some $132 million of the total went to defend Fannie Mae, mostly over lawsuits and accounting probes that occurred before the subprime crisis; $24.2 million was spent on the defense of three of the mortgage firm’s ex-bosses, the New York Times finds. And the payments continue.  We need to be doing everything we can to minimize any further exposure to the taxpayers associated with these companies,  said Neugebauer, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee. The Times notes that corporations typically cover such legal fees, and Fannie and Freddie themselves spent millions to defend former execs before the takeover; but after the government moved to back the two companies, the Federal Housing Finance Agency agreed to keep footing the bill. Fannie and Freddie's losses attributed to bad loans have now reached about $150 billion.","Taxpayers Footed Fannie, Freddie's $160M Legal Bill"

He added that officials are investigating possible intelligence failures that led to the strikes. He expressed regret for the deaths and suggested the government would compensate the victims. The Turkish military confirmed last night's raids, saying its jets struck an area of northern Iraq frequently used by the rebels to enter Turkey after drones detected a group approaching the often unmarked mountainous border. It is one of the largest one-day civilian death tolls incurred during the military's 27-year-old drive against rebels, who are fighting Turkey for autonomy in the mostly Kurdish southeast.

"(Oct 17, 2015  3:09 PM CDT) Imagine building a zero-energy home. Now imagine building said house without the use of power tools or nails using files sent right to your inbox. That's the idea behind Clemson University's  Indigo Pine  design—one of 14 houses presented at this year's US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon in Irvine, Calif. More than 100 students worked for two years on the project, which touts itself as a home that's stronger than most (though it's held together with tab-and-slot connections and some screws and stainless steel zip ties) and can be built in just days, according to a release. Inhabitat explains how the process of building the 970-square-foot, 3-bedroom, 1.5-bath home would work for consumers: Digital files  are sent to a local CNC machine which mills over 500 pieces of standardized-sheets of plywood into smaller interlocking pieces.  Once shipped to the construction site, the numbered pieces can be assembled like a  3D puzzle.  Wall cavities leave room for insulation, while the exterior is clad in a reflective coating that helps beat the heat. The house also sits on a  concrete lung  foundation of concrete masonry units so air can circulate underneath. The whole thing is powered by photovoltaic panels and a solar hot water system.  Our team has invented an energy-efficient, strong, simple system called SimPly—the construction of which is faster, safer, easier, and more energy-efficient than traditional construction with power tools,  the director of Clemson's School of Architecture says, calling the zero-energy home the  beta version of what could be a market-rate, flat-packed house that could be ordered online, custom-cut, and then constructed by do-it-yourselfers.",This 3-Bedroom Home Literally Snaps Together

Megan Huntsman, 39, has been booked on six counts of murder. Investigators believe she gave birth to the babies, at least six of which were born alive, between 1996 and 2006 and suffocated or strangled them as soon as they were born, reports the Deseret News.  It's unfathomable,  a police spokesman says.  I can’t even imagine what’s going through somebody’s head to do that.

"(Feb 18, 2017  2:15 PM) Norma McCorvey, whose legal challenge under the pseudonym  Jane Roe  led to the US Supreme Court's landmark decision that legalized abortion but who later became an outspoken opponent of the procedure, died Saturday. She was 69. McCorvey died at an assisted living center in Texas, journalist Joshua Prager, who is working on a book about McCorvey told the AP. He said she died of heart failure. McCorvey was 22, unmarried, unemployed, and pregnant for the third time when in 1969 she sought to have an abortion in Texas, where the procedure was illegal except to save a woman's life. The subsequent lawsuit, known as Roe v. Wade, led to Supreme Court's 1973 ruling that established abortion rights. Decades later, McCorvey underwent a conversion, becoming an evangelical Christian and joining the anti-abortion movement. A short time later, she underwent another religious conversion and became a Roman Catholic.  I'm 100 percent pro-life. I don't believe in abortion even in an extreme situation.

Prosecutors added another 20 charges in August after more accusers came forward. The latest charges involve alleged incidents from 1996 to 2013. Another 14 cases were denied by the district attorney's office because they were outside the statute of limitations; the 1996 case was allowed because it involved a minor, Deadline reports.

"(Jul 31, 2015  4:55 AM CDT) Two chimpanzees being used for mobility research at Stony Brook University in New York will not be released to a sanctuary because a state supreme court judge has dismissed the lawsuit seeking to grant them personhood. The reason comes down to legal precedent: A higher court ruled last year that another chimpanzee, Tommy, is property, not a person, reports the AP. In May, a lawyer had argued in court for the Nonhuman Rights Project that 8-year-old chimps Hercules and Leo are  autonomous and self-determining beings  that deserve similar rights as humans. He presented hundreds of pages of opinions from a range of experts like zoologists and biologists who all felt similarly: cognitively, chimps are an advanced species.

But she added:  The past mistreatment of humans, whether slaves, women, indigenous people or others, as property, does not, however, serve as a legal predicate or appropriate analogy for extending to nonhumans the status of legal personhood.  The group plans to appeal the decision, reports the Wall Street Journal, which notes that more lawsuits are likely to be filed on behalf of animals held in captivity.

The operations were performed in early November on 130 patients who were all older than 50 and living in either Amritsar or nearby Gurdaspur, in Punjab state, an official says. Some of the patients reported this week that they'd lost their eyesight or were suffering infections. Doctors in Amritsar are treating some of the patients, but they say it's unlikely any will regain their sight. Police have launched an investigation and detained at least one doctor in Gurdaspur. Every year, thousands of people, especially in rural areas without proper health facilities, undergo cataract operations in medical camps held by health authorities and welfare groups. The case once again highlights the perilous state of health care in India, where hundreds of millions of poor people without access to doctors or health insurance are forced to seek treatment at medical camps because of poor services and corruption at government hospitals.

Trades are supposed to be honored in milliseconds, but technical problems delayed the social networking giant's debut by 30 minutes and client orders for up to two hours. For example, if an order to sell 10,000 shares was made when Facebook was worth $42 per share, but not processed until the price fell to $39 per share, the market maker would have to make up the difference of $30,000. Brokers and investors are furious; even now, a week after the IPO, some investors are only just finding out their orders were not placed at the prices they thought. The question between Nasdaq and the market markers is who will eat that loss. Some analysts say that Nasdaq's liability is limited, typically to $3 million per month, but the market makers say Nasdaq was so negligent in this case that those limits need to be overridden.

"(Apr 7, 2013  1:04 PM CDT) Lilly Pulitzer, a Palm Beach socialite turned designer whose tropical print dresses became a sensation in the 1960s and later a fashion classic, died today. She was 81. Pulitzer, who married into the famous newspaper family, got her start in fashion by spilling orange juice on her clothes. A rich housewife with time to kill and a husband who owned orange groves, she opened a juice stand in 1959, and asked her seamstress to make dresses in colorful prints that would camouflage fruit stains. The dresses hung on a pipe behind her juice stand and soon outsold her drinks; Jacqueline Kennedy, a schoolmate, even wore one in a Life magazine photo spread. The signature Lilly palette features tongue-in-cheek jungle and floral prints in blues, pinks, light greens, yellow, and orange—the colors of a Florida vacation.

"(Jun 26, 2020  12:33 PM CDT) Ancient dogs specially adapted to the cold have been helping humans survive in the Arctic for a surprisingly long time—more than 10,000 years—a new study suggests.  Until now, we have thought that sledge dogs were only [2,000 to] 3,000 years old,  says Mikkel Sinding, a University of Copenhagen geneticist and co-author of the study in Science. But in comparing DNA from a dog that lived 9,500 years ago on Zhokhov Island, where evidence of early dog sleds has been found, to the genetics of modern sled dogs (including Alaskan and Siberian huskies, Alaskan malamutes, and dogs in Greenland), researchers found they share many of the same genes.  This means that modern sledge dogs and [the Zhokhov dog] had the same common origin in Siberia more than 9,500 years ago,  says Sinding. Dogs in Greenland, for example, don't seem to have changed much from their Zhokhov ancestor.  It’s largely the same dogs doing the same thing,  Sinding says. It's not clear when the first sled dog was domesticated, but the Zhokhov dog was already  a long way down the path to domestication,  Sinding tells New Scientist. Like modern sled dogs, it had long fur and thick pads on its feet. Modern sled dogs may have also received from their ancestors an adaptation allowing them to thrive on a fat-rich diet. Ice Age Siberians probably didn't mind sharing their hunted seals and polar bears. As co-author Shyam Gopalakrishnan tells NBC News, the ability  to move large amounts of material, kills and food across large spaces in such difficult terrain  was perhaps  instrumental in humans settling the Arctic.","Humans and Sled Dogs: a 10,000-Year History"

The starlet appeared before a judge yesterday for the fourth time in nearly a year and was sentenced to 120 days for violating her probation by taking a designer necklace. But the judge also reduced the actress' charge from felony grand theft to a misdemeanor. Lohan's attorney filed a notice of appeal right before court closed, clearing the way for the actress' release on bail after a few hours. Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said she thought the actress had intentionally taken the $2,500 necklace from an upscale Venice store and shown poor judgment in not trying to return it until police became involved. But she said the reduction in charge is typical in such cases. Click for more.",Lindsay Lohan Released on $75K Bail
"(Feb 12, 2018  4:17 AM) The three people killed in a Grand Canyon helicopter crash Saturday were all British tourists, authorities say. They've been named as Becky Dobson, 27, Jason Hill, 32, and Stuart Hill, 30, the Guardian reports. Three other badly injured British tourists and their American pilot were airlifted to a hospital in Las Vegas at around 2am Sunday. Authorities say it took eight hours for the survivors to be removed from the crash scene because of high winds and rough terrain.  We are told by witnesses and also by rescuers that people trying to help once they saw this accident happen, they couldn't get down to the helicopter quick enough,  local news reporter Gabby Hart told the BBC. The survivors  had to receive care there on-site until emergency crews were able to remove them from the scene,  Hart said. Photographer Teddy Fujimoto tells the Guardian that he was conducting a wedding shoot near the crash site and saw terrible scenes 600 feet below. He says he saw two women, one  pretty much burned all over.  One of them kept calling out a man's name, he says.

These weren’t conservatives, they argued—just look at their American Conservative Union scores! So Milbank did.  What I found was astonishing,  he writes in the Washington Post. Murkowski and Bennett boasted ACU scores of 70.2% and 83.6%, respectively. If Republicans applied that purity test to other politicians,  they would have rejected many of the leading Republican lawmakers of the past 40 years.  Gerald Ford had a measly 67% rating. Bob Dole and Senate leader Howard Baker clocked in at 82%, below Bennett; Baker’s predecessor, Hugh Scott, rated a mere 29%. Yes, Alaska is pretty conservative, but it didn’t seem to mind Ted Stevens (64%). Of course, in today’s House,  95% and above is the new normal,  and in the Senate, only a handful of sub-90s remain, like Dick Lugar, Chuck Grassley, and Lamar Alexander.

The AP reports the shooting happened in a small office in an engineering building called Boelter Hall, and a gun was found along with what might be a suicide note. ABC 7 identified the victim as engineering professor William Klug. The shooter was a student, according to New York Daily News. The campus on the west side of Los Angeles was locked down, and dozens of officers with the LAPD and the university's police force ran across the campus, some with weapons drawn. At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall. People emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. Many students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. At a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. One man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. Bioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see  a lot of police activity with innumerable cars  and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building.

"(Jan 23, 2008  8:35 AM) Surgery is better than dieting and exercise to help people suffering from type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Three of four patients—73%—who underwent  lap-banding  surgery lost 20% of their body weight and were in diabetic remission within two years, WebMD reports. That compares with a 13% remission rate for patients undergoing conventional therapy of diet, exercise, and drugs and who lost an average of 1.7% of their body weight. Traditionally considered a viable option only for the extremely obese, the findings suggest that surgery should also be considered for diabetics. Detractors maintain, however, that dieting and exercise aren't often effective because they're not given institutional support.  The idea that health insurers might pay for surgery but not for a dietitian is troubling,  said one critic.",Surgery Kicks Type 2 Diabetes Better Than Dieting: Study

The nude woman wandered into traffic on US-290 around 9am, a Harris County sheriff's deputy tells the Houston Chronicle; the situation caused a three-car pileup (some outlets imply that was due to her walking into traffic, while others say she may have been driving one of the cars). At some point the woman climbed on top of a 15-foot-tall big rig, where she occasionally danced and also yelled at authorities. (KCEN notes that she was seen  twerking and gyrating  at various points.) It's not clear exactly how she got on top of the 18-wheel truck. Authorities believe the woman was first involved in two separate hit-and-runs nearby, and entered the highway after allegedly fleeing those and ditching her clothes. The highway was shut down in both directions during the incident; firefighters finally got her down from the truck at 11am. The scene drew spectators, and one says that while the whole thing started out  funny,  it ended up  kind of saddening.

Public health officials in Oregon are distinguishing the willful disregard of protocols that leads to superspreader events, such as large weddings, from an individual's poor decision, after a person who was sick there went to work this month and touched off a trail of coronavirus cases. At least seven people died in Douglas County the next two weeks, Oregon Live reports. That's almost 20% of the total pandemic death toll in the county, which the state has decreed is at  extreme risk  from COVID-19. Another outbreak followed, causing the quarantine of 300-plus people.  The latest and most concerning trend is that we are seeing cases where residents are choosing to go to work and school when they are still sick,  says Bob Dannenhoffer, the county's health officer.  We can't even imagine the tremendous remorse these people are feeling right now.  As in other states, workers have gradually been returning to their workplaces after shutdowns, per the Washington Post. Safety measures have been taken, and Oregon has a mask mandate, but there have still been outbreaks in meatpacking plants, supermarkets, warehouses, hospitals, and schools. Douglas County has had its problems with parties, too: At least half of the 50 people in their 60s who attended a Halloween party came down with the virus. Dannenhoffer says the county has had an especially rough time with the virus this month, and an examination of the cases shows there's no mystery to it.

The Guardian reports that the then-4-year-old, who lived with her elderly grandparents in a remote wooded area in Russia's Tuva Republic, found her 60-year-old grandmother not responding last month. Her grandfather, who's blind, couldn't venture out for help, and so Saglana grabbed a box of matches and headed out into the minus-29-degree weather to try to get to the nearest neighbor's house about 5 miles away. The Siberian Times notes Saglana had gone on walks with her grandmother in the past and recalled that even though there was no road, if she followed the river, she'd eventually hit the neighbor's house. She waded through snow that was sometimes chest-deep, luckily avoiding any resident wolves.  She could have easily stumbled on a pack in the darkness,  the local rescue group's head tells the Guardian. One of the neighbors at her destination spotted Saglana as she walked past (she apparently couldn't see the house through the weeds) and phoned for help. Sadly, when medical staff rushed to Saglana's home, it was discovered her grandmother had died of a heart attack—and in more bad news, Tuva officials have opened a criminal probe into her mom for leaving Saglana with her elderly grandparents, who may have not been able to properly care for her.

"(Dec 12, 2015  11:30 AM) There has yet to be a confirmed US collision between a drone and a manned aircraft, but there's a growing number of close calls as drones fly where they least belong—near airports. A report released Friday counted at least 241 reports of close encounters between drones and manned aircraft that meet the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of a near-collision, including 28 incidents in which pilots had to veer out of the way. The analysis by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone found that 90 of the close drone encounters involved commercial jets. The FAA defines a near-collision as two aircraft flying within 500 feet of each other. In 51 of the incidents studied, the drone-to-aircraft clearance was 50 feet or less, the report said. Most of the sightings occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet. Those are spaces in which the FAA prohibits drones from flying, raising questions about the effectiveness of the rules. The cities with the most incidents were New York, Newark, Los Angeles, and Miami. The report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that it's hard for pilots to judge their distance from another object when flying at high speeds. The majority of the incidents, 64%, were sightings of drones in the vicinity of other aircraft with no immediate threat of collision. The Bard report is the first comprehensive analysis of the sightings by researchers outside the aviation community.","Report: 90 'Near Collisions' Between Drones, Commercial Jets"

It happened Friday night at a Sotheby's auction in London, when the enigmatic street artist's 2006 Girl With Balloon painting was sold off for $1.1 million to a bidder on the phone. However, shortly after the gavel came down on the sale, something unexpected happened: The print inside the frame started moving downward as it was slowly shredded. Per the Financial Times, via Vice, the shredding took place  by a mechanism apparently hidden within the base of the frame, with most of the work emerging from the bottom in strips.   We've just been Banksy'ed,  Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director, told the crowd after the shredfest, adding he hadn't known ahead of time that this was going to happen and that  tonight we saw a little piece of Banksy genius.

The star sapphire—named for the star-shaped reflection that appears on its polished surface—weighs 1404.49 carats, according to a certificate from the Gemology Institute of Colombo; the previous record-holder weighs only slightly less at 1,395 carats, reports the BBC.  When the stone was brought to me I suspected that it might be the world's largest blue star sapphire, so I took a risk and bought it,  the anonymous owner says. He won't say what he paid for the stone, reportedly found last August, but experts say it's worth about $100 million. The owner thinks he could get as much as $175 million for it at auction, but  I am not interested in selling it at the moment as it first needs international exposure,  he tells Ceylon Today. He adds the rock is too big to be  set in any kind of jewelry  and is  destined to be a priceless museum piece.  He is said to have called the gem the Star of Adam, based on the Muslim belief that Adam traveled to Sri Lanka after he was banished from the Garden of Eden and cried tears that became the region's gems.

As of Monday morning, eight days after Julen Rosello fell into the narrow borehole while with his family in Totalan, the lead engineer explained why progress has been slow. The AP reports Angel Garcia Vidal said the drill has been moving through extremely hard granite and that the work had to cease briefly early Monday for maintenance work on the drill. The drill is creating a shaft parallel to the borehole that needs to get to a depth of about 200 feet, where they believe the child is. Miners will descend into the new shaft and then dig a horizontal tunnel by hand to Julen's assumed location, a process that should take roughly 20 hours. The drill was as of earlier Monday at about 175 feet.

Megan Pinion, a Louisiana schoolteacher, was scandalized Sunday when she saw the two coffee drinks she had bought at a Mall of Louisiana Starbucks: One had what could be a pentagram drawn in the foam (though she conceded it is  almost OK  because Starbucks has a star in its logo); the other had the number  666.  Pinion promptly posted a picture to Starbuck's Facebook page; it was liked and shared by thousands, and now Starbucks has apologized, the Daily Advertiser reports.  We’re taking the complaint seriously,  says a rep. We're not sure who served her or what kind of beverage it was. It looks kind of caramel-ish in the photos.  In her Facebook complaint, Pinion wrote of the barista (whose name she didn't get because she was too  appalled  to look at him):  I am in no way judging his beliefs or dis-meriting his beautiful artwork, I am however judging his lack of professionalism and respect for others.  Starbucks won't say whether the employee will be disciplined, the Huffington Post reports.

"(Oct 19, 2014  10:27 AM CDT) If you're a tetrachromat—which, odds are, you aren't—you can see more colors than the rest of us, thanks to an extra structure in your eyes. The structure, known as a cone, detects certain light wavelengths. With three cones, most of us can see about a million colors, while tetrachromats, who have four, can see 100 million, Popular Science reports. One such person is an artist named Concetta Antico, who explains her experience gazing at a leaf:  Around the edge I’ll see orange or red or purple in the shadow; you might see dark green but I’ll see violet, turquoise, blue ... It's like a mosaic of color.  Only about 1% of humans are tetrachromats, and it would appear that the condition is limited to women—though, the Huffington Post reports, researchers aren't certain about that. Women have two X chromosomes, and theories have suggested that the condition depends on mutations in both. Researchers have been studying Antico to learn more about tetrachromatism. Meanwhile, the rest of us can perhaps benefit from looking at her artwork: As the Huffington Post notes, her  canvases seem to burst with extra, vivid color as only she can depict.  For others, the BBC reports, the condition may be a nuisance at times: One woman describes seeing major clashing in clothes others believe match.

Shirley Player, 61, stole about $92,000 a year between 2007 and 2014 from the real estate company she worked for to  settle debts, pay rents, and [buy] 'family treats,'  a prosecutor at her trial said in court—and it was all because  she had not expected to be still here,  the attorney added. One of Player's defense attorneys told the court that she was simply trying to plan ahead for her almost-certain demise, the Daily Express reports.  She told me she had wanted to do something for her family as she was not going to be here much longer,  he said.  I asked her where the money went. She does not know.  Player was said to have made 390 transactions into four separate accounts over the seven-year period, hiding them as  tenant deposit returns,  the Daily Mail notes. The theft was eventually discovered this year during a company audit. Player was also maybe relying too heavily on prescience: Even though she didn't have cancer when she started her stealing spree—she wasn't diagnosed until 2010—Player had had two sisters who succumbed to cancer and figured it was only a matter of time before she did, too. Even Player's husband, Malcolm, says he had no clue about the pilfered cash until the cops came calling.  We weren't driving around in Bentleys and drinking champagne,  he says.

CNBC reports the city of Boston is the latest to drop Fisher, withdrawing nearly $250 million in pension assets, joining Michigan, which has taken back $600 million from the firm, and Philadelphia, which pulled out $54 million. That's nearly $1 billion of the $112 billion the firm oversees. Fidelity Investments, meanwhile, is mulling whether to yank $500 million of its assets, with a spokesman saying the company is  very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments.  CNBC reports the world first got wind of Ken Fisher's remarks when Alex Chalekian, an attendee at the Tiburon CEO Summit, tweeted last Wednesday,  I'm truly disgusted.  Chalekian posted a selfie video in which he called Fisher's  fireside chat  a  true debacle,  noting Fisher also talked about Jeffrey Epstein and tripping on acid, and that an ex-Fisher employee told him Fisher once said slavery should never have been abolished. CNBC obtained audio from the summit, in which Fisher can be heard advising caution when approaching new clients:  It's like going up to ... a woman in a bar and saying, 'Hey, I want to talk about what's in your pants.  The outlet also has a clip from a 2018 conference in which Fisher compared marketing mutual funds to propositioning a woman for sex.

"(Oct 29, 2010  3:43 AM CDT) A 4-year-old girl who seriously injured an elderly woman in a bicycle accident was old enough to know better and can thereby be sued for negligence, a Manhattan judge decided yesterday. The 87-year-old woman fractured her hip after being hit by the girl and a friend who were racing bikes with training wheels on a city sidewalk. The woman died three weeks later, and her estate filed a lawsuit against the children and their parents. The judge didn't determine liability in the case—only that the girl can be sued. There was no evidence that the girl lacked intelligence or maturity, and nothing to  indicate that another child of similar age and capacity under the circumstances could not have reasonably appreciated the danger of riding a bicycle into an elderly woman,  the judge wrote, citing cases from as far back as 1928. He decided that the girl's mother, who was present at the time, didn't encourage her daughter's risky behavior, and that she played no  active role  in the incident, the New York Times reports.  A parent’s presence alone does not give a reasonable child carte blanche to engage in risky behavior such as running across a street,  the judge wrote.","Court: Girl, 4, Can Be Sued for Negligence"

Demarlon Thomas, 31, was transitioning out of the federal prison system in a Saginaw, Mich., halfway house after having his sentence commuted Nov. 22. Two masked gunmen brandishing assault-style weapons sought out and killed Thomas, a former member of Saginaw’s Sunny Side Gang, at that halfway house Monday night, reports MLive.  They were looking for this person,  a Michigan State Police officer says, describing the shooting as execution-style. One gunman shot Thomas numerous times, while the other held 23 others at gunpoint; ultimately, no one else was injured.  I think it was connected one way or another to the gang he was from or a rival gang,  the officer tells Michigan Radio. The suspects are still at large. Thomas had been sentenced to 19 years in prison in 2008 for distributing cocaine after a federal investigation that authorities thought had put an end to the Sunny Side Gang. Thanks to Obama commuting his sentence, he had been scheduled to go free in March, about eight years earlier than his original release date.

"(Jul 6, 2019  8:30 AM CDT) Divers and crews using underwater sonar devices searched Friday for three people who went missing on two Alabama lakes after a pair of holiday boating accidents, and authorities later confirmed one person was dead, in addition to several injured. Both happened after dark on July 4 on large reservoirs that are popular destinations for people seeking relief from the summer heat, per the AP. Capt. Gary Buchanan, a spokesman for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's Marine Patrol, said two 19-foot boats collided on Lake Jordan, north of Montgomery. He added that five others were hurt, and two of them were hospitalized with serious injuries. The missing were identified as Clay Jackson, 26, of Deatsville, and Tyler House, 17, of Marbury. Searchers paused at nightfall, and Buchanan said they'd resume the search for the missing on Saturday morning. Crews also searched Friday for a person missing after a boating accident on Smith Lake north of Birmingham, Buchanan said. The agency later said in an emailed statement Friday night that a 12-year-old girl had died and two other children were injured: another 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. All were from Pontotoc County in Mississippi, it said. The statement didn't immediately give details on what happened. Authorities say that accident involved a 19-foot deck boat-style vessel. While skies were clear, high temperatures were forecast in the 90s this week, and Buchanan said the intense heat made conditions worse for searchers, who were concentrated on recovering bodies on the nearly 7,000-acre Lake Jordan rather than finding survivors.  It works against us because of the stress that puts on the divers and their gear and the search teams that are out there in the sun and the heat,  Buchanan said.","They Were Enjoying July 4 on the Water.

"(Nov 12, 2019  11:43 AM) Southwest Airlines couldn't produce safety data for 38 jets, which caused the Federal Aviation Administration to consider—but ultimately delay—grounding those jets, the Wall Street Journal reveals. The airline brought 88 used foreign jets into its fleet between 2013 and 2017, and last year an FAA official uncovered abnormalities with the paperwork. Southwest has since informed the FAA that for some of the planes, it has struggled to find reliable paperwork indicating that necessary repairs and maintenance were carried out by previous operators, but that Southwest considers it  more of a record-keeping problem than a safety risk,  per the Journal. Ultimately the FAA allowed the planes to continue flying as long as Southwest sped up inspections and finished them by the end of January. CNN notes the issue was brought to light after a Senate panel released paperwork Monday. Of the 88 jets in question, 41 have been inspected and deemed compliant and nine are undergoing inspections. A veteran maintenance inspector first expressed concern about the remaining 38 planes last year, and more inspectors continued to complain to FAA managers this year that paperwork was missing. By Oct. 29, the FAA was threatening to ground the planes, all of which are Boeing 737s. Discussions between the FAA and Southwest then ensued, and the Jan. 31 deadline was agreed upon. Southwest tells the Journal none of the discrepancies in question would make flights unsafe.

"(Mar 2, 2020  4:26 PM) Owners of iPhones could receive $25 from Apple after the company agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle claims over intentionally slowing down older phones to preserve older batteries. Apple and lawyers representing iPhone consumers agreed to a deal stemming from Apple's 2017 admission that it was slowing down phone performance in older models, the AP reports, to avoid unexpected shutdowns related to battery fatigue. That admission led to Apple offering discounted battery replacements at $29, but many people claimed they had already spent hundreds of dollars to buy new phones because Apple didn't reveal the cause of the problem. If they had known they could just buy new batteries, they might not have bought new phones, some consumers in the case said.",Apple Settles Suit for $25 per iPhone Owner
"(Jan 13, 2014  4:39 PM) A family gathered yesterday for dinner in Franklin, Mass., only to discover that two young siblings had locked themselves in a hope chest and were unresponsive, the Boston Globe reports. The children—Lexi Munroe, 8, and her brother Sean, 7—were rushed to hospital and later pronounced dead, leaving family members too distraught to help investigators. A neighbor brought the three surviving children over to her house during the ordeal, reports another Globe article.  They were in bad shape,  the neighbor said.  They were crying and really sad.  Several family members were home when it happened, including at least one parent, but no one noticed the children crawl into the large chest that automatically locks when closed.  The hope chest was in relatively close proximity to a television that was apparently on with a substantial volume at the time,  said a spokesman for the Norfolk District Attorney, CBS Boston reports. Lane Furniture, which makes the chests, recalled 12 million of them in 1996 after at least six children died in similar fashion. Federal regulators warned about the chests for years, but at least 6 million of them remain in circulation, the New York Daily News reports. The family apparently bought their chest second-hand at least a decade ago.",2 Children Dead After Getting Locked in Hope Chest
"(Jan 11, 2014  9:24 AM) A charity formed after the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has been unable to account for more than $70,000 it raised through marathon running. Co-founder Ryan Graney of Nashville said only $30,000 of the $103,000 taken in by the 26.4.26 Foundation was used for the organization's purpose. That money was presented last January by co-founder Robbie Bruce to the nonprofit NYA, a youth sports center in Newtown, where the December 2012 shooting occurred. Graney said that Bruce was in charge of the organization's finances, but that Bruce has cut off contact with her. He could not be reached to comment. Graney, meanwhile, has filed complaints with the FBI and the Tennessee attorney general's office. The idea behind the 26.4.26 Foundation was for runners to participate in marathons, raising money for each of the 26 miles they ran and dedicating each mile to one of the 26 victims of the school shooting—20 children and six educators. The fundraising effort was featured in Runner's World magazine and was the subject of several local news stories.",Newtown Charity Is Missing $70K in Donations
"(May 17, 2020  2:40 PM CDT) An indie filmmaker known for her ad-lib style and complex female characters died Friday after falling ill only a week ago, the Daily Beast reports. Her name was Lynn Shelton.  I have some awful news,  said podcaster and comedian Marc Maron, who was romantically involved with her.  Lynn passed away last night. She collapsed yesterday morning after having been ill for a week. There was a previously unknown, underlying condition. It was not COVID-19. The doctors could not save her. They tried. Hard.  Media reports attribute the 54-year-old's death in LA to an undetected blood disorder. They also delve into her late-blooming film career, which grew out of Seattle's creative scene and led to movies like We Go Way Back (2006) and Sword of Trust (2019). But it was Humpday, starring Mark Duplass, that made her an indie darling with its Special Jury Prize at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, per the New York Times.  The movie's unblinking observation of a friendship put to the test is amused, queasy making, kindhearted and unfailingly truthful,  wrote a Times reviewer. Shelton became a pioneer in the so-called  mumblecore  movement with her low-budget, naturalistic, semi-improvised films; she also directed episodes of TV shows including Master of None, Mad Men, and GLOW, per the LA Times.  Her boundless creative energy and infectious spirit were unrivaled,  says Duplass.  She made me better. We butted heads, made up, laughed, pushed each other. Like family.

Prince was 91. Prince's publicist said Prince died Wednesday after a brief illness in Reykjavik, Iceland, the AP reports. Prince was known for his fluid, cinematic director's touch and was unpredictable and uncompromising in his choice of stage material.

"(Nov 15, 2013  6:26 AM) Unnamed officials say TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes at LAX before being taken to an ambulance. For 28 of those minutes, alleged shooter Paul Ciancia was in police custody, though officers hadn't yet declared the area safe to enter. Officers checked on Hernandez, who was just 20 feet from an exit, then moved on while paramedics waited 150 yards away, the AP reports, noting it's not clear if immediate attention might have saved Hernandez's life. Now under review: the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter, and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. While an officer who checked on Hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead, the AP reports that it's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination; no first-aid was administered.  I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,  an LAX employee says.  We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.  The results of the investigation could be months away, the AP adds.

A local police spokeswoman tells the AP that police responded to a call around 10am local time and went to a house in Tribistovo, where several people were found dead. The village is about 95 miles southwest of Sarajevo, the capital. Regional police Commissioner Milan Galic later told the N1 broadcaster that the victims were local residents, four men and four women, ages 18 to 20.  They most probably suffocated, but more information will be available after the investigation,  said Galic. In a Facebook post, the Posusje municipality where the village is located mourned  eight young lives lost  and urged local cafes and restaurants to close down to honor the victims.

"(May 17, 2012  7:44 AM CDT) Europe has hundreds of billions of reasons to try to keep Greece from unceremoniously ditching the eurozone. If Greece leaves, the rest of Europe would face catastrophic losses, Reuters reports. Greece would default on the roughly $250 billion in debt held by the ECB, IMF, and other eurozone nations, and that loss will likely be  high enough to eliminate the ECB's capital,  one investor said. And the losses wouldn't end there because Europe would still probably have to prevent a total collapse or risk economic contagion. How bad could it get? One Guardian estimate puts the total cost at $1 trillion. But it's looking increasingly unlikely Greece will abide by its bailout deal; new elections are looming, and polls favor Alexis Tsipras' far-left party. In a BBC interview, Tsipras urged Europe, and particularly Angela Merkel, to  stop playing poker with the lives of people  by demanding such harsh austerity measures. That defiance has some European decision-makers pushing to rip the Band-Aid off and boot Greece.  It's going to hurt, absolutely,  one diplomat tells Reuters.

The Charles County Sheriff's Office says Ji'Aire Donnell Lee died of thirst and hypothermia at some point during the 44 hours that his mother, 24-year-old Romechia Simms, was in the park pushing the boy on the swing, reports the Washington Post. Police say that when they arrived after a call from a worried citizen,  it was instantaneously clear the child was dead.  The boy was found dead on the morning of May 22, following a night when it was  rather chilly and it drizzled all night,  a police spokeswoman tells the Baltimore Sun. The death has been ruled a homicide, but authorities say they haven't made a decision on filing charges yet, the Sun reports. Simms' mother says she was diagnosed with mental illness a few months ago. Simms was hospitalized after she was found in the park but released in time for her son's funeral, reports the New York Daily News.

British cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76, some 55 years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at 21 and given two years to live. Family members say Hawking died peacefully early Wednesday at his home in Cambridge, England, the BBC reports.  We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,  children Lucy, Robert, and Tim said in a statement, per Sky.  He once said: 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever.  Hawking, born in 1942, was known for his groundbreaking research on black holes and the origins of the universe. Books like best-seller A Brief History of Time made him what the AP calls  one of science's biggest celebrities since Albert Einstein,  appearing on shows including The Simpsons and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Signs of his illness—also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease—appeared during his first year of graduate school. He lost what remained of his voice in 1985.  I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years,  he told the Guardian in a 2010 interview.  I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die.

The Boston Globe reports that residents of Dorchester came together last night to honor young Martin Richard. His mother suffered a serious brain injury in the blast and his 6-year-old sister lost a leg, reports WHDH, which notes that a single candle sat outside the family's home last night, with the word  peace  written on the sidewalk. The three were waiting for Martin's father to finish the race, reports the AP. Globe columnist Kevin Cullen spoke with firefighters, and paints an even more wrenching story: He writes that Martin  had gone out to hug his dad after he crossed the finish line. The dad walked on; the boy went back to the sidewalk to join his mom and his little sister. And then the bomb went off.  Boston-area hospitals have received at least 144 patients, 17 with critical injuries. At least eight children were being treated at hospitals, and outside of Tufts Medical Center's Children's Wing, a flag flew at half-mast last night.

It's addressed to one Raymond Hamilton, a one-time member of their gang who, at the time the letter was written, was behind bars in the Dallas County Jail. That he was there was a reflection of just how  yellow  he was, per the letter, as he didn't try to flee as he was captured. The Dallas Morning News reports the trio had a falling out over Hamilton's girlfriend (the  prostitute sweetheart  the letter refers to); the AP cites a disagreement over how to divvy up $4,000 they had taken from a Texas bank earlier that year. This after Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker famously rescued Hamilton and four others from a Texas prison farm in January 1934, per a New York Daily News article written that year. Hamilton was serving sentences totaling 262 years at the time. The lines are biting.  I should have killed you then I would have saved myself much bother and money looking for you,  reads the letter, which Boston-based RR Auction says was likely dictated by Barrow to Parker, who had superior writing skills.

Jeff Anderson, who represents former Scouts who say they were abused, said an expert hired by the Scouts to audit the files on suspected abusers found that there were 7,819 suspected perpetrators and 12,254 victims between 1944 and 2016, Fox reports.  That is a number not known before today or ever revealed by the Boy Scouts of America,  he said at a press conference in New York. He said the alarming thing is not just the number, but  the fact is that the Boy Scouts of America has never actually released these names in any form that can be known to the public.  Anderson said the number of suspected abusers and victims was revealed during a trial in January, ABC reports. He said that the names of the suspects were not given to the public or the police, meaning that while they may have been banned from Scouting, they would have been free to work with children elsewhere, NBC 4 reports. Anderson plans to file multiple lawsuits on behalf of victims in August, when New York's Child Victims Act takes effect.

The dealer is accused of paying a co-conspirator to travel to Africa, buy raw ivory for carving, and stain it so the specimens looked much older than they were, the BBC reports. Hundreds of carvings and scores of tusks, amounting to more than a ton of ivory worth at least $1 million, were seized from the dealer and his customers, notes the Philadelphia Inquirer.  It's safe to say dozens of elephants sit before you,  a federal agent said as the haul, one of the biggest in US history, was displayed to reporters.

"(Jul 5, 2012  6:08 AM CDT) With would-be homebuyers continuing to sit on the sidelines, rental vacancies dropped to a 10-year low last quarter, driving up rental prices to record levels around the United States, reports the Wall Street Journal. Rental prices have reached record highs in 74 of 82 markets measured by real estate tracking firm Reis. The biggest climb last quarter came from New York City, where average rents jumped 1.7% to a hefty $2,935 per month.  The market is in a very tight position,  Reis said in a research report.  There is a paucity of available units.  Nationwide, rental vacancy rates are just 4.7%—only the third quarter in 30 years they have been below 5%—down significantly from 8% in 2009, around the worst part of the economic downturn. But with people worried about job security, tighter lending standards, and wariness over long-term housing prices, rental demand is expanded to stay strong, pushing rents ever higher. The one wildcard, however, is new apartment construction—builders are racing to begin 235,000 units this year, then 285,000 in 2013, and 320,000 in 2014. A flood of new units could drive rents back down.","Rents Hit Record Highs, Vacancies at 10-Year Lows"

"(Dec 16, 2014  10:01 AM) Four years ago, NASA knew it wouldn't likely use a giant tower originally intended to test rockets—because the testing program was canceled. Yet the agency kept building the A-3 test stand and finally finished the $349 million project in June. And the costs keep coming, with the Mississippi structure expected to require $700,000 each year in maintenance, the Washington Post reports.  You lock the door, so nobody gets in and hurts themselves,  says the project's former boss. Now, the tower is a giant ode to an agency that has lost its  sense of purpose,  David A. Fahrenthold writes:  There's no 'why'  at NASA these days, says its former No. 2. The test stand, near Gulfport, was once expected to send people back to the moon and to Mars, at a projected cost of $119 million. But costs kept rising, and with plans to get back to the moon looking less achievable, President Obama in 2010 called for an end to the program, dubbed  Constellation,  that included the tower. But the Senate, in an effort fueled by Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker, voted to continue funding the construction.  When it comes down to their pork, they’re always going to defend it,  a space policy expert told Bloomberg early this year in a piece that dubbed the stand  useless.  Even now, to actually use the stand would require a few more years' work, says a NASA official. It's one of seven stands currently  mothballed,  with another being renovated nearby.

"(Dec 23, 2020  3:22 PM) The coronavirus restrictions on restaurants have sparked large demonstrations in New York City, and now a group of restaurant owners is considering a more targeted response. After a ban on indoor dining was reinstated, there's talk in the industry of implementing a ban on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio dining at their establishments, Fox News reports.  I came up with this motto—if we can't feed our families, we certainly won't feed yours,  said organizer Michael Quinn. He points out that banning indoor dining just pushes people to gather in homes and other places that don't have the safety measures in place that restaurants have. The state says 70% of coronavirus cases can be traced to households and small gatherings, while no more than 2% have been attributed to indoor dining at restaurants. And speaking of those safety measures,  a case of gloves costs us almost $100 depending on which gloves you’re buying, and I'm going through five boxes a day just to make sure I'm incredibly careful,  the owner of a pasta restaurant said. But he doesn't like the idea of turning any customers away, including de Blasio or Cuomo, though he notes  they don’t have the empathy that they need to have. Respectfully, they still get guaranteed their paychecks.

"(Oct 6, 2009  9:50 AM CDT) Apartment vacancies have hit a 23-year high, as rampant unemployment continues to drive down demand, according to a New York real-estate research firm.

The experience was night-and-day different  from years past, says one New York City renter, whose new landlord tossed in a free first month.  Renters are the ones with the power.  Usually the second and third quarters are renters’ strongest months, but this year  vacancies just continued rising,  a researcher said.

More than 350 people, many refugees from Eritrea, drowned, and European leaders promised action, reports the New York Times. But when 243 passengers, again largely refugees from Eritrea, were supposed to be aboard an Italy-bound boat and disappeared without a trace less than a year later, on June 28, 2014, the press, and the world, turned a blind eye, reports Eric Reidy on Medium. Reidy tries to follow the story of one Eritrean woman named Segen who was supposed to be on the  ghost boat,  which was to depart from Libya. She survived the perilous journey across the country with her baby Abigail in her arms; the last time her husband spoke with her was the day she was supposed to board the boat—if the refugees ever boarded it. Reidy notes that  ?experts say there would almost certainly be evidence  of a maritime disaster so large, and there are no records of such a boat arriving in Europe, sinking, or being aided. One activist heard word that the 243 were potentially being held in a Tunisian jail;  her findings were inconclusive.  Says Segen's husband, who stayed in neighboring Sudan with their now 4-year-old girl Shalom:  If you remember Charlie Hebdo in Paris ...

Police said they questioned more than 250 residents of the western Delhi neighborhood where the 2 1/2-year-old girl was raped and left bleeding in a park Friday evening. The two 17-year-old boys were arrested late Saturday, per a top police officer; the deputy commissioner of police said after they were interrogated, the teens admitted their guilt. The toddler was playing outside her home when she went missing during a 10-minute power outage in the neighborhood. Family members found her lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours later. In a separate incident, police on Saturday arrested three men for raping a 5-year-old in an east Delhi suburb.

"(Dec 9, 2019  9:09 AM) Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who in the early 1980s raised interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double-digit inflation, has died. He was 92, per the AP. The New York Times and Washington Post report his death was confirmed by his daughter, Janice Zima, who tells the Post his death was due to complications from prostate cancer. Volcker took charge of the Fed in August 1979, when the US economy was slipping into the grip of runaway inflation, the AP notes. Consumer prices skyrocketed 13% in 1979, and then by the same amount in 1980. The 6-foot-7-inch Volcker, who the Times notes had a  reputation for austere integrity,  worked relentlessly to bring prices under control. He pushed the Fed’s benchmark interest rate from 11% to a record 20% by late 1980 to try to slow the economy’s growth and shrink inflation. Those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily. By January 1980, a recession had begun, which lasted six months. A deeper downturn took hold in July 1981, enduring for 18 months and sending unemployment up to 10.8%, the highest since the Great Depression. In the midst of it, Volcker was vilified by the public. But the pain eventually paid off, and inflation receded. Once it did, Volcker’s Fed began lowering interest rates, and the economy bounded back. After the 2008 financial crisis, President Obama recruited Volcker as an adviser. Volcker pressed for regulations on banks that became known as the Volcker Rule, and were included in a far-reaching financial overhaul bill Congress passed in 2010.",Ex-Fed Chief Paul Volcker Dead at 92

Another fighter gives a slightly different take to Reuters:  Some of Gadhafi's forces sneaked in among the rebels and fired anti-aircraft guns in the air.

A police sting caught Weinstein admitting on tape that he grabbed an Italian model's breasts. But after a stable of well-connected Weinstein lawyers and handlers mobilized to discredit Ambra Battilana, 22, the case was dropped within two weeks in April 2015. Prosecutors, including current New York City DA Cyrus Vance, decided Battilana wasn't a credible witness because she disavowed statements she made in Italy related to a sex harassment claim, as well as a sex party thrown by former PM Silvio Berlusconi. Weinstein's lawyers said he touched Battilana's breasts to determine if they were real for a lingerie ad. Prosecutors decided the allegations weren't strong enough. The police disagree.  We brought them a very good case,  a senior NYPD official tells the Times. After the case was dropped, the Times says  Weinstein silenced Ms. Battilana with a substantial payment,  though she says she then watched her fashion career fizzle. Meanwhile, the NYPD said on Sunday they were probing new allegations against Weinstein. And in London, cops said a third accuser stepped forward accusing Weinstein, 65, of sexually assaulting her three times between 2010 and 2015, the Telegraph reports.

But while Lehrer was for years a familiar face for public television viewers, the New York Times says he became a household name in part thanks to the dozen presidential debates he moderated.

Per local media reports cited by AFP, the 41-year-old man was discovered Sunday after his mother ended up in the hospital and an unidentified family member went to her apartment in the Stockholm suburb of Haninge. Reports in the Expressen and Aftonbladet newspapers say the mother is suspected of yanking him out of school when he was 12 or so and keeping him locked up ever since, though police spokesman Ola Osterling would only say he'd been held  for a very long time.  Osterling confirmed that the man has been hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, with reports noting he was found with sore-ridden legs and next to no teeth, was barely mobile, and had only a limited ability to speak.

"(Oct 30, 2017  3:48 PM CDT) It's been more than three weeks since that first New York Times story opened the floodgates on the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment and assault scandal, and since that exposé, dozens of women have come forward with related stories to tell about the disgraced producer. A new story in the Times Monday is not only expanding the number of women making allegations, but also the timeline: Two women now say they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein in the 1970s, stretching the accusations out over four decades. Hope Exiner d'Amore, 62, says Weinstein raped her in a New York City hotel in the late '70s, while Cynthia Burr, also 62, says Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway, also in NYC during the same period.  This has haunted me my entire life,  Exiner d’Amore tells the Times, which also reveals other new allegations from two other women. In other Weinstein-related news, Vulture notes that  seeds of fresh chaos have been sewn  regarding the future of the Weinstein Company, and Harvey's brother, Bob,  is facing serious troubles of his own.  Per two sources who claim they're tight with TWC execs, Bob is increasingly being pegged a  liability  by the company's board of directors. Although Bob has said he's  mortified and disgusted  at his older brother's behavior, there have been whispers that at heart he's simply Harvey's enabler.  Blood is thicker than water, and maybe that's what the board is thinking as well,  notes a studio exec who's worked for both brothers. Not helping matters for Bob: sexual harassment allegations against him by an executive producer on a TWC TV series.",'This Has Haunted Me': Weinstein Accuser Alleges '70s Rape
"(Apr 13, 2017  6:59 PM CDT) A 12-year-old Chicago boy was waiting for a convenience store to open Tuesday when a car drove by and someone started shooting from it. Older boys who were standing near Adrian Clayton used the preteen and his friends as shields, and he was shot in the chest, according to the report of the incident his parents received from police. One of his friends, also 12, was shot in the leg.  They should be allowed just to go across the street to the store ... without stuff like this happening,  his mother, Krystal Falkner, tells the Chicago Tribune. The family lives in an apartment building across the street from the store in the city's Old Town neighborhood. The boys ran inside the apartment complex after the shooting; Adrian later told his parents he didn't realize he'd been shot until he got back to the complex, father Curtis Clayton says. Both children, and an older man who was also shot in the incident, are in stable condition at local hospitals. Adrian's parents say there aren't enough programs in the neighborhoods to keep kids off the streets, and that's what they blame for the gang activity in the neighborhood.  When it all boils down, the city ain't ever got no money when it come down to the youth, and that’s messed up,  Curtis Clayton says. Something got to give in Chicago. Something have to give.

"(Jan 31, 2015  12:01 PM) More than 2 million Toyota, Chrysler, and Honda vehicles are being recalled for a second fix for faulty air bags that may inadvertently inflate while the car is running. The recall includes some Acura MDX, Dodge Viper, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Honda Odyssey, Pontiac Vibe, Toyota Corolla, and Toyota Avalon models made from 2002 to 2004. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says all of the vehicles covered in today's announcement had already been under a recall for the faulty air bags, but the carmakers' original attempts to fix the defects worked only about 85% of the time. The new recall will fully replace the faulty electronic control unit, which is made by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp of Livonia, Mich. In the previous recall, the unit was only partially replaced. The new remedy will be available to all affected vehicles by the end of the year. However, the NHTSA is urging consumers with cars under the first recall to have the partial unit installed, even if they have to return to the dealer under the second recall. About 39 air bags have inadvertently deployed that had been remedied under the previous recall. The agency says about 1 million Toyota and Honda vehicles involved in the new recalls are also subject to a separate recall related to defective air bags made by Takata Corp. of Japan. Those air bags can deploy and rupture with enough force to cause injury or death.",2M Vehicles Recalled Over Air Bags

Reid said he would not support a bill that taxed federal health benefits, but the alternative may be just as unpopular: an income tax hike on Americans making $250,000 or more. Reid's move to block taxes on health benefits is the largest headache yet for Max Baucus and the bipartisan group seeking to hammer out a compromise on health care. The Nevada senator insisted yesterday that he still wanted a bill with Republican support—a shift from earlier statements chiding Baucus for courting the GOP too much.

Reportedly wearing a hooded sweatshirt and doing his best to remain anonymous, Betts was spotted by Mike Winter, who was exiting a nearby nightclub around 1:45am, according to WEEI.  I didn't know who they were at first,  Winter says of the men distributing food to a line of homeless people. Then he recognized Betts.  I walked up and said hello, because we have a mutual friend, Winter says. Soon, more people began to stream out of the nightclub, and Betts just walked away— no pictures. No nothing,  Winter says, adding that the homeless people, who in turn offered food to the nightclub patrons, didn't even know who had just fed them.

"(Jan 29, 2018  5:33 AM) After she was arrested yet again earlier this month in Chicago for boarding a plane without a ticket,  serial stowaway  Marilyn Hartman was ordered by a Cook County judge to wear an ankle monitor. But because the 66-year-old's home is in a different county, another judge rescinded the monitor Thursday—and warned her three times to stay away from O'Hare and Midway airports, the Chicago Tribune reports. Somewhat predictably, she was arrested again just three days later on Sunday after officers received a call about a woman refusing to leave a part of O'Hare. She was charged with trespassing on state land and a violation of a bail bond and was ordered held without bond until a hearing on Wednesday. Hartman faces felony theft charges from the previous incident, in which she allegedly sneaked onto a British Airways flight and made it all the way to London, where she was sent back to the US for not having proper documentation. Her many previous arrests include multiple failed attempts to get to Hawaii. The Cook County Sheriff's chief policy adviser says Hartman is in  great need of mental health services,  and authorities are working on a  holistic plan  to break the cycle of airport arrests, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

It's not exactly overwhelming (especially in light of the fact that some 70% of emails sent are spam), but spam accounts for one in 200 social media posts, Mashable reports. The findings are based on Nexgate's review of 60 million items from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube from 2011 to 2013; it found Facebook and YouTube are the most spam-heavy networks. And it's  not just in the increase in volume  we should consider, says Nexgate's CEO. There's also been  increasing sophistication and diversification of the mechanisms used to distribute spam.  (One example: An app that promises to show how many Facebookers have viewed your profile that is actually, you guessed it, spam.) And while email anti-spam systems are improving, just 15% of social media spam contains a link that can be auto-flagged as spam.

"(Jul 29, 2014  8:49 AM CDT) An ancient and now rare type of circumcision called metzitzah b'peh, which is sometimes performed by Orthodox Jews on newborn boys, appears to be behind the spread of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to two newborns in New York this month. Both boys were born to mothers who carried full-term and had normal deliveries, reports WNBC-TV. During the ritual, however, the person doing the circumcision uses direct oral suction in an attempt to cleanse the wound, sucking and spitting aside the blood, and the saliva contact can transmit the infection. More than half of American adults have HSV-1, according to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, the most common symptom being oral lesions. Newborns, however, can run high fevers, have seizures, and even die if infected. Since 2000, 16 cases of herpes likely following this type of circumcision have been reported, three in 2014 alone, and there have been two deaths and two instances of brain damage. In a 2012 report, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that circumcision is safe and provides health benefits, but that direct oral suction should be avoided due to risk of infection.

Authorities say Spellman took 10 cartons of cigarettes from a stock room in the store manager's office last December. He was sentenced Friday.

There were conflicting accounts about the identity of the bomber: An examination of the body parts at the scene indicated the bomber was a teenage boy, which is a common finding in suicide bombings in Pakistan, said police. The army also confirmed he was a teenager in a school uniform. But the Pakistani Taliban claimed he was a soldier at the camp in Mardan town who volunteered  to sacrifice his life for Islam.   We accepted his offer and told him to target his fellow soldiers in Mardan,  says a Taliban spokesman.

In Brazil, the over-50 infection rate doubled between 1996 and 2006. Long thought of a  disease of the young people,  HIV is often not considered as a possible diagnosis for more mature patients, leading to delayed screenings.

The violence broke out yesterday after protesters stormed a base belonging to Libya Shield, a grouping of militias tasked with maintaining security. The protesters were demanding that militias leave their camp and submit to the full authority of Libya's security forces. The death toll is likely to increase public backlash against militias, who have been accused of acting with impunity, abusing citizens, and enforcing their own agendas. Libyan officials have provided few details of the clashes. Witnesses say some of the protesters came armed. The camp was believed to house dozens of Libya Shield militiamen, while the protesters who attacked their camp were estimated to number several hundred.

The jobs report was expected to be solid, but not this solid: Unemployment had been expected to rise from 8.6% to 8.7%, and 150,000 new jobs were forecasted, according to the AP.

Keelin O'Neill, who inherited the stamp several years ago from his grandfather, turned it over at the World Stamp Show in New York to the American Philatelic Research Library and collected a $50,000 reward in the process. But the mystery surrounding the Inverted Jenny remains: Who stole it and three other such stamps at a 1955 convention in Virginia? Two of the other stamps were recovered years ago, and the fourth remains missing.  I had no idea about the history and importance of the stamp until very recently,  says O'Neill.  I have to say, it's quite fascinating, and I'm excited to learn more.  A hundred Inverted Jenny stamps were printed in 1918, until someone noticed the error. The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va.

Slate and Salon are featuring excerpts from a new biography of Lewin by Molly Knight Raskin. He was born in Denver, but moved to Israel with his family at age 14, where he attended a technology school and later signed up for the Israeli Defense Force, serving as a commando in an elite counterterrorism unit. He eventually ended up at MIT on a full scholarship, and while there he wrote algorithms to make web content delivery quicker and more efficient.  MIT has a lot of really smart people, and Danny stood out even among that rarified environment,  one of his professors tells CNN. Based on those algorithms, Lewin and that professor founded software company Akamai; he was taking American Airlines Flight 11 to a business meeting on September 11. After the hijacking began, Lewin, 31—who Raskin suggests could have suspected something was amiss before anyone else, because of his IDF training and knowledge of conversational Arabic—got up and struggled with one of the terrorists. Per a 9/11 Commission report issued four years after the attack and based largely on the info two flight attendants relayed to authorities, Satam al-Suqami most likely killed Lewin from behind, by slashing his throat. He died between 8:15am and 8:20am, and the plane slammed into the World Trade Center at 8:46am.  He was the first victim of the first war of the 21st century,  says Lewin's best friend. Akamai, now a multibillion-dollar business, was struggling on September 11—but, Raskin notes, most major news sites managed to stay up and running amid the avalanche of traffic that day because of it.

Google has announced 34 cities in nine metro areas—including San Jose, Atlanta, Nashville, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix—as possible destinations to expand its fiber-optic network, offering lightning-fast Internet and cable.  People are hungrier than ever for faster Internet, and as a result, cities across America are making speed a priority,  the company says, per the Verge. But while Google notes it  genuinely would like to build in all of these cities,  it could choose all, none, or some; teams are first  hitting the road  and  conducting detailed studies  on the local topography and infrastructure, Ars Technica reports. Already at work in Kansas City and Provo, Utah, and with plans for Austin, Texas, and Shawnee, Kansas, Google Fiber's gigabit speeds will likely worry the competition.

"(Jan 9, 2020  6:00 PM) Search-and-rescue teams thought they'd accounted for everyone who was skiing when an avalanche hit a resort in Idaho on Tuesday. But Silver Mountain Resort got a call Wednesday morning saying a family hadn't heard from relative who was there, NBC reports. The search resumed, and on Thursday, crews spotted a body from a helicopter, per Q13. That raised the death toll to three people; four people were injured.  There are no more missing people reported,  the resort posted on Facebook,  and rescue teams are returning to the base.  Three avalanches hit, the sheriff's office said. One skier had just punched a hole for air after being buried by the first avalanche when there was a second.  Just this rush of weight and snow came over, covered the hole that I had cleared for air,  Bill Fuzak said, adding that he then heard  this sick sound of everything coming to a stop.  Eventually, he passed out.  Next thing I knew, I felt snow being brushed away from my face and I heard voices.  He'd been in the snow for about 50 minutes.

As Gawker reports, Mita Diran, who had worked for the company since May of last year, tweeted regularly about her epic workdays, posting this on Saturday:  30 hours of working and still going strooong.  What came next: heart failure, a coma, death. Buzzfeed and Gawker are basing their reporting on local reports, with Buzzfeed citing a post from a supposed employee of Diran's father, who placed the blame on  too much Kratingdaeng  (the original Red Bull), writing that it  attacks her heart.

Authorities believe more bodies could be buried at the Hulene garbage dump on the outskirts of Maputo, per the AP. The garbage in the poor, densely populated area where the disaster happened rose to the height of a three-story building, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa. Lusa and Radio Mocambique both reported 17 deaths. Half a dozen homes were destroyed and some residents in the area fled for fear of another collapse.  The mountains of garbage collapsed on the houses and many families were still inside these residences,  Fatima Belchoir, a national disaster official, told Lusa. Authorities are trying to help people who lost their homes, she said. The Hulene garbage dump is the largest such facility in Maputo.

"(Feb 8, 2017  2:40 PM) Spinal Tap is getting back together ... over a lawsuit. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Rob Reiner have joined Harry Shearer in his lawsuit against entertainment group Vivendi, which acquired the rights to This Is Spinal Tap in 1989, the Guardian reports. The four men created the rock mockumentary together; Reiner directed and narrated it while the other three played the members of the titular band. Shearer sued Vivendi last year, alleging that the firm—Universal Music's parent company—has been hiding profits from the film in order to avoid giving the film's creators what they're due. Between 1989 and 2006, music and merchandise related to the film has raked up  tens of millions of dollars  in revenue, per the suit, but Vivendi only reported total income of $98 from soundtrack sales and $81 from merch sales. Shearer was originally suing for $125 million; with the three others joining him, it's now a $400 million lawsuit. Their attorney tells the Hollywood Reporter the others didn't learn they were being  defrauded  until Shearer filed his suit.  What makes this case so egregious is the prolonged and deliberate concealment of profit and the purposeful manipulation of revenue allocation between various Vivendi subsidiaries—to the detriment of the creative talent behind the band and film,  Reiner says in a statement.  Such anti-competitive practices need to be exposed. I am hoping this lawsuit goes to 11.  That, of course, refers to the  These go to 11  scene in the film.

While HIV is up 33% from 2013 to 2014 and gonorrhea is up 30%, syphilis skyrocketed a whopping 79%. Why the sudden uptick? Officials cite better testing, but add that hookup apps like Tinder are at least partly to blame.  High-risk behaviors include using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters, having sex without a condom, having multiple sex partners, and having sex while under the influence of drugs or alcohol,  the department said in a statement, adding that gay and bisexual men, African Americans, Hispanics, and young adults are the most affected by these growing rates.  These data send a clear signal that despite the progress we have made in reducing STDs and HIV over the years, there is more work to do,  one official tells the East Greenwich Patch. Rhode Island officials say the stats are reflective of a national trend. A study from 2013 out of New York University blamed Craigslist for a 16% increase in HIV cases between 1999 and 2008 across much of the country, while the hookup app Grindr, which is primarily used by gay men, was blamed on playing a role in at least half of all syphilis cases in New Zealand in 2012, reports Fox News.

"(Oct 15, 2014  2:04 AM CDT) Some rare good news in the fight against climate change: Plants are an even greater ally than we knew, absorbing around 16% more carbon than previously thought, according to new research. University of Texas researchers took a fresh look at climate models and at how CO2 is absorbed by plants, analyzing the way it spreads inside leaves, reports the BBC.  There is a time lag between scientists who study fundamental processes and modellers who model those processes in a large-scale model,  says one of the authors of the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers say the findings could help clear up some discrepancies in current climate models. The findings suggest  it will be slightly easier to fulfill the target of keeping global warming below 2 degrees—but with a big emphasis on 'slightly,'  says a climate modeler at Britain's Center for Ecology and Hydrology, explaining that emission cuts in the next few decades  will still have to be very large  to hit that target. An energy systems analyst at Melbourne University agrees that cuts are still vital. A larger carbon turnover in plants doesn't necessarily mean greater carbon storage, he tells the Australian,  in the same way that larger cash turnover in a business does not necessarily result in larger profits.

The kids were rescued along with two women, while 300 gang members were arrested, reports the Xinhua news agency, per AFP. Kidnappers stole children in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, then handed them off to deliverymen who would take them to other regions to be sold, according to the report. The bust happened two weeks ago, with local cops simultaneously hitting 11 different locations, but was only announced today. A gender imbalance due to China's one-child policy means kidnapped women are often sold in remote areas where men are unable to find wives, Reuters reports. The policy also means some families will pay money for a male child if they can't conceive one on their own, reports Al Jazeera. Other kids may be sold to international adoption agencies.

The family said in a statement late Saturday that the novelist had died at his London home. The writer's wife, Nadira Naipaul, said he  died surrounded by those he loved having lived a life which was full of wonderful creativity and endeavor.  Born in Trinidad on Aug. 17, 1932, Naipaul studied at Oxford University and published his first novel, The Mystic Masseur, in 1957.

"(Oct 15, 2019  8:22 AM CDT) No dead of night needed for this art heist: A thief sauntered into a San Francisco gallery in the middle of the afternoon, lifted a famous Salvador Dali piece worth $20,000, and walked right back out, all in just over 30 seconds, per KGO. The framed mid-'60s etching titled  Burning Giraffe  was on an easel at the front of Dennis Rae Fine Art's show floor, with Rasjad Hopkins, the gallery's director, working a solo shift, when the theft happened around 4:30pm Sunday, reports CBS San Francisco. Hopkins says he turned his back for just a second, and when he turned back around, the rare artwork was gone. He hadn't seen the suspect, and he tells Time that the gallery's camera wasn't on, but surveillance cameras from neighboring businesses caught a man in a blue T-shirt and hat walking away from the gallery with the etching in hand. One of the cameras also spotted what appears to be a female accomplice who hovered outside the gallery's front door while the male suspect did the heavy lifting inside. KGO notes the etching normally would've been secured to the easel with a lock and tether, leading to speculation on whether the thief was able to quickly cut the cable while in the gallery. But Hopkins thinks that during a showing the day before, the tether had been removed and perhaps not reattached before the gallery opened on Sunday.  I think it was a theft of opportunity,  he tells Time. Gallery workers say the piece is well known and numbered, so it's unlikely anyone would be able to easily sell it online without attracting notice.  It's a very hot item,  one employee tells KGO. Anyone with information on the theft is encouraged to call local police.",Thief Strolls Out of Gallery With $20K Dali Etching
"(Sep 3, 2019  2:22 AM CDT) At least 25 people have now been confirmed dead in a horrific fire on a diving boat off southern California early Monday. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll says the search will continue overnight for nine people still missing in one of the worst maritime disasters in the state's history, the AP reports. Kroll says five bodies that have been located have not been recovered because of unsafe conditions under the Conception, which sank in around 60 feet of water as fire crews were fighting the blaze. Authorities say the fire broke out around 3am while the boat was anchored off Santa Cruz Island. Five out of six crew members escaped and sought help from a nearby fishing boat, but the 33 passengers were below deck, with only one narrow staircase out.  You couldn't ask for a worse situation,  Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters Monday. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said late Monday that the search for survivors would continue overnight, reports Reuters.  It’s a very tragic event and we will search all the way through the night, into the morning,  she said.  But I think we should all be prepared to move into the worst outcome.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein called for a full investigation, saying it was  inconceivable  that a fire on a boat could be so deadly  with all the safety regulations we have in place today,  the Orange County Register reports.  We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception,  she said.  And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.

"(Dec 17, 2018  10:35 AM) Having trouble keeping track of the blizzard of headlines about investigations involving President Trump? A new list compiled by Garrett M. Graff of Wired might explain why: Graff tallies up no fewer than 17 separate investigations currently underway.  Trump faces a legal assault unlike anything previously seen by any president,  writes Graff, a sentiment the president would likely agree with, given his frequent railings about a  witch hunt.  This isn't just Robert Mueller, however. Graff counts seven different sets of prosecutors and investigators and lists the cases in New York, DC, and Virginia. Intriguingly, he also writes of a  Mystery Investigation Underway by Unknown Office.  The latter refers to redacted information revolving around Michael Flynn, which  could be one of the other investigations mentioned here, could represent another as-yet-unknown unfolding criminal case, or could be a counterintelligence investigation that will never become public,  writes Graff. He provides snapshots and status reports on all the investigations, from Russia's election meddling, to WikiLeaks, to taxes, to campaign finance irregularities, etc.  Potentially the biggest unseen aspect of Mueller's investigation is his year-long pursuit of Middle Eastern influence targeting the Trump campaign,  writes Graff.

"(Nov 27, 2012  10:44 AM) So, where does Hurricane Sandy fall on the scale of recent disasters? Somewhere above Katrina, at least according to Andrew Cuomo.  Hurricane Katrina, in many ways, was not as impactful as Hurricane Sandy, believe it or not,  the New York governor said.  Because of the density of New York, the number of people affected, the number of properties affected was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than Hurricane Katrina.  Still,  Katrina had a human toll that thankfully we have not paid in this region.  Katrina was to blame for 1,866 deaths; Sandy was responsible for about 100, the New York Post notes. Sandy, however, damaged some 305,000 homes and 265,300 businesses, while Katrina hit 214,700 homes and 18,700 businesses. Cuomo put the storm's damage, plus the cost of preparations for future storms, at $42 billion. The comparison between storms  puts the entire conversation ... in focus,  says Cuomo—but is the comparison valid? It's dicey at best, according to many on Twitter, as well as Connor Simpson at the Atlantic Wire.

Mia McLeod, who pre-filed legislation Thursday designed to drive a point home about women's reproductive rights. To wit: She's attempting to make it as hard for men to get erectile dysfunction drugs as it is for women to get an abortion, NBC News reports. Under her bill, a man attempting to obtain Viagra or Cialis would need to undergo a 24-hour waiting period after getting the script; undergo an exam by a sex therapist to rule out  psychological conditions;  take regular stress tests to ensure he's healthy enough for sex; produce a notarized affidavit from a sex partner who can back up his ED claims; and go to at least three sessions of outpatient counseling, where he'd be encouraged to  pursue celibacy as a viable lifestyle choice.  McLeod, a Democrat, tells WCBD that, after being irked by anti-abortion bills that get filed regularly, she was inspired to show male colleagues what it was like to have their reproductive rights in the crosshairs. South Carolina is one of several states that has been investigating its abortion clinics (it has three) after the Planned Parenthood imbroglio, the Savannah Morning News reports. Not that McLeod is hopeful this bill will sail through.  I don't think it'll pass,  she tells WCBD.  We're in a male-dominated legislature … and I really just want to broaden the discussion and get people thinking about ... the issues that women face who are seeking legal abortion services in this state.

Today, the governor of Okinawa finally gave the go-ahead for landfill work to begin on the island's coast, where the new facilities will be built. The Washington Post reports that Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima's OK ends an impasse born out of local opposition; PM Shinzo Abe ultimately dangled a big carrot: a spending package that would see Japan's poorest prefecture get $2.9 billion a year through fiscal 2021. Still, the AP notes Nakaima later told a news conference that he would continue pressing to move the Futenma troops off Okinawa entirely, saying  my thinking remains it would be fastest to relocate outside (Okinawa) prefecture to a place where there is already an airport.  It's expected that it will take about a decade to build the new base, which will feature two runways that measure more than a mile in length each. But the approval could still run up against court challenges and protests. Says a politician in the city where the new base will be constructed,  Residents who are opposed will surely resort to the use of force, such as blocking roads to stop this from happening.","17 Years Later, Okinawa OKs Relocation of US Base"

A local union says the factory has installed swipe card systems on its bathrooms to time potty breaks, slapping employees with disciplinary measures if they exceed the allotted time, CNNMoney reports. Hit  60 minutes or more over the last 10 working days  and you're in trouble, Teamsters local 743 argues in a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The union says some 19 workers were unfairly disciplined in June alone.  There have been meetings with workers and human resources where the workers had to explain what they were doing in the bathroom,  a union rep says. WaterSaver's CEO, Steve Kersten, says the policy came about because some employees were spending too much time on the toilet: More than 120 hours of production were lost in May due to bathroom visits, he says, noting employees should be able to do their business during regular breaks, which total one hour per day. Don't use the bathroom at all while on the clock? You'll be rewarded with $1 per day, thrown on a gift card at the end of the month, Kersten says.

"(Mar 20, 2019  1:55 PM CDT) The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday and projected no rate hikes in 2019, dramatically underscoring its plan to be  patient  about any further increases. The Fed announced that it was keeping its benchmark rate—which can influence everything from mortgages to credit cards to home equity lines of credit—in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. It also said it will stop shrinking its bond portfolio in September, a step that should help hold down long-term interest rates. Together, the moves signal no major increases in borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. Some analysts believe the next rate move could be a cut later this year if the economy slows as much as some fear it might, reports the AP. In signaling no rate increases at all this year, the Fed's policymakers reduced their forecast from two that were previously predicted in December. They now project one rate hike in 2020 and none in 2021. The Fed's pause in credit tightening is a response, in part, to slowdowns in the US and global economies. It says that while the job market remains strong,  growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Fed officials expect economic growth of just 2.1% this year, down from its previous projection of 2.3% growth.

The Guardian and New York Times report a $41 million, 10-year deal has been struck between trustees for the famous Roman Catholic church and the city council so that the structure—whose name means  holy family,  per Reuters—can get the licensing paperwork from the city, which it's never had, that it needs to be completed. The money paid out to the city, which People notes is the amount accrued over all these years in fees from lacking the proper permits, will help fund improvements to transportation services there. Work began on the massive church in 1882, and the Times explains that a building permit was acquired in the town it was then located in: Sant Marti de Provencals. But that town was eventually absorbed into Barcelona, and city authorities there apparently never issued a new permit. To complicate things, Antoni Gaudi, the Catalan architect behind the building's design, died in 1926 after being hit by a tram, with only about 25% of the structure complete. Officials hope that with all the red tape about to be moved out of the way, the structure, which is about two-thirds done, could be finished by 2026, the century anniversary of Gaudi's death.

"(May 22, 2018  7:12 AM CDT) For nearly half a century, a publication started by Andy Warhol has been publishing Q&As with such celebrities as John Lennon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and even Warhol himself. Now, in what CNNMoney calls a  painfully familiar  story for those in media, staffers at Interview have taken to Twitter to announce the magazine's demise. One of those employees, editor Ezra Marcus, tells CNN that staffers were brought into a meeting and told both the print and online editions were being shuttered  effective immediately  and that the company is declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 7. Interview Inc. confirmed that in a statement to Artnet, noting,  The Company has been operating at a financial loss … (and) did not believe its financial condition would improve in the foreseeable future.  Warhol started Interview in 1969, and it was taken over by businessman and art collector Peter Brant, described as one of Warhol's friends, in 1989, two years after Warhol had died, per the Washington Post. The Cut reports the magazine has been plagued with troubles of late: There've been recent high-level departures—including that of the publication's ex-creative director, Karl Templer, who's been accused of sexual misconduct—and several former staffers claimed the magazine owed them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Another friend says Warhol's initial motivation for the magazine was because he'd been denied tickets for the New York Film Festival and figured if he had a magazine he could get press passes.  This really is the end of an era,  Marcus tweeted. (A UK tourist bought a $2 million Warhol painting at a garage sale for $5.)","After Nearly 50 Years, Andy Warhol's Interview Shutters"

Fire officials in New London, Conn., said they were called to a burning waterfront home at 3:34am on Nov. 18, where they had to force their way inside to remove Hseih and begin CPR; he suffered burns and smoke inhalation. He died Friday. Hsieh was the Harvard-educated son of Taiwanese immigrants who stumbled onto Zappos, saw it through the dot-com bust, and eventually sold it to Amazon for $1 billion in 2009. He continued to run it as a standalone division until he retired from the company in August. Over at Inc.com, Bill Murphy Jr. remembers Hseih for his two-word employment policy:  The offer.  Basically, after a short time on the job, employees could choose to stay or go. If they chose the latter, Zappos would pay them to leave.  It wasn't altruism,  writes Murphy.

"(Oct 1, 2016  7:58 AM CDT) A woman who says her relatives had no choice but to sell a Picasso when fleeing the Nazis in 1938 wants New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art to hand over the painting—or pay more than $100 million in damages. Laurel Zuckerman is the great-grandniece of German Jewish businessman Paul Leffmann, who sold the 1904-5 work The Actor for $13,200, the Times of Israel reports. Leffmann and his wife had fled Nazi Germany for Fascist Italy the previous year. According to a lawsuit filed in New York on Friday, they sold the Picasso they had bought in 1912 at a discount to fund their escape to Switzerland. It was donated to the Met in 1952 by Chrysler heiress Thelma Foy. A lawyer for Zuckerman, who administers the Leffmann estate, says the painting  is tainted by the history of the Holocaust, and the Leffmanns, given the circumstances under which they sold it, never lost title,  Reuters reports. The New York Times reports that the museum says it has  indisputable title  to the painting and will fight the lawsuit. The museum says the price dealers in Paris paid for the Picasso was fair market value at the time and notes that the Leffmanns, who settled in Switzerland after the war, reclaimed some of the property they had been forced to sell but did not make a claim on the painting.

"(Jul 27, 2013  3:48 PM CDT) Police have identified the now-dead gunman they say was behind the death of six people in a South Florida shooting spree as Pedro Vargas, 42, reports NBC Miami. At a press conference today, authorities also named five of the six victims: Italo Pisciotti, 79, Camira Pisciotti, 69, Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33, Patricio Simono, 64, and Merly S. Niebles, 51. The sixth victim was identified only as a 17-year-old female, though relatives have said she was Niebles' daughter, Priscilla Perez. Vargas was a tenant of the Hialeah apartment complex where the shooting took place. It was previously reported that the killings began when the Pisciottis, the building's managers, came to question the gunman over a tenant dispute. But the police say it was more than that: Vargas had lit his fourth-floor apartment on fire, and they went to investigate the smoke coming out of it. When the couple came to the door, police say, Vargas shot them. As firefighters arrived on scene, Vargas fired at them from his balcony, but instead hit Gavilanes, who was walking across the street with his son, reports the Miami Herald. Vargas then went into a third-floor apartment, where the bodies of Simono, Niebles, and the 17-year-old were later found.

"(Jan 24, 2020  10:32 AM)  Every Egyptian hoped that after death their soul would be able to speak,  says University of York Egyptologist Joann Fletcher—who just sort of made that happen, at least for one 3,000-year-old Egyptian. But the priest who served under Rameses XI didn't confess of a good life so that his soul could  pass through into eternity  as he surely would have hoped. Instead, his mummy uttered something like  eeuuughhh,  per the Guardian. (Listen for yourself here.) Researchers created the sound using a 3D-printed reproduction of the vocal tract of the priest Nesyamun, who died in his mid-50s. They attached the model to an electronic larynx to reproduce the  sound that would come out of his vocal tract if he was in his coffin and his larynx came to life again,  says researcher David Howard of the University of London, per the New York Times. Scientific American (which has much detail on the process) explains that as sound passed through the artificial vocal tract, what was heard was a vowel sound that falls between the vowels in  bed  and  bad.  Howard suggests Nesyamun spoke in a slightly higher pitch than that of an average modern man. However, the sound produced isn't exactly how Nesyamun would have sounded, thanks to a mix of factors ranging from the absence of real vocal folds to the fact that his throat was at rest. But the researchers think their work could help make museum exhibits more  multidimensional.  (Last year, Egypt unearthed mummified animals, including lion cubs.)",What Did the 3K-Year-Old Mummy Say?

AirAsia, a regional low-cost carrier based in Malaysia, said the missing Airbus A320 was on its submitted flight plan route. However, it had requested permission to deviate because of weather.  We don't dare to presume what has happened except that it has lost contact,  said Indonesia's acting director general of transportation. He said the last contact between the pilot and air traffic control was at 6:13am local time when the pilot asked to go up to 34,000 feet, apparently to avoid stormy weather. It was last seen on radar at 6:16am, and a minute later was no longer there, he said. Darkness has fallen in the region, reports the BBC, and the search has been called off for the night. It will resume in the morning. He said there was no distress signal from Flight QZ8501. The contact was lost about 42 minutes after the single-aisle jetliner took off from Indonesia's Surabaya airport. It still had about an hour to go before arriving in Singapore. The plane had seven crew and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, said the general manager of Surabaya's Juanda airport. There were six foreigners—three South Koreans, including the infant, and one each from Singapore, Britain, and Malaysia. The rest were Indonesians.

"(Jul 12, 2018  11:15 AM CDT) Much was made of NASA's announcement last month that  building blocks of life  had been found on Mars. But new research suggests the same organic molecules may actually have been discovered by Viking landers NASA sent to Mars in 1976—and then accidentally burned, New Scientist reports. The landers' main instrument was a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, which used heat in an attempt to find organic matter. But scientists now know that due to a chemical in the soil on Mars, that process would have destroyed anything organic. At the time, scientists were  shocked  when the Viking landers reported finding nothing organic, USA Today reports.  It was just completely unexpected and inconsistent with what we knew,  a NASA scientist explains, per Space.com. Small, carbon-rich meteorites frequently hit Mars, so researchers had long assumed there would be organic matter on the planet. When scientists discovered perchlorate, a salt that's explosive under high temperatures, in Mars soil, they realized what might have happened during the 1976 mission. The new study corroborates the idea of the Viking landers possibly discovering and then destroying organic matter, but it doesn't conclusively prove it.",NASA May Have Torched 'Building Blocks of Life' on Mars in 1976

Per Bloomberg, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia awarded Warmbier's family $450 million in punitive damages plus pain and suffering and medical costs incurred after Warmbier was returned from the DPRK in a comatose state in 2017 following his arrest during a visit for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel. Earlier this year, Warmbier's parents accused the regime in Pyongyang of torturing and killing their son and sought a staggering $1.05 billion in punitive damages.

So what are the chances of the Warmbiers collecting their enormous sum? Not too good, an attorney who has handled similar cases tells the Enquirer.

Now, they're apparently pointing the finger at North Korea. While investigators believe Chinese individuals or businesses carried out the attack, they suspect North Korea directed  one of the biggest bank robberies of modern times,  sources tell the Wall Street Journal. Officials confirmed that theory, per Reuters. Sources say investigators have linked the code used in the robbery to the 2014 Sony hack, which the FBI previously blamed on North Korea. Private security researchers have also said both attacks used similar code and techniques.  If that linkage is true, that means a nation-state is robbing banks,  says Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the National Security Agency.  That is a big deal; it's different.  Some, however, say the hackers of the New York Fed—who may be responsible for similar attacks against banks in Ecuador and Vietnam—could have altered code from the Sony attack, which the US government later released, meaning there may be no link to North Korea at all.

So writes Mark Penn, a pollster and adviser to the Clintons from 1995 to 2008, in an op-ed co-authored with Andrew Stein, president of the New York City Council. Their premise is that Clinton will return to the Hillary Clinton of old,  the universal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand of 1994.  Think of it as  Hillary Clinton 4.0.  In earlier iterations, version 2.0 lost to Barack Obama as a centrist and version 3.0 lost to Donald Trump after blowing it with white, middle-class voters.

"(May 16, 2020  11:00 AM CDT) Noma wasn't affordable to most earthlings—until now. The innovative and expensive Danish restaurant is reopening next week with a whole new menu costing just $15 a person, the LA Times reports. In other words, Noma is ditching its roughly $400 meals (think dried fruit stuffed with pollen, or cod bladder cooked in quince) for simple burger-and-drink fare.  We were like, 'Should we do an ant marinade with raw carrots to have that twist of who we are?'  says chef-owner René Redzepi.  But then I'm like, 'No, why should we do that right now?' It's about being together, it's not about trying to be innovative.  What's more, reservations will be unavailable and diners will have to sit outside on picnic blankets. As Redzepi tells the Wall Street Journal,  We will open as a kind of wine bar.  The Thursday reopening will be Noma's first business since it closed March 14 in response to the coronavirus, Eater notes. But it's not facing extinction: The Danish government has covered Noma's fixed costs for the first two months and up to 80% for the next two, and Redzepi managed to get a bank loan. So he's been able to keep his full 85-person staff and give them free meals to boot.  One thing that has surprised me: how strongly hit restaurants are in America and how bad it seems,  he tells the Times.  People are running out of money in one week, two weeks, and that's pretty heavy to watch.  But Noma still faces an uncertain future and slim 3% profit margin after taxes.  That is sort of the same [for restaurants] all over the world,  he says.",World's 'Best Restaurant' Has a New Menu—for $15

Many of the dead were members of local Sahwa, or Awakening Councils—one of several names for the Sunni fighters who changed the course of the war when they revolted against al-Qaeda in Iraq and joined the Americans in late 2006 and 2007. An army official said many of the victims were brutalized  beyond recognition.  At least seven people were found alive, bound with handcuffs. It's not uncommon for Awakening Councils members to be targeted for revenge by al-Qaeda, but the scope of this killing is unusual.",Uniformed Men Execute 24 Sunnis in Baghdad
"(Aug 25, 2010  1:20 AM CDT) The United Nations has launched an investigation into reports that close to 200 women and baby boys were gang raped over a series of days by Congolese rebels and Rwandan fighters—just a few miles from a UN outpost.  The secretary-general is outraged by the rape and assault,  a UN spokesman tells the BBC.  This is another grave example of both the level of sexual violence and the insecurity that continue to plague Congo.  An official in charge of peacekeeping and an expert on sexual violence in conflict have been assigned to lead the probe. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been called the rape capital of the world, with more than 8,000 women raped during fighting last year.","UN Probes Congo Rapes of 200 Women, Baby Boys"
"(Feb 14, 2011  7:53 AM) The White House expects the national budget deficit to peak at $1.65 trillion this year, or roughly 10.9% of GDP—its highest level since World War II, the Wall Street Journal reports. That figure—which is significantly more pessimistic than the Congressional Budget Office’s $1.48 trillion estimate—comes alongside Obama’s newly released $3.73 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2012, which the administration says would shave $1.1 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. Under Obama’s plan, the deficit would shrink to $1.1 trillion in 2012, and to around $600 billion a year thereafter through 2018. The budget would cut funding on a host of programs long-championed by Democrats, and raise taxes on the rich and corporations, the Washington Post reports. At the same time, it would boost spending on education, energy and medical research, and high-speed internet infrastructure. It's a revealing look at Obama's priorities, but odds are it'll be all but ignored on Capitol Hill, as Republicans push much larger cuts in a House vote this week.",Obama: Deficit to Hit $1.6T
"(Jan 23, 2009  10:14 AM) Recently-axed Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain may have steered his company to a $15.4 billion fourth-quarter loss, but he did so from a really nice office. Details are emerging about Thain's $1.2 million redecoration, Bloomberg reports. Among the purchases noted by CNBC: $87,000 for area rugs, $68,000 for a 19th-century credenza, $35,000 for a  commode on legs,  $28,000 for curtains, $25,000 for a pedestal table, and $1,400 for a wastebasket. Of the $1.2 million, $837,000 went to Michael Smith, the same interior decorator Barack Obama has tapped to make over the White House. Much of the rest was spent on the antiques, which have likely retained their value if Merrill wants its money back, says one furniture seller. Besides, he says, considering the money his company lost, complaining about $1.2 million  is a little like noting that somebody failed to turn on his blinker before driving into a train.",Commode for 35K?

"(Apr 27, 2015  12:30 AM CDT) Election officials in Kazakhstan say preliminary results of yesterday's nationwide polls show the long-ruling president confirming his incumbency with 97.7% of the vote. A crushing victory for 74-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev was widely expected from the moment Sunday's snap elections were announced. Nazarbayev faced only two nominal rivals, and state media have for years nurtured an increasingly extravagant cult of personality devoted to him. Authorities in the oil-rich Central Asian nation, which is facing a slowdown in economic growth amid falling oil prices and recession in neighboring Russia, say they hope the election will serve as a confirmation of legitimacy in uncertain times. The Central Election Commission says turnout was a record 95%. The high turnout came despite what international observers described as a  hardly visible  campaign. Voter turnout is typically high in authoritarian states in Central Asia—the result of habit carried over from Soviet times and massive marshaling exercises by state officials. Nazarbayev's victory over his two rivals, a trade union official and a Communist politician who ran on a platform that included supporting Nazarbayev, was seen as all but a formality. Nazarbayev hails the scale of the turnout.  Without such mass public confidence, it would be difficult to work on completing the difficult tasks at hand,  he says.  The record turnout showed the unity of the people of Kazakhstan and their desire to live in a stable state.",Opposition Scores 2% in Kazakhstan Election

The West Memphis Three—Damien Echols, 36, Jason Baldwin, 34, and Jessie Misskelley, 36—actually pleaded guilty to the killings and will get out based on time served. A rarely-used law allowed them to maintain their innocence in the high-profile case, which drew supporters such as Johnny Depp, Eddie Vedder, and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks to their side. Echols had been on death row. The men say they were convicted of murdering three 8-year-old boys in 1993 as part of a satanic ritual because police coerced a confession out of Misskelley, who the Appeal says is thought to be mentally challenged.  If you go through with this, you're going to open Pandora's Box,  the father of one of the young victims shouted to the judge as the deal was being read.  You're wrong, Your Honor.

More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation,  read the tweet. Politico notes that the tweet failed to mention that the AP's analysis of Clinton meetings looked only at discretionary meetings and not meetings with federal officials or representatives of foreign governments, which tend to make up the majority of any secretary of state's meetings.  The tweet fell short of AP standards by omitting essential context,  AP VP for Standards John Daniszewski writes in a blog post, setting out a new policy for removing tweets, an action that the AP used to see as  retroactively editing a conversation.  Clinton and her campaign slammed the tweet and the Clinton Foundation story soon after it appeared, USA Today reports.  It draws a conclusion and makes a suggestion that my meetings with people like the late, great Elie Wiesel or Melinda Gates or the Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus were somehow due to connections with the foundation instead of their status as highly respected global leaders,  Clinton told CNN last month.","After 2 Weeks, AP Deletes Clinton Foundation Tweet"

Authorities say the first victim, a 13-year-old girl, was attacked at around 4:40pm yesterday and lost her left arm below the elbow, as well as suffered severe damage to her left leg, NBC News reports. Not much more than an hour later, a 16-year-old was attacked around 2 miles away and lost his left arm below the shoulder, reports WECT, which gives the age of the first victim as 12. Both victims are now in stable condition after surgery, authorities say. Oak Island's town manager says helicopters will patrol the coastline and beaches will be open today, NBC reports. He says visitors will be encouraged to stay out of the water, though few are likely to need encouragement: Witnesses to the aftermath of the first attack tell the AP it was  nightmarish  and  like a scene from Jaws.

"(Feb 29, 2016  7:28 AM) An Australian man has been sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of the attempted murder of someone who was already dead, Stuff.co.nz reports. In March 2014, Rocky Matskassy, 31, was shot as he and Daniel James Darrington, 39, struggled over a gun in a home in a Melbourne suburb, the Guardian reports. As Matskassy lay on the ground, the drunken Darrington shot him twice more in the head.  I started to panic,  Darrington later told a psychologist.  I didn't know what to do. He was twitching and I felt sorry for him. I shot him twice, mate. I wish it had never happened.  The movements Darrington describes could have been involuntary, post-death responses. The case was new legal territory for both the prosecution and defense.  If Matskassy dies as a consequence of the first shot, the subsequent deliberate shots into Matskassy are not murder,  the defense lawyer argued during the trial. A jury found Darrington not guilty of murder in October, instead finding him guilty of attempted murder. The prosecutor had claimed that Darrington shot Matskassy three times at point-blank range after trying to evict Matskassy from his friend's house, where Matskassy had been living for several months, reports the Age.

We looked at her writing and were just stunned to see how well her handwriting was,  the competition's director tells ABC News. CNN reports 7-year-old Anaya Ellick was born without hands and has so far foregone prosthetics.  Anaya is a remarkable young lady,  says her principal at Greenbrier Christian Academy, Tracy Cox.

"(Nov 20, 2011  6:41 AM) Despite Pakistan's religious extremism and violence, a new Christian church, the largest in Pakistan, has just opened in Karachi, reports the AP. St. Peter's of Karachi, which opened on Nov. 9, is a domed, three-story building in the heart of a sprawling slum in Pakistan's largest city, big enough for 5,000 worshippers at a time. At a staggering cost of $3.8 million, with funds raised from around the world, St. Peter's symbolizes the resiliency of a religion that has come under increasing persecution from the state and militant groups over the past decade, say church leaders.  There were so many people here it was not possible for us to accommodate them on Sundays,  said Father Saleh Diego.  Some were sitting at the back, some in the corner, some on the terrace.  Christians account for only around 3% to 5% of Pakistan's 180 million people, and are mostly former Hindus drawn from the lowest castes. Because most churches in Pakistan are built in the country's poorest neighborhoods, Christian leaders say they actually attract few threats from Muslims.","In Karachi Slum, a 5K-Seat Megachurch"

One other leading theory: All eight lived at the same nursing facility and might have consumed something there that made them ill, reports KTVU. As of Monday, all but one of the five hospitalized patients had been released. Those who fell ill were among more than 800 people who attended a dinner hosted by a local church at an American Legion hall in the San Francisco suburb. So far, no others appear to have fallen ill, and health authorities have not yet identified what sickened the eight, who began experiencing nausea the following day. Some of the food was prepared on site and some was donated.  They could have gotten sick from the food they prepared at their living facility,  says a health official with Contra Costa County, per the Los Angeles Times.  At this point, we have no reason to conclude it was the food at the event.  In fact, another charity dinner went on as scheduled Monday at the American Legion facility. The father of a 41-year-old mentally disabled man tells the San Francisco Chronicle that his son, who resides at a group home, remains hospitalized with kidney failure after eating the Thanksgiving meal.

NASA's Constellation program, designed to return people to the moon, was canceled earlier this year by President Obama. But lawmakers inserted language into the budget to protect jobs in their home states requiring continued funding. Because a new budget was not passed in October, NASA must continue to pay for the canceled Ares I rocket development until at least March, at a cost of $95 million per month. NASA claims that the Ares I money is not all waste—much of the rocket research could be applicable to a next-generation heavy-lift rocket design, if the agency chooses to use that design.

"(Jul 4, 2016  4:18 AM CDT) Iraqi authorities on Monday raised the death toll to 142 from Sunday's devastating truck bombing at a bustling Baghdad commercial street as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered new security measures. The bombing, claimed by ISIS, was the deadliest terror attack in Iraq in a year and one of the worst single bombings in more than a decade of war and insurgency, the AP reports. It underscored the militants' ability to strike the Iraqi capital despite a string of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country and fueled public anger toward the political leadership. The suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden vehicle in Baghdad's mostly Shiite Karada district, a favorite avenue for shoppers—especially during the holy month of Ramadan, with the streets and sidewalks filled with young people and families after they had broken their daylight fast. Police and health officials said Monday the toll stood at 142, with 185 wounded, but it is likely to increase even further as rescuers are still looking for missing people. Hours after the bombing, al-Abadi visited the attack site, but a furious mob surrounded his convoy, yelling expletives, hurling rocks and shoes at the prime minister's cars, and calling him a  thief.  In a statement issued later Sunday, al-Abadi ordered that a scandal-ridden bomb detection device be pulled from service.

Instead, he lived a full life that came to an end last Thursday at age 91 due to kidney failure, reports the New Jersey Record. The last Jewish survivor from the Polish town of Szadek, Peck was liberated in 1945 before marrying another Holocaust survivor and moving to New Jersey, where he eventually bought an upholstery business. But he was frustrated  that the American citizens he met did not have an inkling of the horrors which Holocaust survivors had experienced at the hands of the Nazis,  author Maya Ross wrote in the recent biography Abe-vs-Adolf.  The American Jews didn’t believe us ... the way they killed us, the way they treated us. They didn’t want to hear a word about it. It was too terrible for them to believe so we shut up. I shut up for years.  That eventually ended, and to raise awareness, Peck began speaking at schools and community functions. He was later invited to talk at colleges across the US and Europe, according to his obituary.  He felt if he survived, he could tell people about the horrors the Nazis perpetrated,  his son says. He wanted people  not to stand for any injustice in the world. That was a core piece of his legacy.

Instead, two of them will sit on an NIH board that approves all studies of so-called  HeLa cells.  The agreement triggered the release of a new study that closely analyzes Lacks' DNA and may show how she got cancer.

"(Aug 23, 2010  5:33 PM CDT) Congolese and Rwandan rebels continue to sow terror across eastern Congo, holding an entire town hostage earlier this month and gang-raping nearly 200 women and baby boys, the AP reports. The violence occurred only a few miles from a base of UN peacekeepers, but the force of 25 was unable to stop the 200 to 400 rebels:  When the peacekeepers approached a village, the rebels would run into the forest, but then the Blue Helmets had to move on to another area, and the rebels would just return,  a local leader said. Because of this strategy, there were no casualties or gunfighting—just four days of  lots of pillaging and the systematic raping of women,  said Will Cragin of the International Medical Corps. Cragin said aid workers could only reach the victims when the rebels withdrew of their own accord—and by then it was too late to administer anti-HIV medication to all but three. At least 179 women and four boys aged 1 month, six months, a year, and 18 months were raped.  We keep going back and identifying more and more cases,  says Cragin.","Nearly 200 Women, Boys Raped in Congo"
"(Dec 12, 2015  1:39 PM) Two weeks after climate talks started in Paris, negotiators made history and did something that will  save the world,  Wired reports. According to Gizmodo, 195 countries signed a climate pact on Saturday to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. In two decades of climate conferences, this is the first to end in a successful agreement.  Our text is the best possible balance, a balance which is powerful yet delicate, which will enable each delegation, each group of countries, with his head held high, having achieved something important,  French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says. After the pact—the first to legally commit all countries to reducing carbon emissions—was signed, delegates from the 195 countries rose for a standing ovation, the BBC reports. The final agreement represents a compromise between developed and developing countries. Gizmodo reports it calls for nations to keep global warming  well below  2 degrees Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as a target. Countries  already feeling the impacts of climate change  had pushed for the lower limit. Developed countries will commit $100 billion per year to help developing countries, though that commitment isn't legally binding. According to the BBC, nations will have to report on their progress every five years. Gizmodo notes the most optimistic portion of the final agreement is a section calling for net zero carbon emissions sometime in the second half of the 21st century. Wired reports two items not included in the pact are a reduction of air travel and shipping—which account for more than 5% of greenhouse gasses—and reparations for poor countries hurt by climate change.",195 Countries Sign Pact to Fight Global Warming
"(Jan 2, 2019  12:31 PM) Christian Pulisic became the most expensive American soccer player in history after completing a transfer to English club Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Chelsea paid $73 million for the 20-year-old United States winger, who will be loaned back to Dortmund for the rest of this season. The German club won't have to pay Chelsea for the loan. The fee is easily the biggest paid for an American player, surpassing the reported $22.5 million spent by German team Wolfsburg for John Brooks in 2017, reports the AP.  It was always Christian's big dream to play in the Premier League,  Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said.  That certainly has to do with his American origins, and so it wasn't possible for us to extend his contract.",20-Year-Old Is America's Priciest Soccer Player by Far
"(May 18, 2012  8:07 AM CDT) Families of 9/11 victims are dismayed that a financial dispute has indefinitely delayed completion of the museum at Ground Zero. The museum, a companion to the 9/11 memorial, was supposed to be finished by this year's 11th anniversary, but officials now say that's not possible. The holdup stems from a financial battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation that controls the memorial and museum, reports the AP. The Port Authority says the foundation owes it $300 million for infrastructure and updated project costs; the foundation counters that the port owes it money because of project delays. Personal items that families have donated to the museum are stuck in storage while the dispute, which has slowed down work since late last year, drags on.  We were supposed to get a contemplative area nearby where we could sit and pray, visit,  says one woman whose sister worked on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's south tower. No trace of her sister was ever identified, and she wants the museum to open so she can visit the thousands of fragments of human remains that could not be identified. Officials say progress has been made toward resolving the dispute, but family members say they have not been kept apprised of the progress.",New Thorn for 9/11 Families: Ground Zero Museum Delay
"(Jan 19, 2019  5:00 PM) Advocates for gender equality are reckoning with what one called a  wonderful challenge —four or more women running for president in 2020, the AP reports. To many activists, that means a field more reflective of a party that counts women as a crucial voting bloc. But the prospect of multiple women in the race also presents obstacles, with no single candidate holding a claim to women's votes to the degree Hillary Clinton did in 2016. The women's vote, and groups that provide financial and grassroots support, could split. Looming over it all is persistent gender bias and the question of whether Americans are ready to elect a female president.

Six months pregnant in October of 2013, she was cleared by her doctor to vacation in Hawaii with her husband, and she made sure to get Blue Cross insurance coverage before her trip. Just two days in, though, her water broke and she was put on bed rest for six weeks with stern warnings about flying, even with a surgical team, reports CBC. She ended up having baby Reece nine weeks early, and her two-month hospital stay led to a $950,000 medical bill—and a letter from Blue Cross denying any coverage due to a pre-existing condition. In its letter, the company wrote:  Ms. Huculak was diagnosed and treated for a high-risk pregnancy in the six months prior to departure. ... Any expenses incurred are not eligible under the terms of your policy.  Huculak-Kimmel says the so-called pre-existing condition was a bladder infection that caused bleeding four months into her pregnancy, and which her own specialist says did not contribute to early labor.  It could happen to anybody. ... They don't know what caused my water to break. These things just happen,  she tells the Toronto Sun. Still, her coverage has been denied, leaving Huculak-Kimmel wondering whether to wait to see what happens, fight Blue Cross, or file for bankruptcy.  It's a very sad situation to be in and people need to be aware that insurance companies will deny you if they have anything they can go on,  she tells CTV News. Since the story first ran, she says she's been overwhelmed by the supportive response but that at this time she isn't taking private donations.

Research scientist Tommy Thompson isn't incarcerated at a a federal prison in Milan, Michigan, for breaking the law. Instead, he's being held in contempt of court for an unusually long stretch—well past the general 18-month internment limit in cases of witnesses refusing to cooperate, the AP reports (an appeals court in 2019 ruled that law didn't apply to him). But nothing is usual about Thompson's case, which dates to his discovery of the SS Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard.

Though that's a smaller figure than in the previous two years, it's up 86% from 2007—and the US is trying to root out the problem. Many applicants are applying for cash without planning to attend school at all; officials have flagged 126,000 questionable applicants since January, the Wall Street Journal reports. That's some 1% of aid applicants for the 2013-2014 academic year. Some of the fraud can be chalked up to organized crime, says the education department's inspector general: Last year, more than 34,000 in crime rings improperly got student cash. For the department, the biggest red flag is the receipt of aid for at least three schools in the same year. Officials tell schools about their concerns, and the schools seek further records from the applicant.  What we find are very poor students academically that are borrowing to the max, getting the maximum in their Pell grant and just going from school to school,  says a financial aid director at Maryland's Anne Arundel Community College.

The USS Gabrielle Giffords, constructed by Austal USA in Mobile, Ala., has completed testing in the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to be commissioned in mid-2017, the AP reports. The company handed over the $475 million ship to the Navy on Friday. Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot during a 2011 assassination attempt, helped christen the ship in 2015. The 421-foot-long Giffords will be the ninth in a series of high-speed vessels designed to navigate in shallow coastal regions known as littoral waters. It's part of a hotly debated program that congressional critics slam as flawed and too expensive but that Navy leaders defend as a critical new step in naval warfighting. Arizona Sen. John McCain has cited the $12.4 billion spent for 26 littoral combat ships as the worst example of wasteful Pentagon spending. The ship's name also has become a target for conservatives who see it as promoting stricter gun laws, a cause Giffords has promoted. The Navy said it chose to name the ship in honor of Giffords because of the perseverance she showed after the shooting.  Courage comes in many, many forms—physical, mental, spiritual, and political.

Flemmi said Salemme watched as his son Francis Jr.—an assistant manager at DiSarro's nightclub, per the AP—strangled DiSarro, who reportedly borrowed money from the mob to reopen the Channel Nightclub, per the Boston Herald and WCVB.

As Benjamin Morris writes, the chances of the independent candidate claiming the White House  are slim, not none.  And it's all about Utah: A traditional Mormon conservative, McMullin has positioned himself as an alternative to Trump—and that may be a winning strategy in his home state, where Trump has acknowledged a  tremendous problem  rallying support, per the Deseret News. If McMullin snatches Utah's six electoral votes, he could prevent any candidate from collecting the 270 electoral votes required to win. In that situation, the election would be decided in Congress, opening up the chance for McMullin. With many House Republicans turning their back on Trump of late, it's possible they'd choose McMullin over the man atop their party's ticket. (Morris lays out in detail the convoluted process in the House and Senate that could conceivably put him over the top.) You'd be forgiven for not recognizing the name—only 52% of Utahans know who McMullin is, based on a recent state poll. (The former CIA officer's bio is here.) Still, McMullin was polling at 22% in the state—ahead of Gary Johnson and trailing the deadlocked Clinton and Trump by just four percentage points.

"(Aug 15, 2011  12:25 PM CDT) A crew of cosmonauts has broken the record for longest space mission, having spent 438 days in a 12-foot-wide capsule. But they'll also break another record when their mission is up—the record for shortest distance traveled on a space mission—because they've never actually left Moscow in all that time. The Mars500 crew has 82 days left of a 520-day simulated mission to Mars, meant to test the psychological and physical impact of a long-distance space flight. The record for actual time in space is 437 days, set in 2005 by Valeri Polyakov, the Daily Mail reports. The crew has been in isolation in a Moscow parking lot in a windowless capsule measuring 550 cubic meters, constantly monitored by behavioral specialists. Three of the astronauts left halfway through the mission to simulate the two days spent researching Mars, then re-boarded, but no one has abandoned the mission though they are all free to. They have had limited contact with friends and family via emails and video messages; they eat canned food and  shower  in a sauna-like room just once a week; and they sleep in tiny pods with cot-like beds in living quarters around the size of a bus.

Their mother is in critical condition, and two other people are hospitalized, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. The two carjackers remain at large, and the mayor's office and police are offering a $110,000 reward, reports USA Today. Details are still filling in, but police offer this chain of events: Two men carjacked a real estate agent and forced her into the backseat of her SUV. After about a mile, the SUV apparently blew a tire at a high rate of speed, crashed into the fruit stand, and eventually hit a tree, reports NBC Philadelphia. The carjackers fled on foot, and the real estate agent is among the injured. A 10-year-old boy died at the scene, while his 15-year-old sister and 7-year-old brother died at local hospitals.

"(Mar 5, 2015  8:09 AM) Was it bad service, bad timing, or blatant racism? Either way, Kathleen Hampton, a self-described small-business owner, is suing Enzo's Caffe Italiano in Portland, Ore., for $100,000 for the way she was treated on Valentine's Day, reports the Oregonian. Having made reservations for two, but arriving alone when her husband said he was still full from lunch and didn't feel like dining out, Hampton says she was forced to wait for a table for two while other diners who came in after she did were seated. After  not getting any services  once seated, she asked to order but says she was told she had to give up her table and leave the establishment. She asked for takeout, she says, but was told the restaurant didn't offer it.  That was the final straw,  Hampton says in the lawsuit.  I've never heard of a food place not having to-go.   I cried, I've never been so embarrassed and humiliated in my life,  she tells KOIN 6 News.  I didn't fit their decor in there. I was the only African-American.  Enzo Lanzadoro, the restaurant's owner, vehemently denied these claims, saying he is Italian and both employs and serves customers of any race. He also says Hampton was offered a seat at the bar where single diners had been seated (Hampton denies this), that she left without paying after drinking two glasses of wine, and that she is welcome to come by the restaurant anytime to work things out because he would never turn away a customer.  Why would we do that? Any sensible person would not do that,  he says. (Check out why this restaurant is banning tips altogether.)",Portland Woman Wants $100K for Bad V-Day Service

The Macon Telegraph reports that Monroe County Sheriff John Cary Bittick gave officers 54 $100 bills to hand out randomly over three days during the past week.  Today, we'd like to spread a little joy in the community, so we'd like to give you this,  a deputy said to a motorist he'd pulled over. The driver, James King, seemed relieved:  Oh, thank you.

"(Jul 16, 2010  9:29 AM CDT) The first half of 2010 was the hottest on record, according to federal data released yesterday. From January to June, the average global temperature was 57.5 degrees F, which is 1.22 degrees above the 20th-century average and higher than 1998’s first-half record. We’ve also already had the most record-temperature months ever seen in the same calendar year, again surpassing 1998, MSNBC reports. The records date back to 1880.  Each of the 10 warmest average global temperatures recorded since 1880 have occurred in the last fifteen years,  the National Climatic Data Center noted in its report. At this rate, 2010 could easily break 2005’s record for warmest full year. The center also noted that the area covered by Arctic sea ice was 10.6% below the 1979-2000 average in June, though Anatarctic sea ice was actually a record 8.3% above average.","So Far, 2010 Is Warmest Year Ever"

A spokesman wouldn't confirm the decision to retire:  After many thoughtful conversations with family and friends over the last several months, Senator Lieberman made a decision about his future over the holidays which he plans to announce on Wednesday.  But everyone from the Huffington Post to the New York Times to the Washington Post are quoting Democratic sources as saying that Lieberman will not seek a fifth term.

"(Mar 5, 2013  7:26 AM) Last week, Arkansas' governor vetoed a ban on abortions after the 20-week mark; the state legislature overrode the veto. Now, Gov. Mike Beebe has vetoed a bill that would ban abortions after just 12 weeks—and once again, lawmakers will today try to override the Democrat's veto; success would make it the toughest abortion ban in the US. All that's needed is a simple majority in both chambers of the legislature, where Republicans hold 21 of 35 Senate seats and 51 of 100 House seats, the AP notes.  Because it would impose a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic abortion well before viability, Senate Bill 134 blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court,  Beebe said of the 12-week measure. Roe v. Wade says abortion is legal until a baby can survive outside its mother, which doctors say typically occurs 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The American Civil Liberties Union says the 12-week ban is  the most extreme abortion ban in the country,  and it plans to sue if the measure passes.","After Veto, Arkansas Tries to Save 12-Week Abortion Ban"

But now the shop's manager says the honesty-box tradition may need to end and the store will be locked at night after it was burglarized over the weekend—what many believe to be the first theft in nearly half a century. Stolen were candy, chocolate bars, coffee, batteries, toiletries, and tea-time biscuits, per the store's Facebook page, as well as six hand-knit wool caps made by manager Julie McCabe.  We are all pretty gutted,  she tells the Aberdeen Press and Journal.  I am absolutely floored that someone has been in and did that to our community.  And what the Mirror is calling the island's  crime wave  doesn't stop there: Someone also ripped off the island's beauty shop, apparently on the same night, lifting body butter, bath oils, and shower gels, and money from that store's honesty box. The island, which boasts a population of less than 30, by various counts, prides itself on its nonexistent crime rate and doesn't even have a police station, the Guardian notes.

The CDC said on Friday that 212 cases have emerged in 23 states, with 8 new states listed since Tuesday. While bacterial outbreaks are often linked to a food source, officials haven't yet identified a food, restaurant, or grocery store in this case. Health officials are now talking to those who fell ill in an attempt to trace the sickness. States reporting salmonella cases include California, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming, CBS 47 reports. A CDC map shows Utah and Oregon are the hardest hit. The CDC tells us that salmonella infections usually come with diarrhea, stomach cramps, and fever, and last between a few hours and six days after exposure to the bacteria. Children under 5, adults 65 and up, and people with weaker immune systems are more prone to developing severe illness. Officials say the best way to avoid infection is to stay clean (washing hands and surfaces), keep food that needs cooking away from food that doesn't, cook at a temperature that kills germs, and put perishable foods in the fridge within an hour or two. Meanwhile, CNN reports that a Cyclospora outbreak linked to salad mixes has now sickened 641 people in 11 states.",Mystery Salmonella Outbreak Hits 23 States

The $15 million will cover the US' share of the convention's operating budget. The executive secretary of the Framework Convention on Climate Change calls the money  crucial.

Forty-one years later, Chun Wook-pyo, 68, has made it back home, South Korea today confirmed. He's  the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped,  says a rep for the Seoul-based Abductees' Family Union, per the Daily Mail. And he's one of thousands of fishermen believed to have been taken by the North across decades, though Pyongyang denies it. Some 450 have never returned home, reports the New York Times. The escape, first reported last month, is rare; the Times reports that eight fisherman are previously said to have made it back since 2000. And the ordeal doesn't necessarily end upon reaching home: According to the Mail, South Korean officials are typically suspicious of escapees like Chun, fearing they could have been indoctrinated by the North and set free as a spy. They may also be concerned that the person claiming to be Chun could in fact be a North Korean agent. Chun was reportedly questioned for two weeks upon his arrival in the South before rejoining his family.

The BBC reports that all 21 members on the board of the Association for the Promotion of Cinema, which oversees the Cesar Academy that hands out the awards, have  unanimously decided to resign,  per a board statement,  to find calm and ensure that the festival of film remains just that, a festival.  What had threatened to disrupt that calm: the 12 nominations that director Roman Polanski had received for J'Accuse (An Officer and a Spy). Polanski fled the United States in early 1978 after being convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl. The 86-year-old, who has both French and Polish citizenship, has been living in France, which doesn't extradite its own citizens. Per Variety, the Cesar Academy has been under the microscope of late, with hubbub not only directed at the Polanski film but at the organization's lack of diversity and gender parity. While Al Jazeera reports on the pushback the Polanski film and its nominations have been receiving from feminist groups, the Cesar Academy has noted that it shouldn't be taking  moral positions  on films or filmmakers when considering the merits of a particular movie.

That's when Gantt says divine intervention kicked in. With a harness and rope, Catchings managed to push the car door open despite the rushing water.  It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,  he says, per NBC News. Right in front of Gantt's car was a giant red cross, and that's what the two clung to for the frightening five hours until rescuers came. Catchings even called his wife from their perch, thinking it was the last time he'd speak to her.  It was the hardest phone call I've ever made,  he tells WIS.  I just told her that I loved her.  Gantt, who suffered a broken ankle and hypothermia, doesn't think the cross was an accident.  Jesus is my savior,  she says.  This story is not about me, it's about what he did to save me.

"(May 22, 2013  2:10 PM CDT) David Gonzalez bought an abandoned home in Elbow Lake, Minnesota, for about $10,000, planning to remodel it. But he ended up getting more than he bargained for—more than 10 times more, it seems. In the walls of the house, amid the newspapers used as insulation, Gonzalez found a copy of the Holy Grail of comic books: 1938's Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman. He's auctioning it off, and the current bid is more than $113,000; the auction ends on June 11, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. Pristine copies of Action Comics #1 have sold for more than $2 million, but this copy was already in fairly poor condition, considering it had been used as insulation for decades. Then, when Gonzalez invited his in-laws to look at his find, his wife's aunt grabbed the comic; Gonzalez grabbed it back, and the back cover tore.  That was a $75,000 tear,  says the co-owner of the auction house selling the book. Even so, collectors have been wowed by the book, considering it's never been traded or resold and is  like a virgin comic,  says another co-owner. And Gonzalez isn't upset about the tear:  Money won't buy you happiness,  he says. What it will buy him:  I always wanted a 1992 Camaro IROC Z28,  he tells the New York Daily News.  I think I have enough money to buy my Camaro now.  He also plans to pay off his house and truck, and his wife will finish school.",Guy Finds $113K Comic in Wall of Old House

The bodies of 11 women and a fetus were discovered by a hiker in the desert near Albuquerque last year, and police say 57-year-old Ron Erwin, who owns a health food store and photo business, is just one person of many being probed in connection with the killings, the Joplin Globe reports. Investigators say nearly all of the women are prostitutes who disappeared between 2003 and 2005.

Nadal thrust his arms into the air and pumped his fist after a long ball by Nalbandian made him the champion of the indoor clay-court tournament for the second time. The Spaniard also won the event in 2005. It was Nadal's 51st singles title, and first since winning the French Open for the seventh time last June. Nadal struggled to find a rhythm in the beginning but was still able to break Nalbandian's serve twice to take the first set.

Now in an interview with NBC News, Dr. Harold Bornstein admits he wrote the four-paragraph letter in just five minutes while Trump's limo waited for him to finish. Bornstein says he didn't even stop to proofread it. That could explain multiple errors in the letter, including opening with  To Whom My Concerns,  Politico reports. Regardless, Bornstein stands by his diagnosis.  His health is excellent, especially his mental health,  he tells NBC (though Politico points out Bornstein is a gastroenterologist with no apparent psychiatry or psychology license). Bornstein's letter raised eyebrows in December for describing Trump's lab results as  astonishingly excellent  and stating his  physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.  Bornstein tells NBC he thinks Trump's way of speaking rubbed off on him when he wrote the letter.  Clearly, Trump's hyperbole is itself a disease—and it's contagious,  the Washington Post quips. Asked about his claim that Trump would be the healthiest person elected president, Bornstein points out that all the other presidents  are either sick or dead.

Overall, the average temperature was 55.3 degrees F, or 3.2 degrees F above the 20th-century average. If that wasn't enough, it also the second-most extreme year on record, based on the US Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account factors like tropical storms, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The index came in at almost twice its average level, which makes sense given that 2012 saw 11 disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damage. Precipitation was significantly below average, as you might expect given the massive drought that hit much of the country this summer.

"(Sep 15, 2017  6:06 PM CDT) Everyone dies, and frequently it's what we eat (or don't eat) that's killing us. The Guardian reports the newest results from the massive, ongoing Global Burden of Disease study show diet is a factor in one of every five deaths around the world. That means millions of people are consuming too much salt and sugar and not enough whole grains, fruits, seeds, nuts, and fish oils.  It is amongst the really big problems in the world,  says Dr. Christopher Murray, the head of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. But malnutrition can be an even bigger problem than eating too many burgers, Fortune reports. And in many cases unhealthy diets have their root in economics.  Take fruit,  Murray tells the Guardian.  It has lots of health benefits, but only very wealthy people eat a lot of fruit, with some exceptions.  In addition to diet, other leading risk factors in worldwide deaths are smoking and high blood pressure. But it's not all bad news.

He was 93. Known as a policymaker with a fixation for statistical analysis, McNamara was the CEO of Ford when he was recruited by Kennedy in 1961. After he left the Pentagon, 7 years later, McNamara served as the World Bank president for 12 years. In his 1995 memoir, McNamara disclosed that by 1967 he had deep misgivings about Vietnam—by then he had lost faith in America's capacity to prevail over a guerrilla insurgency—but he continued to express optimism publicly.",Vietnam Architect Robert McNamara Dead at 93

The DEA and forest authorities have dug up more than 578,000 cannabis plants in the western US since July 1, as part of a two-month operation that saw 14 people arrested in California. Plants were found in the forests and national parks of that state, along with those in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, reports the AFP. The plants are estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. More than 80% of the plants were pulled from California soil—and that's not all that was uprooted.  Huge amounts of trash, miles of irrigation line, and many pounds of fertilizer and pesticides were removed from grow sites on public lands,  the Justice Department said in a statement, lamenting the long-term environmental consequences of such operations.  Marijuana growers remove natural vegetation. They cut down trees to allow sunlight into the site, and they divert streams from their natural path to irrigate the land.

In a lengthy Instagram post, Kate Beckinsale recounts an experience she had with Weinstein at the Savoy Hotel (the age of consent in the UK is 16).  He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,  she writes.  After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.  Years later,  he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.  She also says a male friend was ostracized by Weinstein after warning another young actress about him; that woman ended up sleeping with Weinstein. Beckinsale's account comes as cops in both the US and the UK confirm they're investigating allegations against Weinstein, the Guardian reports. London police are looking into a sexual abuse allegation made against him and received by the department Wednesday. The NYPD, meanwhile, says it's  conducting a review to determine if there are any additional complaints relating to the Harvey Weinstein matter  based on allegations in news reports.  No filed complaints have been identified as of this time,  the NYPD statement notes. Actresses in the US and abroad have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault.

Matthew Hay-Chapman recognized the inmates' stolen van in a Whole Foods parking lot on Jan. 28 and spotted fugitive Hossein Nayeri emerging from the vehicle. He says he found a police officer and led him to the van, leading to the capture of Nayeri and fellow escapee Jonathan Tieu. A third man had surrendered a day earlier. Hay-Chapman, 55, was living in Golden Gate Park at the time of the arrests but says he still kept track of the news every day by going online or reading newspapers, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The Orange County Board of Supervisors decided to award him $100,000 of the $150,000 cash reward for the inmates' recapture, with $20,000 going to the owner of the stolen van, and two employees who spotted the escapees acting suspiciously at a Target store receiving $15,000 each.

Though the conversations were recorded by US intelligence in early 2015, months before Trump announced his campaign for the presidency, investigators are interested in mentions of meetings between Russian officials and Trump associates, some of which reportedly occurred outside of the US, the Wall Street Journal reports. It isn't clear if the associates referred to were involved in Trump's business interests in Russia or later became part of his presidential campaign. Officials say it's commonplace for Russian officials to discuss players with major business interests in the country, Trump among them. Indeed, intelligence agencies initially took little from the conversations. But Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton has since renewed interest. President Trump said Wednesday he only became aware of the meeting with the lawyer  a couple of days ago,  per Reuters.

A victims' compensation fund is to be distributed among  women who experienced a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination while working at the Weinstein Company, as well as sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein,  the New York Attorney General's office said Tuesday, per CNN. The initial lawsuit naming TWC, Weinstein, and his brother, Robert, described  one group of female employees whose primary job it was to accompany HW to events and to facilitate HW's sexual conquests.  One employee was reportedly flown from London to New York  to teach HW’s assistants how to dress and smell more attractive to HW.

But that's not how some of Weinstein's alleged victims see it.

It's a  fantastic achievement,  the project lead tells Live Science, which was the culmination of three years of meticulous planning, including building a platform and a crane and suctioning debris from the ship's frame.  The shipwreck can become a symbol of our rich maritime history, and I fully expect many people, both young and old, to be amazed by and start enjoying this ship,  he says. The 65-foot, 55-ton ship was discovered in 2012 during efforts to widen the flow of the Ijssel River. It is a ship known as a cog, which were used for international trade voyages in the late medieval period, per Live Science. While the vessel was stripped down before it was sunk, researchers did find a brick oven and glazed tiles in its galley. A barge and punt (a small boat) of the same period also were found on the riverbed. Researchers believe the watercraft were sunk purposely to divert the flow of the river and improve sea traffic. Now, the ship will be transported to a preservation facility in Leylstad, where it may take as long as three years to dry out. The hope is to eventually put the ship in a museum. But there is a possibility that the drying process won't work, in which case, Live Science notes, it will be studied then destroyed.

According to KABC, Lee Baca, who served as sheriff for 15 years, was found guilty of obstructing justice for his role in a scheme to hamper an FBI investigation into alleged abuses at Los Angeles County jails. Guards were accused of beating inmates, and during an FBI investigation in 2011, deputies under Baca moved the FBI's prison informant to keep him from agents, told the informant and other deputies not to cooperate with the FBI, and threatened to arrest the lead FBI agent in an effort to intimidate her, the Los Angeles Times reports. The three-year sentence for Baca, who's 74 years old and suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's, is one more than prosecutors requested and a far cry from an attempted plea deal of fewer than six months. Judge Percy Anderson was critical of Baca for not taking responsibility for his role in the obstruction plot, saying he would have sentenced Baca to five years in prison if not for his Alzheimer's.  Your actions embarrass the thousands of men and women who put their lives on the line every day,  Anderson told Baca during sentencing.

As a 10-year-old Chicago boy he stumbled upon three boxes in his home's crawl space that told quite a story: His mother Dora had on April 26, 1964, given birth to a son named Paul. Someone dressed as a nurse retrieved the newborn at some point the next day and then vanished. Vibeke Venema writes for the BBC that the  biggest manhunt in Chicago's history  ensued, with 175,000 postal workers participating. The baby—who hadn't been footprinted or fingerprinted—wasn't found. All that remained was a photo showing the shape of the boy's ear, an ear that seemed to match that of a child abandoned in Newark, NJ, in July of the following year. The FBI told Dora and Chester Fronczak their child had been found. But doubt lingered, at least on Paul's part.  I was found so far away, it just seemed so unfathomable.

In 1976, women worked 26 hours a week in the home while men worked just six hours. A stay-at-home dad said he wasn’t surprised.

"(Mar 8, 2020  12:28 PM CDT) Chad Ellingwood's life is pretty much hell, and Wall Street is stoking the flames. That's according to a New York Times Magazine article chronicling his fall from happy homeowner in LA County's San Fernando Valley to miserable, embattled tenant in the same property, now owned by a company that raises the rent, slaps him with fees, and tries to evict him whenever he falls behind. Granted, Ellingwood opened the door by beginning a bankruptcy filing in 2012. But even though he never finished it, a lien was placed on the property, allowing a company called Strategic Acquisitions to buy his home. Turns out there are dozens of similar companies that bought foreclosed properties around America after the 2007 housing crisis, turning them into profit-makers now worth $60 billion. In fact, Wall Street investors bought 95% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's distressed properties without any real conditions, creating a single-family rental market that they funded with new kinds of bonds and shares—which the companies can only afford to reimburse by charging tenants stiff fees and higher rents. A top company says it fixes up homes and has a 96% occupancy rate, but there's a Facebook group of irate tenants struggling to fight back. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported last year that Blackstone, a major firm that invested in all this, walked away with $7 billion. Which leaves Ellingwood where?

Claiming that New York's water supply, which originates Upstate, is laden with pesticides, herbicides, prescription drugs, and the aforementioned cowpies, the owners of Molecule run the water through a $25,000 seven-stage filtering gizmo—then sell it to you for $2.50 a bottle.  I mean it's subtle, but if you have a sensitive palate you can totally tell,  says a co-owner. That predictably has upset public health officials, who have long prided themselves on the Big Apple's water quality; one DEP spokesman calls it the  safest, highest quality (water) in the world, a standard we confirm through more than 500,000 tests each year.  One expert says dropping $15 on an in-home filtration system would get the job done; NYC's  water quality is not that bad to begin with,  she says. But that's not slowing down Molecule's owners, who  sex it up  a bit by adding electrolytes or pH infusions to their pure H2O.

"(Nov 30, 2017  11:30 AM) It's believed that Australia has only twice opened a third coroner's inquest into someone's death: with the infamous case of Azaria Chamberlain, the baby taken by a dingo, and with the 1988 death of a 27-year-old American mathematician. On Thursday, a coroner gave the ruling his brother had been seeking for years: that Scott Johnson's death at the bottom of a Sydney cliff was not an act of suicide but a hate crime. The New York Times quotes the state coroner, Magistrate Michael Barnes, as saying he was  persuaded to the requisite standard Scott Johnson died as a result of a gay hate attack ; he added there was insufficient evidence to establish who killed Johnson, however. Steve Johnson in 2005 learned  there were three other cases of gay men that died at cliff sides that had probably been attacked by marauding teen gangs [and] collapsed  at the news, he said late last year. His lobbying helped secure a second inquest, which in 2012 overturned the suicide ruling. The Guardian reports that Barnes found Johnson's behavior was free of characteristics often linked with suicide, like mental health or drug issues, and that  naked suicide —his clothes were left folded atop the North Head cliffs—is  exceptionally rare.  Barnes referenced the  inadequacy  of the original investigation, in which investigators  quickly jumped to conclusions  and failed to identify the location where Johnson fell as a known  gay beat,  where gay men would meet up. Australia's ABC reports Barnes found many reports of teens and young men assaulting gay men in the area. For Steve Johnson, the case hasn't been put to bed.  The inquest produced many leads toward possible perpetrators,  he said, per the Guardian.  Now it's time for a homicide investigation.","They Said His 1988 Death Was Suicide.

The unrest at industrial parks established to attract foreign investors, which followed protests involving up to 20,000 workers, was the most serious outbreak of public disorder in the tightly controlled country in years, and comes as the government tries to manage public anger against China while itself protesting Chinese actions in a part of the South China Sea it claims as its own. An official says the protests were initially peaceful but were hijacked by  extremists  who incited people to break into the factories. He said at least 15 factories were set alight and  hundreds  more vandalized or looted, while some security guards and unidentified  foreign experts  were assaulted.

"(Aug 30, 2014  8:59 AM CDT) Nicaraguan rescuers have saved 22 of at least 26 workers trapped in a mine collapse and were working to find the rest. First lady Rosario Murillo said 20 of the miners were freed late yesterday, in addition to two who made their way to safety shortly after the Thursday morning collapse cut off the exit at the El Comal gold and silver mine in the town of Bonanza. The miners were dehydrated but in otherwise good health. Rescued miner Marvin Urbina, 34, said he and some of his fellow miners saw an avalanche of mud and rock coming their way. They stuck to the walls of the mine, but he thinks at least four of their co-workers were crushed. The gold and silver mine is on a concession held by Hemco, which is owned by Colombia-based Minero SA. But the trapped miners themselves are freelancers allowed to work in the area if they sell any gold they find to the firm, says a company spokesman. He says the company had warned miners about the danger of working in the El Comal area, especially after two miners died in a rain-caused landslide there last month. Hundreds of relatives and fellow miners had gathered to pray outside the mine as rescuers lined up several ladders along a 200-foot long tunnel leading toward where the men were trapped.",Nicaragua Frees 22 Trapped Miners

When the 33-year-old son went up to set about renovating the large, unused space last week, he happened upon the remains of a woman who's been missing for nearly 40 years, covered in leaves and straw and wearing pants, shoes, and multiple jackets, reports the Independent.

Authorities have linked the remains to a 28-year-old woman with three children and a history of mental illness.

"(Jul 20, 2020  8:49 AM CDT) Congress returns to session on Monday, and one issue will be dominating the headlines on that front in the coming days: a second round of aid for COVID-19. As NPR notes, supplemental unemployment benefits of $600 per week that Congress approved four months ago for tens of millions of Americans are about to expire, and lawmakers will have to decide whether to extend them. Another big decision: whether Americans will receive a second stimulus check. Much is up in the air on that, including how much it would be and who would qualify this time around, reports CNET. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said lawmakers will be  looking at another direct payment,  though he said the focus should be on those making less than $40,000, per MassLive. Also on the line: whether to extend federal eviction protections, set to expire at the end of July, reports Politico.

It's like a miracle except that it's all because of the doctors,  says the 34-year-old Brit from Barcelona, who suffered the longest cardiac arrest ever recorded in Spain. She was hiking with her husband in the Pyrenees mountains when they were caught in a snowstorm on Nov. 3, reports Reuters. Rohan Schoeman watched as his wife's speech and movement became impeded as a result of severe hypothermia. Then she fell unconscious.  I couldn't feel a breath, I couldn't feel a heartbeat,  he recalls, per the BBC, explaining why he thought his wife was dead. Doctors aren't surprised. By the time Schoeman arrived at Barcelona's Vall d'Hebron Hospital, her body temperature was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and she had no vital signs.  If she had been in cardiac arrest for this long at a normal body temperature, she would be dead,  says doctor Eduard Argudo, per the BBC.  But we knew that, in the context of hypothermia, Audrey had a chance of surviving.  The low body temperature had preserved her body and brain, says Argudo. That allowed doctors to remove blood and infuse it with oxygen before putting it back in her body. And as Schoeman's temperature climbed into the 80s, doctors used a defibrillator to get her heart ticking again. The result: Schoeman was released 12 days later with only mobility issues in her hands, per Reuters. For Argudo, it's remarkable, if not a miracle.

"(Sep 26, 2012  10:34 AM CDT) Upon hearing rumors that his daughter had married her girlfriend in France, Cecil Chao Sze-tsung did what any loving dad would do: He offered nearly $64.5 million to the guy who can romance Gigi Chao into a traditional marriage instead, calling reports of her lesbian marriage  false.  The Hong Kong billionaire property magnate says he doesn't care how wealthy Gigi's suitor is, he just wants someone  generous and kind-hearted —and, you know, male. Gigi, 33, works with her father and the Telegraph reports that she has previously noted his  hands-off approach  to parenting, which seems pretty ironic in retrospect. In attempting to sell any potential suitors on her, Chao told the South China Morning Post,  Gigi is a very good woman with both talents and looks. She is devoted to her parents, is generous and does volunteer work.  He said he'd love to help her future husband start a business, and hinted that perhaps men who have  the talent but not the capital  may be interested in his deal.",Billionaire: I'll Give You $64M to Wed My Gay Daughter
"(May 21, 2017  4:30 PM CDT) The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus that has wowed crowds for 146 years with its  Greatest Show on Earth  is taking its final bow on Sunday. The circus' last show at the Nassau County Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, is sold out, and former circus performers will be in the audience. Ringling's parent company, Feld Entertainment, announced in January it would close the show, citing declining attendance and high operating costs. Animal rights activists had targeted the circus, saying that forcing animals to perform and transporting them around the country amounted to abuse. And in May 2016, the company removed elephants from its shows, but ticket sales continued to decline, reports the AP. Once a mainstay of entertainment in small towns and big cities alike, Ringling had two touring circuses this season, one of which ended its run earlier this month in Providence, Rhode Island. That show was the more traditional, three-ring circus, while the one in Uniondale this weekend has a narrative storyline. Called  Out of This World,  it's set in futuristic outer space, with Ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson narrating in his signature baritone. There are mild explosions and flashing lights—a sensory overload, but one that captivates the little ones. In the end, though, Feld executives said they knew the circus couldn't compete with iPhones, the internet, video games, and massively branded and carefully marketed characters. Their other productions—Frozen on Ice, Marvel Live, Monster Trucks, Disney on Ice—resonate better with younger generations.","After 146 Years, Ringling Bros. Shuts Down Circus"
"(Jan 31, 2017  3:42 PM) Almost half of all natural world heritage sites are slowly being degraded, and experts have a clear suspect: humans. A study based on the Human Footprint Index—which evaluates agriculture, infrastructure, population density, and other factors—identifies more than 100 of 229 sites that are suffering from human activities, reports Smithsonian.  The world would never accept the Acropolis being knocked down, nor a couple of pyramids being flattened for housing estates or roads, yet, right now, across our planet, we are letting many of our natural world heritage sites be fundamentally altered,  the study author says in a release. The Guardian notes that many sites suffering damage are home to endangered species or those that can’t be found anywhere else. Losses were seen on every continent, but North America alone has accounted for 57% of forest loss globally since 1993, with pine beetles seen as the main problem. Overall, however, sites in Asia fared the worst. Some notable specifics close to home: The Waterton Glacier International Peace Park on the US-Canada border has lost 23% of its forested area, Yellowstone 10%, and the Grand Canyon 6%. This  is alarming and must be addressed,  says lead author James Allan from the University of Queensland. The study authors urge UNESCO to institute conservation measures before the damage becomes irreparable. (Australia wanted to log one of its heritage sites.)",Humans Taking a Toll on 100 World Heritage Sites

With a gain of just 0.4%, Thomas Forester has become a minor celebrity in the financial world, and brokers are suddenly eager to sell his tiny fund to investors. It's a welcome turnaround for Forester, who nearly shuttered the fund last year, reports the Wall Street Journal. Forester trailed the S&P through 2007, and his wife told him he would have to close the fund unless he beat the index by 10 points last March.

A Houston Fire Department spokesperson says the plane crashed shortly after 1pm into a car that was parked at a hardware store near Hobby Airport. Fire Capt. Ruy Lozano says officials believe the three people killed in the accident were on the plane. No one was in the parked car that was hit by the plane, he says.  It didn't strike the building. No fire.

"(Nov 25, 2020  11:28 AM) The parents of Seth Rich have reached a settlement with Fox News, which put forth the conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee staffer killed in what police said was a robbery gone wrong in 2016 was instead murdered after leaking Democratic emails to WikiLeaks. A recent Yahoo investigation found the story had been pushed by Russia, apparently to distract from its own role in leaking the emails. Fox's 2017 story was mentioned widely across the network before it was retracted a week later for failing to meet a  high degree of editorial scrutiny.  Still, the conspiracy theory continued to spread. Joel and Mary Rich of Omaha, Neb., subsequently sued the network for emotional distress, arguing Fox had  intentionally exploited  their son's murder for political reasons, per the Washington Post. On Tuesday, the couple filed a notice to dismiss the suit. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Yahoo's sources say the Rich family will receive a  seven figure payment.  In a statement, the couple says they're  pleased with the settlement,  which  closes another chapter in our efforts to mourn the murder of our beloved Seth, whom we miss every single day,  per CNN. They also express  hope that the media will take genuine caution in the future.  A Fox News rep says the network is similarly pleased and hopes the settlement brings the family  a small degree of peace and solace moving forward.

"(Aug 1, 2019  10:40 AM CDT) A 7-year-old boy in India currently has 21 teeth. He used to have a whole lot more—another 526. The odd case began when the boy sought treatment for pain and swelling in his lower right jaw. An X-ray showed a teeth-filled sac, which one surgeon likened to a  balloon with small pieces inside.  Dr. Prathiba Ramani, the head of oral and maxillofacial pathology at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital in Chennai, tells CNN that following the July surgery, his team spent more than four hours relieving the 7-ounce sac of its contents and examining what was removed. In a press release, the examining pathologists describe it as  reminiscent of pearls in an oyster.   Even the smallest piece had a crown, root, and enamel coat indicating it was a tooth,  says Ramani, who explains the teeth were as small as .004 inches and as large as 0.6 inches. As for the medical terminology behind the oddity, Ramani calls it  compound composite odontoma,  an unusual condition that could have a genetic cause or could be the result of an environmental factor. The release applauds  the surgeons' discretion in removing the lesion in total without exploring it on the operating table (akin to opening a bag of worms),  which  avoided a major mishap and saved the patient from being under general anesthesia for a longer duration.","In Boy's Mouth: 526 Teeth, Like 'Pearls in an Oyster'"

The plan unveiled today by Paul Ryan of Wisconsin also freezes overall spending on domestic programs and repeals most of the spending in President Obama's recently passed economic stimulus bill. Despite the reductions, the plan projects permanent deficits exceeding $500 billion into the future, fueled largely by big tax cuts.

Authorities say Albert Wong, 36, a decorated Army rifleman, crept into the Veterans Home of California-Yountville with a high-powered rifle and held three mental health workers hostage for hours before killing them and himself, the Press Democrat reports.

Daniela Poggiali, 42, was arrested Friday in connection with 11 patient deaths and had already been under suspicion of killing another in April, the New York Post and ANSA report. Police then found a selfie on her phone of Poggiali giving a thumbs-up beside a dead patient in northeast Italy.

Poggiali was originally suspected of killing a 78-year-old woman who had entered the hospital with minor health issues and allegedly died from a potassium overdose—which can trigger cardiac arrest and be hard to trace because it leaves the body soon after death. Now police believe she may have killed up to 38 patients who  needed extra care or had pushy relatives,  reports ANSA.

If you read the description of the menu item, available since October, you certainly wouldn't think so: It packs chicken, pork sausage, rice, beans, and cheese into a tortilla. Except that same sign also said  300 calories.  And so three customers who bought the burrito in Los Angeles this month are suing. As City News Service reports, one of the men behind the proposed class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the menu item on Nov. 3 thinking it was a 300-calorie dish. David Desmond  felt excessively full and realized that the burrito couldn’t have been just 300 calories  after eating it, per the complaint. LV Anderson does the math at Slate, and reports the true total is closer to 1,050 calories. (That's par for the course at Chipotle, according to this 2015 New York Times article.) The suit would cover  all people who bought food at Chipotle for four years leading up to the filing of the complaint,  even though the chorizo filling is a new menu offering.

"(Feb 26, 2017  5:56 AM) A suspect is in custody after 28 people were injured Saturday when a vehicle plowed into a crowd watching the Krewe of Endymion parade in the Mid-City section of New Orleans, reports the AP. Police Chief Michael Harrison said the suspect is being investigated for driving while intoxicated. Harrison said it looks like a case of DWI.  We suspect that that subject was highly intoxicated,  he said. Twenty-one people were hospitalized after the crash with five victims in guarded condition. Seven others declined to be hospitalized, city Emergency Services Director, Dr. Jeff Elder said. The victims range in age from as young as 3 or 4-years-old to adults in their 30s and 40s, said Elder. Among the injured was one New Orleans police officer. Harrison said the officer, who was on duty, was undergoing tests to determine the extent of her injuries. She was in  good spirits,  he said. The accident came during one of the busiest nights of Mardi Gras when thousands of people throng the streets of Mid-City to watch the elaborate floats and clamor to catch beads and trinkets tossed from riders. As police and city officials were assessing the accident scene, people were streaming home as plastic bags that used to hold trinkets and discarded beads littered the ground. The area where the accident occurred was cordoned off with police barricades. One woman at the scene told the New Orleans Advocate that a silver truck whisked by her just feet away as she was walking through the intersection. Carrie Kinsella said,  I felt a rush it was so fast.  Twenty-year-old Kourtney McKinnis told the Advocate that the driver of the truck seemed almost unaware of what he had just done.  He was just kind of out of it,  she said.","Truck Plows Into Crowd at Mardi Gras, Injures 28"

Princess Cruises says a passenger from Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus at a local hospital, where he's in stable condition, after departing the Diamond Princess when it docked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25, per USA Today. Hong Kong says the 80-year-old man visited mainland China for  a few hours  on Jan. 10, a week before he flew into Tokyo, Japan. He developed a cough on Jan. 19 and boarded the cruise ship in Yokohama the next day, per CNN. He departed Jan. 25 but reportedly didn't seek medical attention until Thursday. The cruise line notes  he did not visit the ship's medical center … and the family members traveling with him remain symptom-free.  But CNN notes several other passengers have reported feeling ill. The two-week cruise was cut short when the Diamond Princess returned to Japan on Monday. It's now docked off the coast of Yokohama as medical officials perform health checks on 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members who will be quarantined until Tuesday night at the earliest. Japanese health officials are also attempting to track down passengers who may have disembarked in other cities, per CNN. Before news of the case, cruise lines including Carnival and Royal Caribbean had already begun barring passengers who'd visited China in the last two weeks, in an effort to prevent a virus outbreak, per CBS News.",Coronavirus Diagnosis Traps 3.7K on Cruise Ship
"(Jun 15, 2018  2:07 AM CDT) Waffle House says its CEO has apologized to a woman who was handcuffed along with her boyfriend over a dispute over a $1.50 charge at one of its restaurants. Activist Shaun King says the black couple were handcuffed after they  refused to pay for a $1.50 overcharge on an orange juice that was listed as $1 on the menu,  Eater reports. Body-cam footage released by police in Fort Walton, Fla., shows the couple explaining that the restaurant charged them $2.50 for the orange juice. Officers, without talking to employees, told them they could be arrested for theft.  We haven't been served at all. We haven't been served so how is it theft? We asked her to explain the bill to us; she gave us no food or nothing and called you guys,  the woman says. King says Waffle House employees called police after the man asked to talk to management, Fox reports. In the video, the couple—who had not received their food and insisted they were going to pay—are handcuffed after arguing with officers. They were eventually released without being arrested after saying they would pay their bill and not return to the outlet. Police say they believe proper protocol was followed, though Waffle House says it feels  both sides could have handled this situation better.  The company says employees at the restaurant will receive additional training—and the couple were given a full refund the next day.

"(Apr 25, 2017  1:57 AM CDT) Bay Area Rapid Transit riders were robbed and assaulted by up to 60 teens in an attack that lasted just seconds Saturday night. Police say at least seven people were robbed and two suffered injuries that needed medical attention after the juveniles swarmed a BART train at Oakland's Coliseum Station, with some teens holding the train's doors open while others confronted the passengers inside, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Police say they were on the scene within minutes, but the teens, who'd jumped the fare gates before rushing the train, had already disappeared into the surrounding neighborhood. Police say there have been recent incidents involving juveniles running onto trains and robbing people before fleeing, but nothing on this scale.  I've been there 24 years and this is the first time I’ve heard of anything like this happening,  says Keith Garcia, president of BART's police union. Police patrols at Oakland stations have been stepped up. Since the suspects are juveniles, security camera images of the teens won't be made public, a BART spokeswoman says, but they will be given to police, the local school district, and the Oakland Housing Authority.

But not when there's a rat in it. The Xiabu Xiabu hotpot chain saw its stock dive more than 12% this week, wiping around $190 million off its value, after a diner at one of its restaurants found a dead—and presumably well-cooked—rat in the broth, the Telegraph reports. Video circulated widely on social media in China, to the shock and disgust of viewers, shows the man in the eastern city of Weifang fishing the boiled rodent out of the murky broth with chopsticks. Hotpot restaurants have become extremely popular in China in recent years, though customers have complained about hygiene issues including the recycling of broth with new diners, the New York Times reports. Xiabu Xiabu, which has more than 300 outlets across China, released and then deleted a statement saying it had  ruled out the possibility that an unhygienic environment has caused the rat to appear.  Authorities said the Weifang branch had been ordered to close for  improvements  after inspectors determined that it had committed violations including buying food from unlicensed suppliers.

"(Mar 9, 2015  3:55 PM CDT) An Amtrak train collided with a tractor-trailer that was stuck on the tracks while trying to make a difficult left-hand turn today in Raleigh, North Carolina. At least one of the train's cars toppled and 55 or more people were injured. The tractor-trailer had backed up several times as the truck's driver tried to make the turn, says Leslie Cipriani, who shot a video of the crash with her cellphone while sitting in her car at a stop sign. While the driver was still attempting the maneuver, Cipriani heard the sound of the oncoming train and saw the crossing arms hit the tractor-trailer.  I saw him jump out of the truck when he knew he couldn't beat it. ... I heard the train noise and thought, 'Oh my God, it's going to happen,'  she says. The truck driver jumped out in time and was not injured. A law enforcement officer was blocking the intersection before the collision, possibly trying to help the truck driver make the turn. Asked if it seemed that the officer knew the train was coming, Cipriani replied:  That's what it looked like.  The tractor-trailer, owned by Guy M. Turner Inc. in Greensboro, had a permit to carry an overweight load of 80,000 pounds, says a state Department of Transportation spokesman. It wasn't immediately clear what the tractor-trailer was carrying; the company did not respond to an email asking for comment. Officials differ on the injury toll, which may have been as high as 62. Today's collision was the third serious commuter train crash in less than two months.

Iain Lee, an ex-I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! contestant and now host of The Late Night Alternative on TalkRadio, found himself on Wednesday talking to  Chris,  a man with slurred speech who said he was nearly 60, mired in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and in the street outside of a nightclub, thinking of taking his own life, the Guardian reports.  I ... want to die, Iain,  Chris said to Lee, who at first thought the caller had a condition that was making him hard to understand.

Police are eyeing 19 young people in the thefts of 46 cars from dealerships in and around Winston-Salem starting in March, but the kids, aged 9 to 16, are walking away.  Detectives have sought, and thus far have been denied, secure custody orders from the Forsyth County Department of Juvenile Justice for the involved juveniles,  the police say in a statement. Police didn't explain, but North Carolina public-safety officials have said they're trying to lower the number of young people in detention amid the pandemic and rely on electronic monitoring.

The original lender to Vancouver cut off funding last fall, and the city has been subsisting on high-interest bridge loans. Both the federal and the provincial government had refused to help Vancouver pay for further construction, leaving the city to pay $70,000 a day in interest alone.

"(Feb 8, 2017  1:48 PM) Two Australian parents are blasting President Trump for including the incident that killed their children on his list of 78 terror attacks he contends weren't properly covered by the media, USA Today reports. British tourists Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, and Tom Jackson, 30, were stabbed to death at an Australian hostel in August. Police say Smail Ayad, the French national who killed them, may have been  romantically obsessed  with Ayliffe-Chung. He has no connection to the Islamic State and was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite that, the deaths of Ayliffe-Chung and Jackson were deemed terror-related by Trump. In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accuses the president of using her daughter's death to  further this insane persecution of innocent people  and  lead ignorant people into darkness and hatred.  In his own open letter, Les Jackson says Trump is purposefully lying about his son's death to  suit his agenda.  Ayliffe says that after seeing Trump's list, the police chief in charge of the investigation emailed to let her know there was still  no terror link  in the case, the Guardian reports. Even people whose family members actually were killed in terror attacks aren't thrilled with Trump's list. Alpha Chung, whose father died in such an attack in Australia, tells ABC it's a  painful experience  to have the death of a loved one dragged back into the news to further a political agenda.

He was 70. The Post & Courier frames his death as  an ironic turn worthy of a novelist.  Though Conroy—who had battled diabetes, high blood pressure, and a failing liver—had lately  taken serious steps to improve his health,  he died less than a month after announcing that he had pancreatic cancer. His death came at home, among family and loved ones in Beaufort, South Carolina, reports the AP.

Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its  four-fingered  KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think  KitKat,  and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj ( quick lunch ) has been around for nearly as long as KitKat.

But—at least within the company—deadlines are being pushed back as the company's new design visionary, Jonathan Ive (who recently made the Time 100 list), makes big overhauls to the look of the software, Bloomberg reports. Many of the iOS logos and programs haven't changed aesthetically since the iPhone was released in 2007. Insiders say the new look will be less shiny and glossy, and rely less on  skeuomorphs  (designs made to imitate their real-world counterparts, like the wooden shelves on the Newsstand app, or the radio mic on Voice Memos), in favor of the  flat  look employed by Microsoft on its Windows Phone, 9to5Mac says.

"(Jul 23, 2018  11:55 AM CDT) Those who back the Endangered Species Act won't be happy to read a quote in the New York Times that sums up a story about its fate:  It's probably the best chance that we have had in 25 years to actually make any substantial changes,  says Richard Pombo, a congressman-turned-lobbyist whose clients include mining companies. The gist of the story is that the 45-year-old act is at imminent risk of being seriously watered down. That's due in part to a slew of proposed bills weakening protection for everything from gray wolves to grizzly bears, but, more significantly, to the White House's own proposal to overhaul the ESA, which was unveiled last week. The push is intensifying now because Republicans control not just the White House but both houses of Congress, something that might not be true after the midterms. The proposal from the Interior and Commerce departments to change the ESA is here. It would generally make it harder to add species to the protected list and easier to remove them, and the Washington Post takes note of a key component: For the first time, it would require officials to weigh economic ramifications in wildlife decisions. Specifically, the proposal would remove the phrase  without reference to possible economic or other impacts  from the original. Environmentalists are alarmed, while those in the opposite camp say the ESA has gone too far in restricting the interests of developers, farmers, and the like.  Anyone who tries to do even modest reform is completely demagogued,  complains Kathleen Sgamma of the Western Energy Alliance. Still, support for the ESA among the public is high across the political spectrum, at about 83%, notes Vox.","After 45 Years, Endangered Species Act May Be in Trouble"

Apparently they're not free, at least not at the Hilton Garden Inn Sonoma County Airport, which one guest learned to his dismay. Now Rodney Harmon has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the Hilton chain over the 75-cent charge, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Harmon says he stepped over the paper as he left the room. But a few days later, he noticed a small warning on his key card pouch informing him of the charge, according to the New York Times.  He did not request a newspaper and assumed it had been placed there by hotel staff,  reads Harmon's suit, which adds that the hotel allegedly tried to hide the charge by listing it in an  extremely small font which is difficult to notice or read  on the key sleeve. Further, the suit accuses the hotel of an  offensive waste of precious resources and energy,  since newspaper readership is down and most of the papers left for guests probably don't get read. Though the 75 cents is  a piddly sum,  writes Ben Popken at the Consumerist,  the case could have big implications if it becomes the impetus to sue other hotel chains, since many hotels do just the same thing.",Hotel Guest Sues Over 75-Cent USA Today

"(Feb 3, 2015  5:00 AM) A San Diego man charged with running a so-called revenge-porn website where people posted nude pictures of their ex-lovers—and then charging the victims to take down the images—has been convicted of 27 felony charges. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was found guilty yesterday of identity theft and extortion and faces up to 20 years in prison. The jury was unable to reach verdicts on two charges of identity theft and conspiracy, and a judge declared a mistrial on the counts. It was believed to be the first conviction of a revenge-porn website operator, although two months ago a Los Angeles man who posted a topless photo of his ex-girlfriend on Facebook was sentenced to a year in jail for violating California's new revenge-porn law. Prosecutors said that in 2012 and 2013, Bollaert allowed people to anonymously post more than 10,000 images, mainly of women, on his now-defunct ugotposted.com site without the knowledge of those in the pictures. The victims' names, cities where they lived, and other information such as links to their Facebook profiles also were posted, authorities alleged. In what prosecutors described as essentially a blackmail scheme, Bollaert ran another now-defunct website, changemyreputation.com, where victims could go and be charged up to $350 to have the images removed. Prosecutors said he earned tens of thousands of dollars from the scheme, which some victims testified had ruined their lives.",Revenge-Porn Site Founder Guilty on 27 Counts

There are nearly three dozen Massachusetts communities said to be at critical risk for EEE, with another 40 at high risk. An average of seven human cases are reported to get the virus annually; so far in 2019, three people in Michigan and one person in Rhode Island have also died from EEE.

"(Feb 24, 2016  6:55 PM) A young woman who accused five teenage boys of chasing away her father and gang-raping her on a playground has recanted her story and prosecutors are dropping criminal charges, the AP reports. The boys had been charged with rape and other crimes following the Jan. 7 encounter in a quiet Brooklyn park. Prosecutors will ask a judge next week to formally dismiss the charges against the boys, who range in age from 14 to 17, a spokesperson for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said. Authorities have no plans to charge the 18-year-old woman. According to investigators, two of the boys said they found the woman having some type of sexual contact with a man, later identified as her father. The woman told police her father was threatened with a gun and driven off by the boys. He flagged down a police car for help, but the woman told police that before officers arrived she was raped by the boys. In a statement, Thompson said the woman provided  multiple inconsistent accounts  of the encounter.  That night, this young woman's father and the five young men engaged in conduct that was reprehensible and wrong, but because of the lack of reliable evidence, criminal charges simply cannot be sustained,  Thompson said. The boys have said the encounter was consensual. Thompson said the woman didn't want to pursue the criminal case against the boys anymore.

A man in China recently received a harsh reminder of that after a wild panda bit his leg after authorities pursued the critter onto his lawn, reports AFP via Yahoo. The creature had made its way into a northwestern village, which is near a sanctuary that's home to about 100 wild pandas.  I saw a panda jump out in front of me, its body completely covered in mud,  the man told local news. A struggle ensued, in which the bear wouldn't release the man's leg until a rescuer wrapped a coat around the animal's head. Finally, it fled—but not before causing injuries which, China Daily reports, led to eight surgeries over the past year and may lead to amputation. The man sued three government departments and won an $83,000 payout that will cover his medical costs, his lawyer says. (China Daily has a pretty gruesome photo of the injury.)

"(Jan 6, 2016  2:23 PM) It's starting to seem like America is an expensive place to get a disease. Bloomberg reports sofosbuvir—a Hepatitis C  miracle cure —that retails for $1,000 per pill in the US is currently going for $4.29 in India, and that price is continuing to drop. Like other pharmaceutical companies, Gilead Sciences is making generic versions of its drug available in developing countries. More than a dozen generic versions of sofosbuvir, which can get rid of Hepatitis C in just three months, are currently being sold by multiple companies in India. And those companies are constantly lowering prices to gain a bigger market share.  If one agrees to it, the others will also have to,  an Indian gastroenterologist tells Bloomberg.  It’s a race where one cannot say no—because then they’re going to lose the business.  These cheap, generic versions of sofosbuvir are great for India, where at least 12 million people—and up to 50% of the population in some areas—have Hepatitis C, Bloomberg reports. But in the US, the steep price—nearly $95,000 for a 12-week course—is limiting access, according to aidsmap.com. A recent study found almost 25% of people with chronic Hepatitis C have their initial requests for sofosbuvir denied by insurance companies. That number lowers to less than 10% after appeals—but appeals take time away from treatment. Insurance companies often require patients to have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis before they agree to take on the cost of sofosbuvir. Bloomberg reports Medicaid is also limiting access to sofosbuvir. Gilead, which has faced criticism over high prices from the US Senate, stands behind its pricing.",Hepatitis-Curing Pill Costs 233 Times More in US Than India
"(Nov 1, 2017  8:49 AM CDT) The toddler in the extra-large T-shirt was sitting between sliding glass doors at Amarillo Airport when a security guard found her late one night in September 1977, clasping a bottle of spoiled juice. Faded bruises signaled a troubled past, one from which the blonde, brown-eyed girl, aged 16 to 18 months, had been abandoned. Dubbed Jane Doe 927, the toddler was adopted by a loving family and rechristened Shelley Schooley. Her past would remain a mystery for four decades. Now the Amarillo Globe-News reports a DNA test could unlock those secrets. That is, if the mother of two decides to take it. Until now, Schooley says, she never wanted to pursue her  missing link.  In a 2015 YouTube video, Schooley explains,  It's never mattered to me. I have my family and I wouldn't trade them for anything.  Meanwhile in 1998, a woman named Pattie Whitaker posted on a genealogy forum that she  will not give up  searching for her niece, Bonnie Lee Webster, who disappeared in 1977. The 18-month-old was apparently abandoned by Whitaker's late sister, who never explained what happened to the child. Genealogy sleuth Rona Randall saw the post and found an old newspaper photo of Jane Doe 927—a  perfect match  to baby Bonnie. Last month, Randall found Schooley and put her in touch with Whitaker. Schooley tells the Globe-News she can't justify the expense of the DNA test with two sons to raise. But, she adds, she may do it if the truth provides  closure  for Whitaker, her probable aunt.

"(Nov 23, 2010  8:23 AM) Despite the uproar over the TSA's enhanced security procedures, a new poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans actually support the new full-body scanners. Even so, only 48% believe the enhanced pat-downs are justified, according to the Washington Post-ABC News poll. Some 68% of those surveyed said the government must investigate possible terrorist activity even if it invades personal privacy, and 64% support the new scanners as a method of doing so. The high numbers still aren't as high as the last poll that was publicized, which showed a full 81% of Americans supported the scanners. Even though about a third saw the machines as a potential health risk, 45% of those people supported them nonetheless. And it breaks down about evenly between the parties: 69% of Democrats support the scanners compared to 65% of Republicans, and 52% of Democrats support the pat-downs while 49% of Republicans do. Regardless of how they feel, 71% say the new procedures won't make a difference in how often they fly, while 10% say they'll actually fly more. As for the alternative?

He is identified as Scott Michael Greene, a 46-year-old white male. Authorities say he surrendered to a Department of Natural Resources officer without a struggle and was in the custody of the Iowa State Patrol. Police have not speculated about a motive. The first officer, from the Urbandale department, was shot about 1:06am Wednesday at an intersection. The second officer, from the Des Moines department, was shot and killed about 20 minutes later while responding to the first shooting.

"(Apr 22, 2014  7:30 AM CDT) The US military has said at least 10,000 troops must remain in Afghanistan in order to continue training Afghan forces while also keeping themselves safe—but the White House is now telling Reuters that State Department and Pentagon officials are considering dropping well below that threshold, possibly leaving fewer than 5,000 soldiers in the country after the US-led mission ends this year. White House officials reportedly believe the Afghan security forces are now strong enough to contain the Taliban insurgency, while any remaining US troops focus on counterterrorism or training. That belief was bolstered by Afghanistan's April 5 general election, which saw huge voter turnout and no high-profile attacks. But some US military officials expect the Taliban to increase attacks when US forces and other Western troops, including the British, leave the country, and think that Afghanistan's forces could grow weaker at that point. That matter is still cause for debate in Washington—debate that's ongoing as the US and Afghanistan still have not finalized a Bilateral Security Agreement authorizing the continued presence of American troops in the country beyond this year. It may not end up finalized until President Hamid Karzai's successor takes office; results of the presidential election could take weeks or even months to determine.",US May Leave Less Than 5K Troops in Afghanistan

Sloan Briles, 35, who pleaded guilty to felony child abuse, will also have to attend a year of child abuse treatment and will serve three years probation. Prosecutors had sought jail time, and he faced a possible six years behind bars. Briles was on the cruise with his girlfriend and two young sons when he poked and repeatedly slapped one of his boys in the face. When the boy cried and told his dad to stop hurting him, Briles hoisted his son up over the ship rail and heaved him into Orange County's busy Newport Harbor, reports the Los Angeles Times.  There were lots of other boats in the water,  said a spokeswoman for the district attorney. The vessel maneuvered to try to block other boats from hitting the boy, and one craft had to veer sharply to avoid striking him. The cruise's pilot tossed him a life-saving ring while another boat fished him out. Briles, who was drunk at the time, leaped into the water to escape furious passengers, reports the Orange County Register.

"(Dec 28, 2013  11:06 AM) The number of reported sexual assaults in the military rose by more than 50% this year, but defense officials say that figure is actually a sign of progress. Heightened attention to the problem is causing more people to come forward as they gain confidence in the system, they say. More than 5,000 reports of sexual assault were filed during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, compared to the 3,374 in 2012, according to early data obtained by the AP. The increase in reports across the services ranges from a low of about 45% for the Air Force to a high of 86% for the Marines, the smallest service. The Navy had an increase of 46% and the Army, by far the largest military service, had a 50% jump. While cautious in their conclusions, officials said surveys, focus groups, and repeated meetings with service members throughout the year suggest that the number of actual incidents—from unwanted sexual contact and harassment to violent assaults—remained largely steady.  More likely, we have people who understand what sexual assault is,  said Jill Loftus, director of the Navy's sexual assault program, which also includes the Marine Corps. And, she said, officials are hearing that more people are confident that their reports will be taken seriously.",Reported Sex Assaults Surge 50% in US Military
"(Jan 23, 2013  12:44 PM) The AR-15 semiautomatic rifle is getting vilified in the media, but two female essayists at the National Review explain why it's their weapon of choice for self-defense. Simply put, it's a great gun—light, easy to shoot, and accurate, write Celia Bigelow and Aubrey Blankenship. In this age of violence, especially against women,  pepper spray, mace, or five-round handheld pistols aren't going to cut it,  they write. The AR-15 is easily the best option out there, and  we wouldn't want to be stuck at home without one.  Critics may hate high-capacity magazines, but the essayists think of them as  a life-saving insurance mechanism —that is, when an intruder invades your home, you might not get a chance to reload.  As women, we should possess the right to best defend ourselves against (violence) whether with a handgun or our much preferred AR-15,  they write.

"(Jun 3, 2013  12:01 PM CDT) A Wisconsin town might have finally figured out a way to deal with childhood bullies: fine their parents. As part of an anti-bullying ordinance that passed in Monona late last month, parents of repeat offenders can be ticketed by police and fined up to $114 the first time, and $177 for any other violations during the same year. Before the first fine, parents would be warned that their children were on notice, the Wisconsin State Journal reports, and those who are really trying to deal with the behavior would not be ticketed. The director of the National Bullying Prevention Center says she knows of no other similar tactic. And the executive director of a bullying prevention nonprofit calls the move  fantastic.

The Los Angeles Times notes speculation had arisen on just that possibility—Captain Marvel actress Lashana Lynch and Knives Out star Ana de Armas are two names it mentions—but Barbara Broccoli says that's not going to happen on her watch. Bond  can be of any color, but he is male,  she tells Variety.  I believe we should be creating new characters for women—strong female characters. I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.  Not that Broccoli isn't considering other big moves for the Bond franchise: She's open to debuting the next incarnation on a streaming service like Netflix.  We make these films for the audiences,  she says.  We like to think that they're going to be seen primarily on the big screen, but ... our fans are the ones who dictate how they want to consume their entertainment.  As for the departure of Craig, who's starred in five Bond films, Broccoli is still trying to wrap her head around it.  I've accepted what Daniel has said, but I'm still in denial,  she says.

"(May 29, 2012  11:33 PM CDT) No history of American folk and country music would be complete without a mention of blind guitar wizard Doc Watson, who has died at the age of 89. His rapid-fire flatpicking style influenced generations of musicians, and helped elevate the guitar to lead instrument status in the country music of the '50s and '60s, AP notes. Watson—who grew up in a corner of North Carolina that has produced countless folk musicians—lost his eyesight when he was just a year old, and was playing the banjo by the time he was five. His serious music career only began when he was in his 40s and was discovered by a folklorist—but he went on to record 60 albums, seven of which won Grammy awards. He founded the Merlefest music festival in 1985 after the death of his son, who toured with him for many years. Watson, who enjoyed touring right up until the end of his life, changed folk music forever by adapting fiddle tunes to the guitar, notes Nashville guitarist Pete Huttlinger.

"(May 10, 2019  1:53 PM CDT) What should have been a feel-good story has since turned tragic. The BBC reports on the turn of events that started in the Philippines in February, where 24-year-old Birgitte Kallestad was on vacation with friends. Per a statement given to the Daily Mail, via the New York Post, Kallestad and her pals were zipping around on mopeds when they spotted a stray puppy on the side of the road. Kallestad put the dog in her bike basket and the group went back to their resort. They all bathed and played with the puppy, which gave its new friends small bites and scratches during their playtime. Kallestad, who works at a Norwegian hospital, cleaned up her own tiny wounds but didn't think she needed any other medical help. That proved to be a fatal mistake. Soon after Kallestad returned home she started feeling ill, but she didn't tie it to her puppy interaction, and during multiple visits to the hospital, doctors weren't initially thinking rabies—until she was sick enough to be admitted full time at the Forde hospital where she worked. A physician finally suspected rabies, and tests confirmed Kallestad had the disease on Saturday. It was too late: She died Monday, eight days after she'd been admitted. It's the first rabies-related death in Norway in more than 200 years. Even though many countries are on a list that recommends tourists get rabies vaccines before visiting, the Philippines wasn't on it, and Kallestad's family is now trying to change that.

Documents released by the state's agriculture department show that the group placed 24 animals in 2011—and killed 1,911.  It appears PETA is more concerned with funding its media and advertising antics than finding suitable homes for these dogs and cats,  says the head of the Center for Consumer Freedom, which posted the documents online. PETA lacks  sufficient animal enclosures  to house the number of animals it reportedly takes in, says an investigator, who adds that the group kills 84% of the animals it receives within 24 hours. A rep for the group didn't contest the figures, but told the Daily Caller that it only kills animals due to  injury, illness, age, aggression, or because no good homes exist for them.

"(Feb 15, 2008  5:29 AM) A sixth victim of the gunman who opened fire in an Illinois college classroom yesterday has died and at least four more remain in critical condition. The assailant, a former grad student at Northern Illinois University, entered through a door to the right of the lecture stage and silently started shooting. He fired a shotgun at the more than 100 students in Geology 104, then shot and wounded the instructor with a handgun, and then shot himself. One of the victims, Daniel Parmentier, was shot in the head while sitting in the front row of the auditorium; his girlfriend, sitting next to him, was also killed. Students who fled the lecture hall jumped over others who were ducking for safety. Some crawled to the exits, as at least 22 were struck by bullets.  It didn't look like he was aiming directly at someone,  said one survivor.  I think he was trying to hit as many people as he could.",6th Student Dies in NIU Shooting
"(Feb 23, 2016  8:22 AM) About to buy the new Galaxy S7? Your contact list just got a whole lot bigger. Samsung and Whitepages are announcing a partnership that packs caller ID, spam and scam detection, and even a nearby business search directly into the native dialer, reports Engadget. This means that an incoming call will automatically reveal any info Whitepages has on the number—meaning unknown numbers you'd formerly be wary of should be more obviously pick-up worthy (it's your dentist) or ignore-at-all-costs (that IRS scam everybody's been talking about). And it's about time, with Whitepages tracking a 34% jump in spam and scam calls between 2014 and 2015, the Seattle-based tech company reported in a December Business Wire news release. Caller ID, of course, isn't new, and Whitepages already boasts Android and iPhone apps. Whitepages inked a similar deal with T-Mobile in 2014, but Engadget observes that  it's rare for such a service to be integrated into a flagship phone.  It makes sense, given Whitepages has info on some 1.5 billion numbers worldwide, 600 million of which are US-based, reports GeekWire.

Anyone visiting any of the three states from places that are considered coronavirus hot spots will have to quarantine for 14 days, the BBC reports.  We worked very hard to get the viral transmission down,  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. He made the announcement in a press conference with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, per WNBC.  The last thing we need to do right now is to subject our folks to another round,  Murphy said. The requirement takes effect Thursday. A total of more than 41,000 people in the three states have died in the pandemic, but New York's fatalities have dropped from nearly 800 a day to fewer than 30. The order will apply to anyone coming from a state in which 10 of every 100,000 people test positive on a rolling seven-day basis, or a state where 10% of the population has tested positive for the virus. As of now, Cuomo said, those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah, and Texas. The list will be updated, he said. Florida, Texas and Arizona are among the states posting their highest rates of the pandemic. Hotels will have to inform guests of the rule, and signs will be posted in airports and along roads. In New York, the penalty for a first violation of the rule is a $2,000 fine, per CNN.

Per People Chica, AB Quintanilla—full name: Abraham Quintanilla, per a Facebook post by the Nueces County Sheriff's Office—is one of the top 10 fugitives in Corpus Christi for the month of August, with a warrant out for his arrest for contempt of court and unpaid child support. The 53-year-old Quintanilla—a musician who used to perform with his younger sister's group, Selena y Los Dinos, and who more recently founded Los Kumbia Kings and Elektro Kumbia—is said to have six sons and two daughters. KZTV reports he owed close to $90,000 as of July, per court documents. Quintanilla was nailed in 2015 for only making a handful of payments over four years and ordered by a Nueces County court in August of that year to make nearly $37,000 in back payments and interest, notes the San Antonio Express-News. It's unclear how much, if any, he paid up toward that figure, though KRIS notes that paperwork from the Texas Attorney General's office indicates the last payment he made was in September 2015, for $16.84.

So a judge ruled this week after a couple sued the city of Bellingham and the city employee who admitted to making the videos in 2015 at the Arne Hanna Aquatic Center, the Bellingham Herald reports. The employee, 55-year-old David Alan Frick, didn't appear at the Tuesday decision in Whatcom County Superior Court.  You are a survivor of sexual assault, don't let anybody tell you different,  Judge Raquel Montoya-Lewis told the woman, awarding her $750,000 and her husband $250,000. Unidentified as a survivor of sexual harassment or assault, the woman says her marriage has been altered and she felt emotional pain and anxiety.  I had a lot of emotions going through my head, super angry, I felt guilty for a weird reason, just very confused because that seemed like a big shock, and unlike him,  she says.  I felt like I was sexually assaulted but it felt like I didn’t have physical evidence to say I was, it was very confusing.  The court dismissed their suit against the city itself, saying Bellingham didn't benefit from Frick's actions, but her attorney says he plans to appeal. Meanwhile, five other women have sued Frick and the city, the Herald notes, and the Herald also reports that detectives found child pornography in his home.

"(Dec 6, 2011  12:46 AM) Two men who have accused a dead Boston Red Sox clubhouse manager of sexually abusing them when they were batboys are filing a $10 million lawsuit against the team.  These were inner city kids happy to have jobs with the Red Sox,  said their lawyer yesterday.  Then they were sexually molested by Donald Fitzpatrick, a serial pedophile. It's similar to the Penn State case.  Fitzpatrick died in 2005 at the age of 76. The team settled a $3.15 million lawsuit with seven Florida men in 2003 who accused Fitzpatrick of molesting them during spring training in the 1970s, and Fitzpatrick pleaded guilty in 2002 to four counts of attempted sexual battery. The team also paid $100,000 to a former clubhouse attendant who charged that he was assaulted during a team trip. This is the first time accusations have involved incidents at Fenway Park, according to the Boston Globe. One of the men in the current lawsuit, Charles Crawford, said Fitzpatrick assaulted him twice in 1991—in a restroom and an equipment room at Fenway—when he was a 16-year-old batboy.  I’ve held one of Boston’s darkest secrets all these years, knowing people would have been blown out of their seats if they knew what the Red Sox let happen to me,’’ he said. A Red Sox attorney said officials were unaware of the incidents in the lawsuit, but that the team has  always viewed the actions of Mr. Fitzpatrick to be abhorrent.  When the Sox became aware of other allegations against Fitzpatrick in 1991, the manager was  promptly relieved of his duties,  the attorney added.

Several days into their work leveling land, the laborers found 16 gold bars and 600 gold coins from the 1920s buried in glass jars, perhaps during World War II, the BBC reports. Police say the men—ages 20, 33, and 40—sold the loot to a local coin collector, then bought cars and motorcycles and invested the money in their homes or life insurance policies.

His admission of guilt got him a two-year jail sentence, but police say it didn't stop him from practicing medicine once he was released—or prevent him from botching one more surgery. A 55-year-old male says he went to the resident of Tamarac, Fla., in order to correct what was already a poorly executed penile procedure done in March 2014, reports NBC Miami: He needed to have  filler  material that had been injected in his member in the hopes of lengthening and thickening it removed. The patient paid Schreiber $1,000 cash, was given five pills, passed out, and woke to what the Sun Sentinel describes as a  deformed, one-inch-long penis.  The warrant contains some graphic details: The man took off his bandages to find  his penis had retracted so far that it protruded less than one inch from his body.  Schreiber's advice, according to the patient, was to  just put two sticks [on] either side of his penis and wrap it up to keep it straight.  He's now left with a mutilated penis and an inability to engage in sexual activity. Following an investigation, Schreiber was arrested Friday and was as of yesterday being held on one count of unlicensed practice of health care causing serious injury.

Thiago Henrique Gomes da Rocha, a security guard who lives with his mother, cruised the streets and gunned down his victims—young women, homeless people, and transvestites—from his motorcycle, say police, who were  shocked by his coldness  during interrogations, the BBC reports. Investigators say he would shout  Robbery!  when approaching his victims before shooting them dead and leaving without their valuables. A gun linked to the killings of at least six women was found in his home, an investigator tells the AP. Police say Gomes da Rocha—who has given them details of each murder and referred to his victims by the numbers 1 to 39—has told them he killed his victims to release the  fury  he felt  against everything.  The spate of unexplained killings in the city in central Brazil provoked public anger and panic, with family members and friends staging demonstrations to up the pressure on police, and the suspect was caught by a special task force after he was stopped while riding a motorcycle with a fake license plate, reports the Daily Mail.

That's the issue now faced by the Federal Election Commission in terms of its legal counsel: Next month will hit the two-year mark of the agency missing a lead attorney, NBC News reports. As first reported by the Center for Public Integrity, the organization responsible for enforcing federal election law is down a key player right before 2016 campaigning kicks into high gear, gridlock caused mainly by infighting among the six FEC commissioners: Conservatives want an attorney who's not a  bomb-thrower  and will support  minimal restrictions  on campaign funds, while liberals are vying for someone who will more tightly rein in campaign spending, the CPI notes. It had appeared late last year the agency was close to making an offer to one of two candidates, but the commissioners were deadlocked on one contender, and the other one took a job somewhere else, the center reports. Other things that may be holding up filling the post: no ads on the federal government's jobs website and a salary (promoted last year as $147,200) that some say is too modest for the role. It probably also doesn't help that, per the Times,  some commissioners are barely on speaking terms … [and] cross-aisle negotiations are infrequent.

That's per a statement from the country's tourism ambassador to the UK, announcing an unusual approach to boost tourism within its borders during the pandemic: an offer of $3,000 to any visitor who contracts the coronavirus there, Vice reports.  We want to reassure tourists they can come to Uzbekistan,  adds Sophie Ibbotson in the statement. The $3,000 figure was arrived at because that's about the cost of the medical care that Uzbekistan citizens get for free get if they're infected. It's all part of the nation's  Safe Travel Guaranteed  campaign, given the OK by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to coax travelers back. The compensation is conditional: The tourist must have been exploring Uzbekistan with a local tour guide who's been certified in safety and hygiene guidelines. There's a reason why the country is making this investment: Insider notes it's the fourth fastest-growing tourism market, according to UN stats. Currently Uzbekistan is welcoming back visitors from low-risk nations like Japan and South Korea; those coming from elsewhere will have to self-quarantine for 14 days when they get there.

The AFP reports that the claim stems from documents uncovered by one historian that indicate that King Edward IV, ruler for most of 1461 to 1483, may have been illegitimate. If true, it would mean that Edward's younger brother, George—from whom Hastings is directly descended—should actually have assumed the throne, and Hastings would have eventually inherited the crown.

"(Oct 6, 2017  7:06 AM CDT) An Illinois man known for honoring the victims of mass shootings around the country installed 58 white crosses on the Las Vegas Strip on Thursday. Greg Zanis drove nearly 2,000 miles from the Chicago area to install the crosses on a patch of grass near the iconic  Welcome to Las Vegas  sign, not far from the site of the Route 91 Harvest country music festival where the victims were killed on Sunday night, per the AP. The 66-year-old retired carpenter made his first cross 20 years ago when his father-in-law was killed. That just changed my life,  Zanis says.  My first cross was for somebody that I loved. And when I put up these crosses here, I always think of my personal loss here too. Always.  Zanis has become well-known for erecting more than 20,000 of the markers over the past two decades, including after the Columbine and Sandy Hook school shootings and the massacre at an Orlando nightclub. The crosses, which Zanis says took him two days to cut and paint, feature a red heart. He plans to keep the tribute up for 40 days before giving the crosses to the families of the victims.

"(Oct 27, 2009  10:04 AM CDT) President Obama will roll out a plan to use $3.4 billion in stimulus funds to modernize the nation’s electrical grid today. The  smart grid  spending will go to private contractors, utilities, and municipal governments in grants of between $400,000 and $2 million. The administration expects $4.7 billion in private investment to match the taxpayer money, and predicts the spending will create tens of thousands of new jobs. In addition to job creation, the administration has touted likely savings on electricity for consumers, and the mitigation of economic damage caused by power outages, which will be less frequent and easier to fix with a smart grid. New technology will also allow consumers to tap into renewable sources of energy.  The smart grid is something that has a transformational impact on how energy is delivered,  a presidential energy adviser tells Politico.

"(Apr 14, 2015  3:55 AM CDT) A notebook that sheds light on how British mathematician Alan Turing helped invent modern computing—and win World War II—was sold for just over $1 million at an auction in New York yesterday. The 56-page handwritten notebook dates from 1942, when Turing was helping crack Nazi Germany's Enigma code and turn the tide of the war, reports Reuters. Bonhams auction house, which sold an Enigma machine for $269,000 at the same auction, says a portion of the proceeds will go to charity and adds that the sale is a  wonderful result and a fitting testament to Alan Turing's impact and legacy,  the Telegraph reports. The auction house says Turing's notes show how he was  working on logic and the foundations of mathematics with the aim of creating a universal language for a universal computing machine.  Turing, who reportedly committed suicide in 1954, left the notebook to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy, who used the blank pages for a dream journal and some deeply personal messages, the Financial Times reports.  It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited,  wrote Gandy, who died in 1995.

He had slimmed down to around 867 pounds in recent years but remained bedridden at his mother's home in Monterrey. Officials say he was taken to the hospital—by crane—earlier this month because of an abnormal heartbeat. Uribe made the news in 2008, when he got married for the second time.

That makes him the oldest rider to even finish the race, the New York Times reports.  It's nothing,  says the Idaho native.  You just ride 650 miles on a death march.  That meant riding about 100 hours on 28 horses and outpacing 43 other competitors across rivers, dunes, wetland, valleys, and forested hills, often alone. It also meant training for months with previous race winners and preparing thoughtful touches, like taking blue ribbons to honor his horses, and baggies with two cigarettes and a pocketknife for herdsmen.  Preparation trumps youth,  says Long. But he was determined after seeing a documentary about the race, All the Wild Horses.  It took me about 15 minutes to decide that I could do that,  he says. An accomplished amateur rider, he endured a scary horse fall into a muddy trench and stayed sane on long stretches partly by singing  There's a Coach Comin' In  from the movie Paint Your Wagon (1969), he tells Forbes.

"(Feb 16, 2017  3:36 AM) Investigators trying to piece together the stunning assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother believe the murder at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday took just 10 seconds. Kim Jong Nam was preparing to return to his home in Macau from a week in Malaysia when he encountered two attractive women in the airport's busy Terminal 2, the Washington Post reports, citing interviews with airport staff and police. One woman grabbed Kim while the other sprayed liquid on his face and held a cloth on it for around 10 seconds. The pair then made a leisurely getaway, strolling through the terminal and waiting in line for a taxi, while their victim staggered to a counter seeking help before dying in an ambulance. The fast-acting poison the women apparently used is typical of North Korean assassination attempts, according to the Post. Results from an autopsy, which North Korean diplomats reportedly tried to prevent, have not been made public. The BBC reports that two women have been arrested in connection with the case: A woman traveling on a Vietnamese passport who was arrested Wednesday, and a suspect with an Indonesian passport arrested Thursday.

"(Feb 4, 2015  8:50 AM) More details from  one of the darkest chapters of Australia's maritime history  are coming to light, nearly 400 years after they occurred. On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered  by accident.  Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more:  This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia—albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here—so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.  (The tragic story behind three partial skeletons was recently revealed, more than 160 years later.)","More Secrets of 1629 Mutiny, Murder Unearthed"

"(Oct 31, 2011  11:42 AM CDT) Halloween may seem the perfect day for the world population to reach 7 billion—after all, it’s a terrifying milestone, right? Wrong, writes economist David Lam, president of the Population Association of America, in the Los Angeles Times.  The parents of the 7-billionth person should not be afraid for their child's future,  he notes. That child  will almost surely have a better life than the 3-billionth or 6-billionth child.  Because, for one thing, the fastest population growth the world has seen ... has already occurred. The 3-billionth child was born in 1960, and the population doubled in 39 years. Thanks to falling fertility rates, it's unlikely that it will double again.  We may never get much above the 10.1 billion people projected for 2100,  Lam notes. We survived the biggest population explosion, which makes now  a good time to look back and see how  we did it. Though distribution problems persist, over the past half-century, world food production has increased faster than population. Education has improved, and poverty rates have dropped—even in hardest-hit sub-Saharan Africa. There are big challenges ahead, acknowledges Lam, but  the remarkable experience of the last 50 years  proves we needn’t be scared to  celebrate the birth of the 7-billionth child.",7B People Isn't as Terrifying as It Sounds

"(Jul 21, 2017  2:19 AM CDT) Exxon Mobil Corp. must pay a $2 million fine for showing  reckless disregard  for US sanctions on Russia while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was the oil giant's CEO, the Treasury Department said Thursday. Exxon sued the US government to stop the fine. The Treasury said that Exxon violated sanctions when it signed contracts in May 2014 with Russian oil magnate Igor Sechin, chairman of government-owned energy giant Rosneft, the AP reports. The US blacklisted Sechin, Tillerson's longtime business associate, as part of its response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The same month that Exxon signed the deals, Tillerson said the company generally opposes sanctions and finds them  ineffective.  Exxon maintained it had done nothing wrong. Hours after the fine was announced, the Texas-based company sued Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the government, saying the US had clearly told companies that doing business with Rosneft was allowed—just not with Sechin himself. Tillerson, who has recused himself from matters dealing with his former company, has insisted the sanctions will stay in place until Russia reverses course in Ukraine and gives back Crimea.",Exxon Fined $2M for Sanctions Breach Under Tillerson

"(Feb 2, 2012  7:28 AM) One year ago, the US no-fly list was at about 10,000 names; today, it has more than doubled to around 21,000. The list has been growing at a quick clip ever since the failed Christmas 2009  underwear bomber  plot, after which the government lowered the standards required to place people on the list. The new standards would have ensured that would-be bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was on the list, which would have helped officials to catch him before he attempted to carry out his plot, the AP explains. The larger watch list comes even as the US touts the number of senior al-Qaeda members it has killed, but the government says that the country is threatened by many others beyond that group. After the 2009 incident, intelligence agencies began scouring old files for names that should have been added to the terror watch list as well as new names to add based on the new standards. Now, a person can be added to the no-fly list—which includes mostly foreigners but around 500 Americans—even if he or she is considered a general threat, rather than a specific aviation threat.",No-Fly List Has Doubled to 21K Since Last Year

The trustee handling the Madoff bankruptcy filed two lawsuits today to regain $6 billion from two funds that worked closely with the financier. One of the lawsuits, against prominent Florida money manager Jeffry M. Picower and his wife, alleges that the couple knew of Madoff's Ponzi scheme and actually helped him carry it out. Their lawyer disputed the charge.  Mr. and Mrs. Picower considered themselves friends of the Madoffs for over 35 years,  he said.

"(Dec 6, 2019  6:31 AM) R. Kelly is facing a new federal charge tied to his marriage to the late singer Aaliyah, his teenage protege, who was just 15 at the time. Federal prosecutors in the eastern district of New York say Kelly, then 27, and others bribed a public official in Illinois to create a fake ID for a  Jane Doe  on the day before the Aug. 31, 1994, wedding. Their Illinois wedding certificate gave Aaliyah Haughton's age as 18. Kelly's former tour manager and personal assistant, Demetrius Smith, admitted to obtaining the fake ID in Lifetime's Surviving R. Kelly.  I had papers forged for them when Aaliyah was underaged,  he said, per the Guardian. He told the same to journalist Jim DeRogatis, who included the claim in his book Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly, reports NPR. Kelly's lawyer, however, has put the blame on Aaliyah. In January, Steven Greenberg said Aaliyah  did not claim to be 15. And in order to get married, she had to lie about her age.  He added Kelly had  no idea  about her true age. Their marriage was annulled months later. Greenberg now tells the New York Times that the bribery charge  does not appear to materially alter the landscape.  A 25-year-old alleged bribe would normally fall outside the statute of limitations, but prosecutors say it occurred as part of a criminal enterprise. Under a racketeering charge, Kelly is accused of leading an enterprise  to recruit women and girls to engage in illegal sexual activity.  The 52-year-old heads to federal court in Chicago in April to stand trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges. He will then face federal charges of racketeering, kidnapping, forced labor, sexual exploitation, and now bribery, in Brooklyn.","Prosecutors: Here's How R. Kelly Married Aaliyah, 15"

"(Jul 15, 2020  2:58 AM CDT) A former nursing assistant at a VA hospital in West Virginia has pleaded guilty to murdering seven elderly veterans and attempting to kill an eighth. The vets were given insulin injections that led to fatal blood sugar crashes; the victims were largely either not diabetic, or not in need of insulin. Reta Mays, 46, was arrested after authorities noticed an  unusual  number of deaths from severe hypoglycemia in the area between July 2017 and June 2018, NBC News reports.  She denied it for a long time until most recently when she finally recognized the strength of our case,  a US attorney says. No motive has become clear, but the Washington Post reports that at the hearing Tuesday, Mays, an Army National Guard veteran who was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait in the early 2000s, told the judge she was on medication for post-traumatic stress disorder. She was hired at Louis A. Johnson Medical Center in Clarksburg in 2015 and fired last year, seven months after being removed from patient care. With her position on the night shift, few saw her at work.

Per records seen by the Los Angeles Times, Ara Zobayan had been told to stay out of the airspace in the helicopter he was flying for a charter company in May 2015 because bad weather at the time had reduced visibility under what's known as visual flight rules (VFR).

He entered it anyway. Zobayan's violation of federal flight rules earned him an FAA investigation. Per FAA records seen by CNN, Zobayan  was counseled on operating in Class B airspace, special VFR weather minimums, proper planning, reviewing weather, and anticipating required action. He was cooperative and receptive to the counseling.

Globally, Force Awakens has pulled in some $1.5 billion, which puts it at No. 6; Avatar also sits atop that list, with $2.7 billion. Elsewhere at the box office, Daddy's Home brought in $29 million and The Hateful Eight took home $16.2 million.",Force Awakens Is Now No. 2 Domestic Film of All Time
"(May 26, 2008  8:48 PM CDT) Oscar-winning filmmaker Sidney Pollack died of cancer today at age 73 in Los Angeles, the New York Times reports. His career, defined by classics like Tootsie and Out of Africa, spanned an era when directors wrangled stars and battled studios to make artful yet commercial films. He later grieved that mainstream movies are good only by  accident  in today's Hollywood. Pollack started by acting but went behind the camera on advice from Burt Lancaster. Self-critical as a director, he broke through with They Shoot Horses, Don't They? in 1970 and would work with stars like Sally Field, Paul Newman, and Dustin Hoffman. He won an Oscar for Out of Africa and later enjoyed playing elder statesman, leading Hollywood organizations and battling for artists' rights.",Oscar Winner Sydney Pollack Dead at 73
"(Jul 11, 2018  9:25 AM CDT) A member of a neo-Nazi group in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for her role in 10 racially motivated murders, though her lawyer claims she  was demonstrably present at no crime scene and never fired a weapon or detonated a bomb.  Beate Zschaepe, 43, of the National Socialist Underground, denied knowledge of the murders she said were carried out by two male members who have since died by suicide, reports Reuters. Munich's Higher Regional Court found she carried  particularly heavy guilt  for planning the killings between 2000 and 2007, as well as arranging money and alibis. The victims included a German policewoman, eight Turks, and a Greek citizen, per the BBC.

"(Dec 19, 2010  8:29 AM) The longest night of 2010 could well be the darkest winter solstice in 456 years: Tuesday's solstice falls on the same day as a full lunar eclipse, a rare celestial occurrence that for some signifies great cosmic energies, reports the Montreal Gazette. Many religions associate the solstice with the rebirth of the sun, while lunar eclipses are significant especially for Wiccans, because of the interaction between male solar energies and female lunar energies.  The idea that the sun and the moon are almost at their darkest really only further goes to hammer  the idea of rebirth home, a Wiccan priestess says. When winter solstice last crossed paths with a full lunar eclipse in 1554, it was a dark year politically in England, notes the Gazette. But scientists say that it's all just a coincidence.  It's quite rare, but there's no profound significance,  says an astronomy instructor at Carleton University. The eclipse will begin just after midnight ET and last until the moon re-emerges at 5:30am.",First in 456 Years: A Lunar Eclipse on Winter Solstice
"(Apr 2, 2018  11:05 AM CDT)  Affluenza teen  Ethan Couch, now 20 years old, was released Monday after two years behind bars, USA Today reports. Couch gained infamy after driving drunk and killing four people in 2013, when a psychologist testifying for the defense at his trial placed blame on his  affluenza,  the idea that the Texas teen's affluent upbringing caused him to be unable to discern right from wrong or take full responsibility for his actions. He was ultimately sentenced to rehab and 10 years of probation, but he was then sentenced to 720 days behind bars after violating that probation. His mother was jailed Wednesday for violating the conditions of her own bond; she'd been released on bond while awaiting trial for allegedly helping her son run off to Mexico in 2015 when he was in danger of violating his probation. Ethan Couch met with probation officers immediately after his release.  [Couch] will now serve the remaining six years of his period of community supervision under the terms and conditions imposed by the court,  his lawyers said in a statement to ABC News.  From the beginning, Ethan has admitted his conduct, accepted responsibility for his actions, and felt true remorse for the terrible consequences of those actions. Now, nearly five years after this horrific event, Ethan does not wish to draw attention to himself and requests privacy so he may focus on successfully completing his community supervision and going forward as a law-abiding citizen.","'Affluenza Teen,' Now 20, Leaves Jail"

"(Jul 16, 2014  11:42 PM CDT) Israel says it is investigating the death of four boys killed in an airstrike yesterday on a beach in front of a hotel used by many of the journalists covering the Gaza conflict. Witnesses from outlets including ABC and the Guardian saw the attack and its aftermath. A group of boys had been playing among fishermen's shacks when a blast hit one of the shacks, killing one of the boys, witnesses say. As four surviving boys ran away, they were hit by another shell that had apparently targeted them directly, killing three boys and badly injuring another. As the second shell hit,  journalists standing by the terrace wall shouted: 'They are only children,'  Peter Beaumont writes in the Guardian. The dead boys were identified as two brothers and two cousins from the extended Bakr family, aged between 9 and 11.  Based on preliminary results, the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives,  the Israeli military said in a statement.  The reported civilian casualties from this strike are a tragic outcome.  An Israeli military affairs journalist tells the New York Times he has seen information suggesting the beach hut had been identified as a Hamas target, but while the fleeing boys may have been mistaken for militants,  it is a little hard for me to understand this, because the images show that the figures are children.  An uncle of the boys describes the killing as a  cold-blooded massacre  and says  it's a shame they didn't identify them as kids with all of the advanced technology they claim they're using.  Other relatives say the boys had been mostly cooped up inside during the Israeli offensive, and one of them had been beaten the day before for defying his father's order to stay away from the beach. A five-hour cease-fire agreed to by both sides for humanitarian reasons began this morning and Gazans are scrambling to stock up on food, reports the BBC.",Israel: 4 Boys Killed on Gaza Beach 'Tragic Outcome'

Peerless Spirit  Scotch whisky, which comes in a decanter inspired by Lalique perfume bottles, is the sixth and final entry in the Macallan in Lalique  Six Pillars Collection,  per a press release, which also announces the jaw-dropping price for this single-malt  masterpiece,  of which only 450 decanters have been made: $35,000. With notes of cracked black pepper, dark chocolate, cloves, cinnamon, and honey, the whisky is said to be one of the oldest ever released by the Macallan estate. And the story behind the decanter's design shows a bottle just as exquisitely crafted: Lalique's creative director created the bottle to resemble a  single peerless drop  of the high-end liquor, influenced by Rene Lalique's mold-blown, pinched glass method. It's no easy task to bring whisky into its golden years. As Maxim explains, depending on the barrel and the climate, oxidation and exposure to wood can ruin a perfect batch before it even hits 50—making this 65-year-old version  a unicorn that's been perfected by time.   This ... final release continues to showcase the unwavering commitment of both the masters of Lalique and the Macallan to create beautiful and desirable objets d'art,  Macallan's brand director says. It's not the first time the distillery has made big-bucks news: In 2014, a 6-liter Macallan M Imperiale Lalique decanter (one of only four made) sold at auction for a record $628,000, per Forbes.

So far there are 90 charges involved in the case, which involves firefighters from the Fairmont Rural Fire Department and the Orrum Fire Department, and officials say more charges are expected and more arrests could be made.  I don't understand that. I mean, the job might be boring at times, but you don't go creating fires just to have something to put out,  a local, who lives near the Fairmont firehouse, tells WRAL.

On Saturday he returned to the renowned Christian school in Lynchburg, Va., with a warning: You will be disrespected.  Some of the loudest voices for tolerance today have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs,  Pence said, per USA Today.  Be ready.  Pence mentioned the  harsh attacks  he and wife Karen have endured since she went back to teach at a Christian elementary school where, the media pointed out, gay teachers and students are forbidden.  Throughout most of American history, it's been pretty easy to call yourself Christian,  he said.  ...But things are different now.  It was certainly different from his visit in 2016, when everyone with a TV heard Trump crowing about clutching women's genitals.  Shortcomings are no excuse for inaction,  Pence told students at the time. And his comments may have helped—or at least been in sync with the evangelical mood—since roughly 81% of white evangelicals voted for Trump/Pence, more than Mitt Romney in 2012, John McCain in 2008, or George W.

French police warned people to avoid the Saint Charles train station, tweeting that an operation was underway. Soldiers and police took up positions outside the station, which was evacuated, the AP reports. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, the city prosecutor's office told CNN. Three police officials said one woman was stabbed to death; two of the officials said the other woman's throat was slit. The assailant was shot dead by soldiers who were patrolling the station. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that he would travel to the scene. The Guardian notes that the soldiers who opened fire were from Operation Sentinelle, which was launched after the deadly terror attacks in France in 2015. The soldiers—whose numbers are said to range between 7,000 and 10,000—patrol major tourist sites, places of worship, train stations, schools, and airports across France. Earlier this month, four American college students were attacked with acid at the same train station in Marseille.

The winner, after 14 bids, was a New Jersey man who hasn't yet been identified. The card, which features shortstop Honus Wagner, is part of the  T206  set released by the American Tobacco Co. between 1909 and 1911; Wagner's is particularly rare because it went out of circulation after just 200 were released, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Now, only about 60 remain, and just 22 in good enough condition to have been assessed by leading collectibles graders. The $1.2 million price  is about $300,000 more than that of the last Wagner  in similar shape, says the collectibles dealer who ran the auction. A higher-graded Wagner card, bought by Wayne Gretzky in 1991, went on to sell for $2.8 million last year. It's not clear why Wagner's card went out of circulation early; one story says that he didn't want to encourage kids to smoke, while another suggests he didn't want his image used without payment.",'Holy Grail' Baseball Card Sells for $1.2M

Sorry, but there's really nothing you can do to improve your odds … which are about one in 176 million, ABC News reports. Since the pool of numbers never changes (the first five winning balls come from a set that runs 1 to 56; the last one can be any number from 1 to 46),  your chances of winning the jackpot with Mega Millions will always be the same,  says one gaming mathematician, who has not purchased a ticket in 25 years.  It doesn't matter what numbers you pick or the jackpot size.  Of course, that doesn't stop people from coming up with strategies in an attempt to win big with tomorrow's drawing; one programmer created a website to track the numbers that have been drawn, and says some definitely pop up more than others. Even so, he says,  if that kind of analysis truly did produce a winning result, I would be a millionaire by now.  One interesting suggestion: Avoid picking the same numbers as other people. That means you may want to consider taking random numbers rather than choosing your own, since people tend to choose dates—and, since that excludes a fair portion of the number pool, date-pickers are more likely to have to share the winnings.","No, You're Not Going to Win Mega Millions $500M Jackpot"

But scientifically speaking, it's the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.

CNN reports that timing means the moon will appear full tonight, so much so that  people with pretty good eyesight could read by it.  The last time the solstice and Cold Moon were less than 24 hours apart was 2010, reports Quartz, and it won't happen again until 2029.

"(Aug 10, 2015  9:48 AM CDT) For more than 35 years, a Texas man has been in prison even though an appeals court threw out his conviction on a 1976 murder charge that initially had him on death row. Today, 59-year-old Jerry Hartfield returns to court for a retrial, facing a life sentence if convicted of killing a woman who sold tickets at a Bay City bus station. Prosecutors and defense lawyers have haggled over who's to blame for decades of inaction and whether Hartfield's right to a speedy trial has been violated. The trial judge refused to dismiss Hartfield's indictment, but prosecutors did recently take the death penalty off the table, citing a Supreme Court ruling barring execution of mentally impaired people. (At a hearing Friday, a psychologist testified Hartfield's IQ is 67, below the threshold of 70 considered mental impairment.)  Regardless of how the time is parsed out, the delay between the initial conviction in 1977 and the trial ... is extraordinary,  a defense attorney said in court documents. Hartfield was 21 in June 1977 when he was convicted of murdering Eunice Lowe, 55. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Hartfield's capital murder conviction in 1980 because of a jury selection problem and ordered a new trial. Three years later, then-Gov. Mark White commuted Hartfield's sentence to life in prison. It wasn't until 2006 that an inmate told Hartfield that because of the reversal, it appeared there was no sentence to commute. With the jailhouse lawyer's help, Hartfield, who said he learned to read and write in prison, filed a handwritten court writ demanding retrial or release, which was rejected twice. Hartfield took it to the federal courts, where a US district judge agreed in 2009 there was no conviction. The Matagorda County DA says while prosecutors  may be partially responsible  for not retrying Hartfield earlier, the state hasn't acted in bad faith; he adds Hartfield also bears responsibility for not filing for nearly 25 years.",Man in Prison 35 Years Without Conviction Gets New Trial

The rights group also estimates that at least 1,400 people were jailed in the early days of the protests, and another 87 in politically-motivated arrests last week. Many of those prisoners tell tales of abuse and torture, the LA Times reports, speaking to one man who says he was burned with cigarettes and hot oil and beaten with a rubber hose.

After days of testimony from a victim who says she was repeatedly abused by Weberman starting when she was 12, a judge sentenced him to 103 years in prison, just short of the 117-year maximum. During her testimony, the victim, now 18, told Weberman that he  played around with and destroyed lives as if they were your toys, without the slightest bit of mercy.  Weberman's crimes included various sexual acts with minors, sometimes during therapy sessions under the guise of helping girls become more religious. The case is the first in two decades Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes has brought against a member of the Satmar ultra-Orthodox community. While many criticize Hynes for not being aggressive enough toward Hasidic abusers, he says the self-silencing culture of the Satmar community is to blame.

"(Oct 16, 2013  11:38 AM CDT) Sean Edwards, a promising British racer and son of ex-Formula One driver Guy Edwards, died yesterday in a crash during training. He was 26. Edwards, the Porsche Supercup Championship leader, was in the passenger seat as an instructor for a private training session at Queensland Raceway at Willowbank, outside Brisbane, Porsche Motorsport said. A 20-year-old local driver was behind the wheel when the car crashed into a tire wall, hit a barrier, and caught fire. The driver was taken to a hospital and is reported to be in critical condition with severe burns and broken bones. Edwards was recently involved in director Ron Howard's movie Rush about the 1976 Formula One season. Guy Edwards was one of the drivers who helped pull Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix. Hartmut Kristen, Head of Motorsport at Porsche, described the younger Edwards as  one of the most popular and successful  drivers in the Porsche series. Edwards won the Nurburgring and Dubai 24 Hours this year. The British Motor Sports Association said:  Sean was a hugely promising young racer who came through the junior formulas in Britain before making a career in international sports car racing.","Promising Racer, 26, Dead in Training Crash"

Prosecutors in Chiapas state said Tuesday that most of the children were between two and 15 years old, but three babies aged between 3 and 20 months were also found during a raid Monday at the house in the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, the AP reports. San Cristobal is a picturesque, heavily Indigenous city that is popular among tourists. It is not unusual to see children and adults hawking local crafts like carvings and embroidered cloth on its narrow cobblestone streets.

The sea has started to come inland, it forced us to move up to the hilltop and rebuild our village there away from the sea,  he says. Nararo is one of six islands in the Solomon Islands to be severely eroded by rising sea levels, which are climbing seven to 10 millimeters per year in the area, or three times the global average. Nuatambu Island has lost half of its habitable land since 2011, and Taro in Choiseul province may soon become the world's first provincial capital to be abandoned due to climate change, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. But another five uninhabited reef islands have vanished entirely, according to a new study—the first that scientifically  confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people,  researchers say, per the Guardian. Scientists used sea-level records, wave models, and aerial and satellite imagery from 1947 to 2015 to evaluate sea level changes in 33 reef islands, they write at the Conversation. The 21 exposed to  higher wave energy in addition to sea-level rise experienced greatly accelerated loss compared with more sheltered islands.  The remaining 12, situated in a low wave energy area,  experienced little noticeable change in shorelines despite being exposed to similar sea-level rise.  Villagers forced to flee sometimes find space on ancestral land. But  the majority of land is tightly controlled by traditional owners, so moving one group of people onto other peoples' lands has been the source of ethnic conflict,  a study author tells the Washington Post.

The agreement, so vague it doesn't even say which year is to be used as a starting point, is unlikely to spur the immediate changes needed to avert possible catastrophe. The  fuzzy-minded statement  is especially disappointing because China and India had signaled their readiness to act before 2020 in concert with developed nations, breaking a long-standing stalemate on who should cut emissions first, Walsh writes.

"(May 4, 2016  6:21 AM CDT) Imagine wiping out the entire population of Orlando, Fla., each year. That's essentially what medical errors are doing, according to an analysis of four studies on the topic that was published in the BMJ on Tuesday. It finds that about 9.5% of Americans who die each year are killed by a medical error, making it the No. 3 cause of death behind heart disease and cancer. Combine all annual deaths from guns, suicide, and car accidents, double them, and that still wouldn't add up to the 251,454 people the Johns Hopkins researchers estimate fall victim to medical errors each year. And that number may be underplaying things.  We believe this understates the true incidence of death due to medical error because the studies cited rely on errors extractable in documented health records and include only inpatient deaths,  reads the study. Those records are hampered by the way we report medical errors: poorly. The CDC doesn't track these, and the New York Times notes it is not a cause of death that would appear on a death certificate. (The researchers would like to see a  preventable complication  field added to death certificates.) The study notes that  the most commonly cited estimate of annual deaths from medical error  is a 1999 Institute of Medicine report that put the ceiling at 98,000 deaths, and the head of health care quality at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center tells the Washington Post that what's happened in the 17 years since that report is  discouraging and alarming : Basically, there has been no improvement, with the exception of hospital-acquired infections.","America's No. 3 Killer Is Medical Errors, Says Study"

Ronald Bert Smith Jr., 45, was pronounced dead at 11:05pm, about 30 minutes after the procedure began at the state prison in southwest Alabama. Smith was convicted of capital murder in the Nov. 8, 1994, fatal shooting of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. A jury voted 7-5 to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, but a judge overrode that recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. Smith, who pistol-whipped Wilson and shot him in the head, replied,  No ma'am  when asked by the prison warden if he had any final words. US Supreme Court justices put the execution on hold twice Thursday as Smith's attorneys argued for a delay, saying a judge shouldn't have been able to impose the death penalty when a jury recommended he receive life imprisonment. Four liberal justices said they would have halted the execution, but five were needed to do so. As the execution began, Smith heaved and coughed repeatedly, clenching his fists and raising his head, the AP reports. A prison guard performed two consciousness checks before the final two lethal drugs were administered. During the first one, Smith moved his arm, according to the AP. He slightly raised his right arm again after the second consciousness test. The state prison commissioner said he did not see any reaction.  We do know we followed our protocol.

It's not exactly the aroma you want from your beer, but it's what scientists say they detected after analyzing two bottles of beer that had been shipwrecked for what's believed to be 170 years at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. Beer isn't known for aging well, and these bottles, found off the coast of Finland in 2010, suffered less-than-ideal conditions: Actual seawater had entered in through the corks. But that didn't stop the intrepid scientists from inserting needles into those corks to remove some of the contents and perform chemical analyses on what they describe as a  bright golden yellow  liquid  with little haze  it. They even braved tiny sips of the liquid, reports Popular Science. Writing in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, the scientists say the beer smelled of  autolyzed yeast, dimethyl sulfide, Bakelite, burnt rubber, over-ripe cheese, and goat, with phenolic and sulfury notes.  Both beers contained live and dead bacteria, which likely caused the  unpleasant organoleptic features.  As for the taste, Popular Science notes the researchers identified flavor chemicals not unlike those found in today's beers. And because the beer was diluted by as much as 30% with seawater, the scientists surmise that the alcohol content was higher than what it measured at: 2.8% and 3.2% ABV.

"(Dec 4, 2016  12:59 PM) It is well established that humans across languages and cultures have a tendency to use more positive words than negative ones. This is called linguistic positivity bias (LPB), but why the phenomenon exists remains unclear. Now researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that their big data analysis of 200 years of words in Google Books (1.3 million texts from 1800 to 2000) and New York Times archives (14.9 million articles since 1851) suggests that the ratio of positive to negative written words  correlates strongly  with the Misery Index (which measure economic health) and war casualties. They also found that LPB has been on the decline, with researcher Morteza Dehghani calling it,  very generally, an indicator that happiness may be on the decline in the US.  But outside scientists urge caution when interpreting the results. The New York Times says the study does offer up evidence that objective circumstances (like war deaths and the economy, as noted above) and subjective happiness can alter our language, there are confounding factors at play in terms of citing a centuries-long decline. UPenn linguistics prof Mark Liberman, for instance, takes issue with the database of 907 words run against the texts, and give the example of  awesome,  which has evolved from meaning  daunting  to  excellent.  The researchers acknowledge that  our results ... encourage the development of more precise tools for inferring psychological states from historical texts.

"(Jul 3, 2015  2:50 PM CDT) Relations between the US and Cuba are warming, but apparently not fast enough for two Cuban baseball players. The pair defected while in the United States for a series of games against US collegians.

An earlier report from Jit said outfielder Yadiel Hernandez also defected. The 25-year-old La O batted .329 in the Cuban league last season for Santiago. Hernandez is a 28-year-old who averaged .355 for Matanzas in 2014-15.

Within a week, however, the 32-year-old was back in the hospital with a strep infection, and she died on July 4, reports the Hartford Courant.

"(Feb 1, 2017  9:37 AM) Democrats found a way Tuesday to use the Senate's own rules to stall two of President Trump's Cabinet nominees. On Wednesday, Republicans retaliated in the simplest of ways: They changed those rules. As a result, the names of Treasury nominee Steve Mnuchin and Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price have advanced to the Senate floor for final confirmation, reports the Hill. The procedural maneuvering began Tuesday, when every Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee boycotted scheduled votes on the pair, saying neither had properly answered background questions. That effectively stopped the process because committee rules say at least one member from each party must be present for a vote to take place. On Wednesday, Democrats boycotted again, so Republicans on the panel agreed to ditch the one-member-present rule. Voila: Both nominees advanced by votes of 14-0.

"(Oct 10, 2011  7:13 PM CDT) America's obsession with terrorism after 9/11 has left our borders prone to the tiniest of invaders, an AP study finds. Focused on guns and bombs, inspectors have overlooked foreign insects and plant diseases that menace the country's food supply, send prices soaring, and leave pesticide residue on food. Among our worst attacks: 19 fruit fly infestations that prompted spraying and quarantines in California, and a New Zealand moth that survived 1,600 pounds of pesticides.  Whether they know it or not, every person in the country is affected by this,  says one entomologist; one study puts the total annual cost at $120 billion.

NBC News gives an example: When it comes to delivering babies, midwives use less drugs and perform fewer episiotomies than doctors, and the mother/child death-rate was no different among the two groups. Further, patients were often reported higher satisfaction with midwives. The findings come from a review of 53 studies conducted over the last two decades that focused on the quality of care, and  debunk the myth that more extensive use of mid-level health workers might lead to services of poorer quality,  the bulletin reads, per Science Codex.  The quality of care they provide is comparable to physicians.  To boot, these mid-level health workers are cheaper, take less time to train, and are more willing to work in rural areas.

"(Oct 1, 2015  10:15 AM CDT) A law that provides medical monitoring and treatment for Sept. 11 first responders expired at midnight Wednesday due to the failure of Congress to act. For now, first responders who rushed to the World Trade Center after the 2001 terrorist attacks, worked for weeks, and now suffer from illnesses like pulmonary disease and cancers will still be able to get their health care. But in a letter to the Senate, CDC Director Tom Frieden said if the law isn't extended, the WTC Health Program  will begin to face significant operational challenges  by February. By next summer, the program's 72,000 enrolled beneficiaries will have to be notified that they may not receive health care beyond September 2016 and the program will have to start to shut down, a process Frieden says could cause patients additional stress. The Zadroga Act, named for a responder who died after working at Ground Zero, first became law in 2010 after a debate over the cost. Proponents seek the law's permanent extension in part because some illnesses may not manifest until years later, after the statute of limitations for worker's comp or certain state laws may have run out. House Republicans have been supportive of the program but oppose its permanent extension because they want to be able to periodically review it and make sure it's operating soundly; the Senate hasn't moved a bill.

He claims that certain  measures  have pushed back Tehran's timetable a few years, reports AP. He didn't say what those measures were exactly, but Iran is pretty sure Israel is behind the Stuxnet worm and an attack on two of its scientists.

"(Aug 16, 2013  4:45 PM CDT) Drinking several cups of joe a day may cut your risk of suicide, but it might just kill you anyway. A new study has linked heavy coffee drinking—that's 28 cups a week, or four per day—with a higher death risk in those under 55. Women who guzzled the brew were twice as likely to die, while the male risk jumped 56%, USA Today reports. Over 55? Drink three or less cups a day? You're safe to sip away, researchers say. The study also found heavy coffee drinkers were more likely to smoke and had less healthy hearts and lungs. The study analyzed nearly 45,000 people, aged 20 to 87, and found 2,500 had died after 17 years, though coffee's precise role isn't clear.  The exact mechanism between coffee and mortality still needs clarification,  a co-author told the Guardian, though the habit may be associated with a poor diet or sleeping late. But  dietary factors, marital status and other socioeconomic factors that were not adjusted for in this study may account for some or all of these observations,  a doctor said. Until more research can be done,  avoid excessive coffee drinking,  says the study's lead author.",4 Coffees a Day May Mean Early Death
"(May 6, 2018  6:11 AM CDT) As John McCain debated his choice for vice presidential running mate in 2008, advisers warned him against the optics of picking Joe Lieberman, a pro-choice Independent senator who caucused on the other side of the aisle.  It was sound advice that I could reason for myself,  he writes.  But my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.  The senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee, battered by brain cancer, is, as the New York Times puts it,  reckoning with his history and the future  via a final book and memoir. He calls passing on Lieberman, who also ran as a Democratic vice presidential candidate,  another mistake I made.  McCain's sentiment was news to Lieberman, who found out while watching the documentary.  It touched me greatly,  he said. There is a steady stream of friends and colleagues making their way to McCain's ranch in Sedona, Ariz., among them longtime former senator Joe Biden, whose own son, Beau Biden, died of the same kind of tumor that McCain has.  Here John knows he’s in a very, very, very precarious situation, and yet he’s still concerned about the state of the country,  says Biden. Biden, said to be mulling a 2020 presidential run, said McCain urged him to  not walk away  from politics. Both men fiercely oppose President Trump, and the Times reports that VP Mike Pence is to attend McCain's funeral in the president's place.

Researchers at a high-level biosecurity lab failed to follow protocol to  inactivate  the anthrax before transferring it to other labs. The good news is that none of the workers have shown any symptoms since the lapse was discovered last week, and the  risk of infection is very low,  says a spokesman quoted at NBC News.

"(Jun 30, 2015  8:50 AM CDT) A young Swedish woman who sued her former Wall Street executive boss over lurid allegations of sexual conquest, betrayal, and stalking was awarded $18 million by a federal jury yesterday. Hanna Bouveng, 25, accused Benjamin Wey in an $850 million lawsuit of using his power as owner of New York Global Group to coerce her into four sexual encounters before firing her after discovering she had a boyfriend. The jury in federal court in Manhattan awarded her $2 million in compensatory damages, plus $16 million in punitive damages on sexual harassment, retaliation, and defamation claims; it rejected a claim of assault and battery. Bouveng, who was raised in Vetlanda, Sweden, testified that soon after Wey hired her, the CEO began a relentless quest to have sex with her. She says he fired her six months later after she refused any more sexual contact and he found a man in her bed in the apartment he helped finance. Wey, 43, also sought to defame Bouveng by posting articles on his blog accusing her of being a  street walker,  a  loose woman,  and an extortionist, her lawyers say. For his part, the married Wey denied ever having sex with Bouveng. He portrayed her as an opportunist who bragged that her grandfather was the billionaire founder of an aluminum company when Wey first met her in the Hamptons in July 2013. Wey testified that Bouveng knew nothing about finance before he hired and began mentoring her. He claimed she betrayed his generosity by embracing a party-girl lifestyle that left her too exhausted to succeed.",Woman Wins $18M From Wall Street Boss in Sex Case

Other findings in the WHO study: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death in people ages 15-29; 75% of suicides take place in lower-income countries; and people over 70 are the most likely to die this way.  Suicide kills more than conflicts, wars, and natural catastrophes,  says WHO's mental health director in Yahoo News. Calling this often-stigmatized death a  major public health problem,  WHO says its goal is to cut the suicide rate by 10% by 2020. Some of the challenges in combating suicide are sensationalized media reports when a celebrity dies this way and people who are afraid to seek help for an issue that's  been shrouded in taboo for too long,  according to WHO's director general. One WHO scientist says countries can simply start  at [the] local level  with small-scale programs, including services for at-risk people who have already attempted suicide. Others say more education is needed, including in schools.

Brent Brisben, captain of the salvage ship that found the sunken treasure, tells CBS News the timing was  magical  and  surreal.  A lot more people might call it lucky.

Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will next hold preliminary talks in Washington on Tuesday, to be followed by up to nine months of negotiations on a peace deal. The Cabinet voted 13-7 with two abstentions to approve in principle the release of 104 prisoners, said a government official. The vote came after a stormy session in which PM Benjamin Netanyahu linked the release to a resumption of talks even as relatives of Israelis killed in Palestinian attacks protested outside.  I believe this is a step toward peace and I hope that we can use this opportunity to resume negotiations,  said Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. Under the deal brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry, the prisoners would be released in four stages over several months. Each release would be linked to progress in negotiations. The prisoners to be freed have served between 19 and 30 years for involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis; their fate is emotionally charged for both sides.

The Charlie’s Angels star, 62, was a 1970s fashion idol who began her career in commercials and shot to fame after posing in an iconic portrait wearing a red swimsuit. Longtime companion Ryan O’Neal was at her bedside; their 24-year-old son, Redmond O’Neal, was not. Fawcett’s single season as an Angel was followed by work in theater and films such as Logan’s Run. She also received Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for several TV movies. She starred in her own reality TV show, Chasing Farrah, and a TV special this year, Farrah’s Story, and was an advocate for the Cancer Society and against domestic violence.

Jacinto Bernardo asked a buddy to keep an eye on the fixer-upper he bought in Suisun City, Calif., back in January as he shipped out for his last deployment before retirement. When Bernardo and his wife got back to the US from Japan, they discovered that Jeremy Epperson had done much more than watch the house, reports ABC News. He raised $70,000 in donations as part of a new group he's calling Homecoming Heroes, then used the money to renovate the home from top to bottom.  Twenty one years in the Marine Corps, retiring, you don't deserve to come back to a house where you have to spend a lot of your savings and time fixing it up,  Epperson explains.

"(Jan 5, 2015  8:22 AM) Passengers flying from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates landed Saturday evening in San Francisco—but only after a grueling 28 hours on the plane, only 16 of which were spent in flight. They sat on the Abu Dhabi tarmac stranded by dense fog, unable to deplane, for 12 hours, Quartz reports. During that period, they received wrong information about when the flight would leave, the AP reports.  They kept telling us that we were going to leave, you know, 15 minutes from now, 20 minutes from now … for 12 hours,  says one passenger, per ABC7. The fliers were barred from exiting because, the crew reportedly said, there were too many other people being held at the airport amid what Etihad Airways called  unprecedented fog.   The delay was then compounded by the requirement to replace the aircraft's ultra-long haul operating crew, who had exceeded their flight time limitations,  the airline notes.  Everybody was fighting with each other, and the flight attendants were fighting with us, and we were fighting with the flight attendants,  says another passenger. The group was eventually given food, but only after some complained, the AP notes. Tweeted one passenger:  I feel like I'm in a Seinfeld episode,  Reuters reports.

"(Mar 17, 2017  8:58 AM CDT) Know anyone so fond of picnics they'd want to take up residence in a building shaped like a picnic basket? With $700,000, they might get the opportunity. After nine months on the real estate market, the  Big Basket  office building in Newark, Ohio, seems destined for a foreclosure auction with no one biting at its $5 million asking price, reports Bloomberg. Built in 1997 to look like one of Longaberger's baskets, the building housed the company for almost two decades before employees cleared out last year. Officials in Licking County, Ohio, are now anxious to take control in an effort to gain $700,000 in unpaid property taxes and other fees, some of which are tied to the work done on the roads around the basket, reports Consumerist.  The property has been referred to the Licking County Prosecutor’s office, and title work has been obtained,  says a county treasurer. A prosecutor adds a complaint for foreclosure is likely to be filed within  the next few weeks.  But it could be several months before an auction is possible as the case is complicated by a lawsuit between Longaberger's former owner and JRJR Networks, which took control of the company in 2013. JRJR Networks claims it was not aware at that time of what it alleges were tax liabilities reaching into the millions, reports the Columbus Dispatch; local officials say no property tax payment has been made since November 2014. Until an auction takes place, though, some locals are holding out hope that someone will turn the building into a community center or museum.

"(Nov 14, 2011  11:51 AM) REM’s break-up, announced in September, wasn’t a snap decision. The band had been talking about it during its 2008 tour, Michael Stipe tells Salon in a lengthy sit-down.  The decision came about quite organically, like most things in REM,  he says. By the end of that tour—which became their last— we all kind of knew that these were most likely going to be our last shows. It was already, for us, bittersweet and weird and hard.  He says the thought of not performing live again is  actually painful to think about,  but the band didn’t want to leave things open-ended because the members needed  closure  in order to move forward with new projects. Why not do a farewell tour?  The idea of doing some kind of victory lap … just felt—and still feels—like it would have been completely mercenary and exploitative and impossible,  Stipe says. Not to mention emotional for the band:  I could not perform ‘Everybody Hurts’ for the last time in London with 30,000 people in the room or 80,000 people on the field knowing full well it was the last time we were going to do it. I just couldn’t. I would collapse.  The entire interview—in which Stipe also muses over why Collapse Into Now is the perfect final album, and discusses the upcoming career-spanning collection—is worth a read.",Stipe: REM Breakup 3 Years in the Making

"(Sep 27, 2015  5:00 PM CDT) A decapitated skull discovered in Brazil is providing clues to the long-lost beliefs of people who lived there thousands of years ago, the Smithsonian reports. Found in 2007 and revealed in a new study, the 9,000-year-old skull seems to have been cut off and buried under limestone slabs—which may make it the oldest decapitated skull given a ritualistic burial in the western hemisphere.  This ritualized decapitation attests to the early sophistication of mortuary rituals among hunter-gatherers in the Americas,  lead researcher Andre Strauss tells CNN. How so? Well, vertebrae found with the skull bear ritualistic V-shaped markings, and two severed hands were positioned over the face with one set of fingers pointing up and the other pointing down, the Washington Post reports. Plus the skull appears to be from a local man, not an outside warrior whose head served as a trophy, notes LiveScience. (That makes it unlike the many trophy skulls and examples of skull worship discovered in the Andes mountains going back up to 3,000 years.) Interestingly, this skull also differs from remains at the same archaeological site, called Lapa do Santo in central Brazil, where bodies of the same era have been found mutilated, burned, and defleshed with their teeth pulled out before burial, Popular Science reports. So what does it signify?  In the apparent absence of wealth goods or elaborated architecture  at the time, Strauss writes,  Lapa do Santo’s inhabitants seemed to use the human body to express their cosmological principles regarding death.

"(Oct 18, 2014  3:36 PM CDT) Six different people were involved in a complicated plot to take ownership of a dead woman's home and car, police say. It started with one Romanoff Quarles, 43, of Philadelphia; he had his eye on the property of his neighbor Dorothy Kennedy, who had died with no heirs in 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Kennedy's home and car were legally supposed to go to the state, but Quarles' lawyer, Andrew Kaufman, 56, came up with  a scheme that would allow Quarles to unlawfully exploit the system,  police say. The plot reportedly went like this: Quarles would try to become the estate's administrator by pretending he'd supported Kennedy. That involved noting fake errands he'd run for her on old calendars. Meanwhile, Quarles buried Kennedy, with help from a former funeral home owner as well as chapel owner Antoine Turay. Turay provided Quarles with a bill for $7,000, though the burial had actually cost $1,400; that bill served as documentation as Quarles sought to become the estate's administrator. A real estate broker set up a false sale of Kennedy's home to Quarles, who obtained it in 2012, and an auto businessman helped give Quarles the car title.

"(Mar 28, 2017  11:30 AM CDT) Monday saw the start of UN talks focused on a noble goal: banning nuclear weapons across our planet. It was the result of a 2016 vote that saw more than 100 countries in favor of a UN General Assembly resolution to kick off such talks, which are aimed at ultimately establishing an international treaty that would prohibit the development and possession of such weapons, CNN reports. By extension, using them would also be banned. The AP reports Austria, Brazil, and Ireland were at the forefront of the effort. Wondering where the US is? Boycotting. US Ambassador Nikki Haley was present Monday—but remained outside the General Assembly hall with other boycotting nations in a sign of opposition. One big quote:  As a mom, as a daughter, there is nothing I want more for my family than a world with no nuclear weapons. But we have to be realistic.  Her view is that the nearly 50-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is doing its job, with the US slashing its nuclear arsenal by 85% under it, and that North Korea is too big a loose cannon for this to be a responsible or feasible endeavor.  North Korea would be the one cheering, and all of us and the people we represent would be the ones at risk,  she said.

Twenty-eight schoolgirls from Banja Luka went to the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital to sightsee and museum-hop; shortly after the girls got back home, it was discovered that seven of them (said to be ages 13 and 14) were with child.

Parental  neglect  is partly responsible for what happened to the girls, Babici tells InSerbia, as well as inadequate sex ed in the schools.

"(Dec 29, 2012  3:43 PM) Heartbreaking medical news: Cases of babies born addicted to pain pills are up more than 300% over the past decade, forcing doctors and nurses to invent treatments on the fly, the Wall Street Journal reports. Crying non-stop, vomiting, jerking their limbs, these newborns are the result of America's addiction to drugs called opioids—including anti-addiction drugs like methadone and painkillers like oxycodone. More than 13,000 such babies were diagnosed in the US in 2009. Ill-prepared hospitals have created different treatments, with one giving babies methodone and another trying morphine. But then newborns have to be weaned off of those drugs. Worse, care for drug-addicted babies can take weeks and fatten hospital bills; one study found a mean cost of $53,400, with Medicaid covering 78% of the cases. And hospital staffs worry about babies they fail to diagnose:  Some are going home and withdrawing,  said one doctor who noted that drug-addicted mothers may not be ready for such difficult, sensitive babies.",Newborns Addicted to Pain Pills Up 300%

(Just 3.5 hours after the explosion, the plume was tracked 684 miles east, traveling at 190mph, reports the Washington Post.

"(Jul 16, 2020  5:42 PM CDT) Max Nikias, who was president of the University of Southern California during what the US Department of Education called the school's  complete failure to protect students,  left his job with nearly $7.7 million in total compensation. Nikias left his post in August 2018, after a scandal involving a school gynecologist, in which he and other administrators were accused of not acting on abuse complaints over decades against Dr. George Tyndall. A USA Today analysis shows Nikias, who had lived on campus in the president's house, received a $3 million, no-interest housing loan as part of his deal when he stepped down. His take averaged more than $2 million over the previous four years. Nikias' final check, USC said,  reflects money owed to him for salary, retirement and other benefits, some of which date back to the employment agreement he entered into when he became President in 2010.  The university's Board of Regents said it went along with the package for Nikias  to accelerate his departure.  Nikias, who had no direct involvement in the scandal, is still a USC faculty member, per USA Today. The school made changes in its Title IX processes after the federal investigation, which was released in February.  This total and complete failure to protect students is heartbreaking and inexcusable,  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement at the time.",USC President Left With $7.7M After Medical Scandal
"(Mar 7, 2016  7:07 AM) A ring said to have belonged to Joan of Arc is back in the medieval peasant-turned-warrior's native France nearly 600 years after she was burned at the stake. The ring, which had been in England since the 15th century, sold at auction for more than $400,000 (about 30 times its estimated worth), the Telegraph reports. Purchased by the Puy du Fou foundation, which runs a historical theme park in western France, the ring arrived home on Friday, the BBC reports. The foundation's president praised the  glorious return  of a  French treasure.  Inscribed with  IHS  and  MAR  (for Jesus and Mary), the silver gilt devotional ring was made in about 1400. It will be officially unveiled this month, according to reports. Joan of Arc herself describes the ring in transcripts from the trial that ultimately led to her 1431 execution in Normandy (then ruled by the English) on charges of being a heretic and sorcerer. It is believed that she gave the ring to England's Cardinal Henry Beaufort the day before she was killed at age 19. Centuries later, a man bought the ring in a 1947 auction for about $250. He passed it on to his son, Robert Hasson of Essex, who discovered the ring's value after taking it to be appraised by Timeline Auctions. Committed to turning back an English invasion of France, Joan of Arc led forces into battle and advised French royalty. A devout Catholic, who claimed to receive divine guidance, she was canonized as a saint in 1920.",Joan of Arc's Ring Back in France After 600 Years

Some 7,600 employees are slated to get bonuses, in some cases totaling as much as $1.5 million, in a program that has drawn sharp criticism in Washington. Federal Housing Finance Agency director James Lockhart told Charles Grassley about the payments in a letter made available to the Journal. Barney Frank has called on Lockhart to end the payouts, saying he was  very skeptical  about rewarding the failed GSEs' staffs. But Lockhart defended the bonuses, $51 million of which have already been paid.  It is not realistic to expect that experienced and highly skilled employees will indefinitely continue to work as hard as they have if we do not provide reasonable incentives,  he wrote.","Fannie, Freddie to Pay $210M in Bonuses"
"(Dec 8, 2017  4:36 PM) A former aide says Rep. Trent Franks offered her $5 million to act as a surrogate for he and his wife, the AP reports. And according to Politico, sources say female staffers were unclear if the Arizona Republican was suggesting in vitro fertilization or actual intercourse when he made the pitch. Franks announced his resignation Thursday ahead of a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual harassment, admitting to speaking to two female staffers about surrogacy. Now new details are leaking out. A former staffer says Franks asked her about being a surrogate at least four times, making her uncomfortable.  I was asked a few times to look over a 'contract' to carry his child, and if I would conceive his child, I would be given $5 million,  she tells the AP. She says she felt retaliated against after refusing. Meanwhile, sources say the two female staffers asked about surrogacy by Franks were unclear if he was suggesting sex as part of the deal. A former staffer says in another instance Franks tried to convince a female aide that she was in love with him by giving her an article about how you know you're in love with someone. Andrea Lafferty, president of the Traditional Values Coalition, says she reported allegations against Franks to House Speaker Paul Ryan in recent weeks, calling his behavior  horrific — a powerful man hiring young women, procuring staff, to potentially surrogate children for him.  Ryan then asked Franks to resign. While Franks had said he would leave office in January, he now says he will resign Friday after his wife was hospitalized Thursday night  due to an ongoing ailment,  CNN reports.",Ex-Aide: Rep.

"(Dec 3, 2014  6:49 AM) Bobby Keys, who played saxophone for the Rolling Stones—as well as the likes of John Lennon and Buddy Holly—has died at 70, the Telegraph reports. The Texan may be best known for his solo on the Stones' hit  Brown Sugar.  He began playing with the band in the 1960s, played on every album until 1974, and continued with the band on stage for decades. Health issues forced him to cancel recent dates.  I have lost the largest pal in the world, and I can't express the sense of sadness I feel, although Bobby would tell me to cheer up,  says Keith Richards, who wrote the foreword to Keys' memoir. Together, the two lived a wild, drug-fueled lifestyle; they were known for throwing a TV out a hotel window in 1972, the New York Times reports, calling Keys a  a hard-living, semi-law-abiding participant in the late-night, sex-booze-and-drug-flavored world of musical celebrity.  Keys was inspired when, at age 12, he saw Buddy Holly play. He wanted to play guitar afterward, but it was too expensive, so he ended up with a saxophone provided by his school.  The only instrument they had left, the absolute last instrument available, was an old baritone saxophone, which I had no idea how to even put my lips on,  Keys wrote in his memoir. He first saw the Rolling Stones play in 1964 and began playing with them five years later; last year, he appeared on stage with them at the UK's Glastonbury festival.",Rolling Stones' Sax Player Dead at 70
"(Dec 27, 2017  3:00 PM) Authorities in Leonia, New Jersey, are so tired of out-of-town drivers clogging their streets during rush hour that they're taking what even the police chief acknowledges is  extreme  action: They're outlawing out-of-town drivers at crunch time. Soon, anyone not from Leonia caught driving there between 6 and 10am and 4 and 9pm will face a $200 fine, reports the Star-Ledger. Cops would be able to quickly figure that out because residents are being issued yellow tags to hang on their rear-view mirrors.  It's an extreme initiative, I'll be the first to admit that,  says Police Chief Thomas Rowe.  However the traffic that we deal with is completely extreme.  The problem is that Jersey drivers cut through the small borough to get to the George Washington Bridge. And as the New York Times notes, the chief sees traffic apps as the  game changer  in the congestion mess.  In the morning, if I sign onto my Waze account, I find there are 250,000 ‘Wazers’ in the area,  Rowe says.  When the primary roads become congested, it directs vehicles into Leonia and pushes them onto secondary and tertiary roads.  On some days, residents can't even get out of their own driveways, he says. Town officials insist the move is legal, but a representative from the National Motorists Association says otherwise and predicts the driving ban might be upended in the courts.

Boomers have 19 years to redeem themselves.  His suggestion: Cash.  We should pass on to the next generation an America that’s free from debt,  writes Kinsley.  Instead of ignoring it, or arguing endlessly about whose fault it is and who should pay for it, Boomers as an age cohort should just grab the check and say, 'This one’s on us.'  One way to start is with an improved estate tax, one  that reaches far more people—essentially anyone who inherits any significant amount of money—but at a much lower rate.

"(Sep 15, 2017  6:36 PM CDT) Harry Dean Stanton died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles at the age of 91, TMZ reports. The longtime character actor was memorable in roles in Pretty in Pink, Alien, Escape from New York, Godfather II, The Green Mile, Big Love, Repo Man, Cool Hand Luke, Twin Peaks, Wild at Heart, and countless others. In fact, the Hollywood Reporter, which calls Stanton the  quintessential American actor,  argues he was memorable in pretty much every role he took. Stanton, born in 1926 in Virginia, served in the Navy during WWII and fought in the Battle of Okinawa. He got his first TV role in 1954 and jumped into movies in 1957, Variety reports. His acting career would span six decades. He was also an accomplished musician, performing regularly with The Harry Dean Stanton Band. The actor known for his  gaunt, bedraggled look  didn't get his big break and first leading role until the age of 52 in 1984's Paris, Texas.  After all these years, I finally got the part I wanted to play,  THR quotes Stanton as saying of that film.  If I never did another film after Paris, Texas, I’d be happy.  Ultimately, Stanton decided it was  too much work  to be a leading man.  He has this pride in appearing to not have to work hard to be good,  says Sophie Huber, who directed a 2012 documentary about Stanton. The actor was friends with Bob Dylan, Hunter S. Thompson (at whose funeral he sang), Marlon Brando, and Jack Nicholson (at whose wedding he served as best man and with whom he lived post-divorce). Stanton died of natural causes. He was a  lifelong bachelor  but has said he has  one or two children.  His final film, Lucky, will be released Sept. 29.",Actor Harry Dean Stanton Dies After 6-Decade Career

Of the 300 or so children vaccinated between May 2-5 in Nacholdokopele village in Eastern Equatoria state, another 32 were sickened with symptoms including fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, but recovered, Reuters reports.

Specialists found that the children were afflicted with severe sepsis toxicity as a result of the contaminated vaccine. Per Sky News, children as young as 12 administered the vaccines, and officials are working to discover who should be held responsible. Per the Independent, the World Health Organization provides some training on administering vaccines to South Sudan's health officials, and UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency, provides the vaccines to the government. But it was unclear whether UN officials were present for the Nacholdokopele vaccinations, and a joint statement from the two agencies says the people administering the vaccines were not qualified or trained.

A few days later, per Reuters, 500-euro notes, which  had probably been cut with scissors,  were found clogging toilets at three nearby restaurants, Vincent Derouand of the prosecutor's office tells AFP, via the Local.
