"(Oct 19, 2015  2:44 PM CDT) For the third time in less than a month, a Muslim man has been killed over beef. In the most recent incident, an 18-year-old truck driver was burned in the cab of his truck in an Indian-controlled part of Kashmir Oct. 9 because he was suspected of transporting beef; he died of his injuries Sunday. The teen was actually carrying coal, the Los Angeles Times reports. Hindu militants are suspected in the gasoline bomb attack—Hindus consider cows sacred for religious reasons, while Muslims eat beef. Two thousand demonstrators flooded the streets in Kashmir Monday to protest the attack, and violent clashes broke out between them and security forces. A curfew has been instituted. The first recent murder took place late last month when a Muslim man in India's Uttar Pradesh state was lynched by a mob over rumors (apparently untrue) that he'd eaten beef. Then, last week, a Muslim man was killed by members of a radical Hindu group because he had allegedly smuggled cattle from another Indian state. Also today, Hindu militants threw ink on a Muslim lawmaker who recently served beef at a party he hosted. They reportedly shouted,  India will not tolerate any disrespect to cows.  Nine people have been arrested in connection to the latest death, the AP reports.",3rd Muslim Man Killed Over Beef,____rd Muslim Man Killed Over Beef,3,Trans( third ),1
"(Mar 27, 2016  12:33 PM CDT) Jim Harrison, the fiction writer, poet, outdoorsman, and reveler who wrote with gruff affection for the country's landscape and rural life and enjoyed mainstream success with his historical saga Legends of the Fall, has died at 78. A rep for Harrison's publisher told the AP that Harrison died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Ariz. The cause of death was unknown. Harrison's wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last fall. The versatile author completed more than 30 books, most recently the novella collection The Ancient Minstrel, and was admired worldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of his interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin near his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood script writer who was close with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles, and Warren Beatty. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary appetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of tales. Published in 1979, Legends of the Fall was a collection of three novellas that featured the title story about Montana rancher Col. William Ludlow and his three sons, the narrative extending from before World War I to the mid-20th century, from San Francisco to Singapore.  Late in October 1914 three brothers rode from Choteau, Montana to Calgary, Alberta to enlist in the Great War,  reads Harrison's celebrated opening sentence. The book was a best-seller, and Harrison worked on the script for an Oscar-nominated 1994 film. But he would liken the nerve wracking process to being trapped in a  shuddering elevator  and reminded himself of his marginal status by taping a putdown by a Hollywood exec,  You're just a writer,  on a piece of paper above his desk.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has thrown his support behind Marine Corps veteran Pete Kiernan's plan, offering up to $5 million, which will be donated to 10 veterans' charities if Trump releases his income tax returns, CNET reports. Hoffman says he will pledge five times what Kiernan raises at Crowdpac.com, with a $5 million ceiling. Kiernan, 26, served in Afghanistan and has  the moral authority to challenge Trump to demonstrate his own commitment to the core American values of transparency and accountability,  Hoffman writes in a post at Medium.com, accusing Trump of holding back his tax returns as a  bargaining chip.  By releasing the returns before the final debate on Oct. 19, Trump can  help voters make more informed decisions on Election Day and support many worthy veterans' organizations at the same time,  he writes.

Police say the four gunmen fled on motorcycles and have not been apprehended. The attack was a reminder of the risks faced by educators and aid workers, especially women, in an area where Islamic militants often target women and girls trying to get an education. Many militants in the region oppose female education and have blown up schools and killed female educators as a way to discourage girls from getting an education.

"(Sep 3, 2016  2:35 PM CDT) The WHO is changing up its policy for battling gonorrhea for the first time in more than a decade as antibiotic-resistant strains continue to spread worldwide. The organization now recommends that doctors give up using the class of antibiotics known as quinolones and instead prescribe another class called cephalosporins, reports NPR. The move comes as quinolones become less and less effective in treating gonorrhea, but the WHO change is no long-term fix. One widely used cephalosporin is called ceftriaxone, and already 46 countries have reported strains of gonorrhea that are less susceptible to ceftriaxone than previously, reports Science. If ceftriaxone stops working entirely, the WHO says doctors should try a combination of older drugs called gentamicin and spectinomycin, but gonorrhea is expected to develop resistance to those drugs rather quickly.  We will have to have new drugs in five years, I think,  a WHO researcher says. Gonorrhea infects an estimated 78 million people each year, though infections have climbed 53% from 2012 to 2015 in the UK, where researchers are testing whether oral cases of gonorrhea can be treated with only mouthwash, per the BBC. A recent study suggested that mouthwash decreased the amount of gonorrhea bacteria in male patients’ throats.

The last word will go to the principal of Liberty High School in Hillsboro, who agreed to issue a letter of apology as part of a settlement in the case. Addison Barnes sued the school, Principal Greg Timmons, and the Hillsboro School District, accusing them of violating his First Amendment rights. KOIN reports that Barnes initially covered up the  Donald J. Trump Border Wall Construction Co.'' he wore to school in January, but then decided to reverse course. He was then told to cover it again or go home, and he chose the latter option, which the school recorded as a suspension. The Oregonian reports a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order two months ago that prevented the school from banning the shirt for the remainder of the school year, with the judge saying the censorship wasn't legally justified. The school had argued the shirt could fuel a  hostile learning environment.  The settlement, announced Tuesday, will also see the district pay $25,000 to cover Barnes' legal fees. Willamette Week has a statement from Barnes, who has since graduated from the school:  Everyone knows that if a student wears an anti-Trump shirt to school, the teachers won't think twice about it.

The dog, a Cane Corso that neighbors say was trained to attack, belongs to the mother's live-in boyfriend, according to investigators.

"(Feb 23, 2016  9:19 AM) Since 1989, Salman Rushdie has had to live a mostly underground life after Iran's then-supreme leader called for his assassination over the novel The Satanic Verses. Now that fatwa, which is occasionally paraded out by the country's religious leaders, has been reupped yet again, and this time 40 state-controlled media groups are crowdfunding it, the Guardian reports. The organizations raised about $600,000 at a media trade fair to add to the existing bounty, which is now said to run close to $4 million, per the New York Times.  Imam Khomeini's fatwa is a religious decree and it will never lose its power or fade out,  Iran's deputy culture minister tells the Fars News Agency, which shows a picture of Rushdie, 68, with crosshairs on his forehead. The 27-year fatwa against Rushdie—who once said living in hiding was like a  comedy routine — was supposedly lifted in 1998 by ex-President Mohammad Khatami, but the religious faction said only the issuer could pull it back (and Khomeini died in 1989). After current supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took the country's reins, he decreed the fatwa was still in place. Meanwhile, an Iranian journalist tells the Times she believes the latest reminder about Rushdie, who's lived a discreet, bodyguard-flanked lifestyle in New York City for more than a decade, is meant to be a distraction as elections near.

(Multiple reports don't make it clear exactly what they were trying to do.) The teen put the minivan into reverse, then accidentally pushed the gas pedal instead of the brake, police say. Cho was approaching the driver's side door when that happened; the minivan hit her, and she was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital in a suburb of Chicago. Now, her husband Paul Sang Cho—the boy's grandfather—is suing the teen over the crash, CBS Chicago reports. The male Cho has filed a wrongful death lawsuit, alleging that his grandson was negligent and careless when he failed to keep the minivan under control, failed to give warning of what he was doing, and failed to yield the right of way. He's suing for an unspecified amount of money.

A commando team stormed the apartment in the southern German city of Karlsruhe, but the 53-year-old gunman and the victims were already dead. Also killed was the girlfriend, a 55-year-old woman who was found on her bed with a gunshot wound to her chest, near the gunman's body. The bailiff and new owner were found with their hands bound on a couch, dead from gunshot wounds to the head. A locksmith was found dead on the floor. The woman had fallen behind on payments and the apartment was sold at foreclosure auction. At about 8am the bailiff, a locksmith, and a social worker showed up to evict her. When nobody opened the door they began trying to force the lock, then the suspect opened the door and ushered them in, said a deputy police chief. The new owner of the apartment, a 49-year-old man, showed up minutes later. Once all were inside the suspect told them to sit but when the bailiff refused, the suspect went into another room, grabbed a pistol, and shot him twice in the thigh before shooting the locksmith in the head.

She dished on what her husband did right after they got back from their honeymoon: bought 100 cans of Campbell's Chunky soup.  I never bought 100 of anything,  she told moderator Anderson Cooper.  This was shocking to me, so we had a tough conversation about it. I said,  You don't buy 100 of anything, much less canned soup. We can't do this.  Heidi said that while Ted was sleeping, she brought all 100 cans back to the store, but after a panicked phone call to her mother  just to make sure I'd done the right thing as a newlywed,  she realized the soup should stay. As the New York Daily News notes, that wasn't the only odd revelation about Cruz that emerged during the town hall. The man who once fought against masturbation also relayed how he'd once watched porn with Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. And in what may be one of the more scandalous tidbits to arise in Election 2016, Cruz's daughter, Caroline, who just turned 8, revealed she's got tape of her dad dolled up in granny panties and a pink feather boa at a father-daughter picnic.

It all started around 2am when,  apparently, there was an argument over Santa's girlfriend—Mrs. Claus,  one officer explains.  One of the victims ran back to his car, and the guy dressed as Santa Claus must've thought he was going to get a gun because he started shooting.  Both 29-year-old victims are expected to recover; the 26-year-old suspect was chased for several blocks by two off-duty officers who happened to be nearby.

That's what Timothy Morrow, 43, found out this week, the Chicago Tribune reports. Morrow has not only been convicted eight times—with the first coming at age 17—he's been cited nine more times for driving while intoxicated, and twice for boating under the influence, said prosecutor Ben Dillon, who dramatically referred to Morrow as the  grim reaper to every driver on the road.  Morrow has had two previous stints in jail, once in 1995 for DUI, and once in 1996 for driving without a license.  It defies logic,  Dillon said.  It is clear this defendant just doesn't get it and doesn't care.  Morrow pleaded for leniency, telling the court he was abused as a child and that the police hadn't listened when he reported it.

At the same time, nearly 5 million homes and businesses in a dozen states were still without electricity, and utilities warned it might be a week or more before some people got their power back. In many cases, the moment of maximum danger arrived well after the storm had passed, as rainwater made its way into rivers and streams and turned them into torrents. Irene dumped up to 11 inches of rain on Vermont and more than 13 inches in parts of New York.  We were expecting heavy rains,  says one resident of Upstate New York.  We were expecting flooding. We weren't expecting devastation. It looks like somebody set a bomb off.

Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther had spent the weekend at her Salisbury home with her daughter, Lauren Lusk, preparing for the birth, reports NBC News. Lusk says she left the house Tuesday morning to gas up before the two departed for the hospital in Charlotte, some 40 miles away. Lusk returned  about 7 or 8 minutes  later to find her pregnant mom was gone, as was Lusk's 2001 Mazda MPV van and Bradshaw-Crowther's wallet and phone.  The lights in the house were off, the door was unlocked,  says 26-year-old Lusk, who describes her mom as nervous but happy. Now six days have passed, and the Salisbury Post confirms by way of police she's still missing. Police say Bradshaw-Crowther was spotted Wednesday at a gas station in Statesville, roughly 25 miles away, CBS News reports; the surveillance footage showed her in a blue raincoat, and police say she was also seen at a nearby hotel. Meanwhile, Bradshaw-Crowther's health may be at stake:  She cannot give natural birth, and that's why our family is so worried,  Lusk says.  If she does go into labor, she won't make it.

That was the experience on a Southwest Airlines flight from Atlanta to Houston last week, NBC News reports, when retired Air Force Col. Tom McCay fell unconscious as he and his wife were flying home to Texas. McCay tells KPRC2 he began feeling  clammy  and  dizzy  during the flight, and the last thing he remembers before passing out was his frightened wife, Maggie, asking if he was OK. She started yelling for assistance, and Texas oral surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Aycock was one of the first to respond—followed by about 20 other doctors. Aycock and a few of the doctors stretched McCay across the seats so he could breathe better and so they could take his vitals and stabilize him. The other 15 or so doctors, meanwhile, hovered close by, ready to assist if needed. It wasn't just some weird coincidence that placed all of these medical professionals on board McCay's plane: They were returning from an annual conference in Atlanta. While Aycock thinks McCay may have fainted because he didn't have enough fluids during the flight, another doctor who helped speculates McCay may have mixed meds and alcohol. McCay tells NBC he got checked out at DeBakey Clinic in Houston once he arrived home and will be self-monitoring. It turns out what happened to him has long been a dream: He'd always harbored a  fantasy  of rushing to help a pilot in distress.  Turns out it was me this time,  he tells NBC.

The third-place finisher had to settle for two live hand grenades. The prizes were handed out at an awards ceremony in a town near Mogadishu, where Sheik Muktar Robow Abu Monsur—a moderate figure, as al-Shabab sheiks go—proclaimed that  Children should use one hand for education and the other for a gun to defend Islam.

"(Jun 18, 2012  3:13 AM CDT) Religious clashes have left dozens of people dead in a state that straddles Nigeria's Muslim north and Christian south. At least 21 people were killed when militants bombed three churches in Kaduna provinces yesterday. A suicide bomber was behind one attack while another was the work of militants throwing bombs into a church from outside, the Guardian reports. Those attackers were caught and killed by a mob and Christian reprisals against Muslims are believed to have killed at least seven more people. After the attacks, Christian youths dragged Muslims out of their vehicles and killed them in retaliation, according to witnesses who spoke of seeing many bodies at a roadblock. Christians have been patient,  but retaliation is the only solution for now because the government fails to address the insurgency caused by the terrorists,  one Pentecostal Christian tells the Christian Science Monitor. The radical Boko Haram sect has claimed responsibility for the church bombings.","Nigeria Church Bombings Kill 21, Spark Reprisals","Nigeria Church Bombings Kill ____, Spark Reprisals",21,Copy( 21 ),0

Davis, who was 91, renounced his nationality and all others in 1948 and was arrested many times in the following years as he tried to travel the world with a  World Passport  he had devised, the New York Times reports. As  World Citizen No. 1,  he founded the World Government of World Citizens, which has issued more than half a million World Passports and claims 150 countries have recognized them at one time or another.

The SpaceX CEO can now breathe a little easier, after what Time calls a  near-perfect flight  ended with the capsule landing safely Friday morning in the Atlantic Ocean, about 200 miles off the coast of Florida. (Watch the capsule, attached to four parachutes, touch down in the water here.) The flight from the International Space Station took about six hours, the AP reports. Per NPR, NASA says we haven't seen such an Atlantic  splashdown  of a craft designed for humans in nearly a half-century, when Apollo 9 came back to Earth on March 13, 1969. The Verge reports there was one especially notable achievement for SpaceX during this test flight: The unmanned Crew Dragon managed to dock itself to an exterior ISS port, a move the company had never done before, and one that's needed if SpaceX eventually ferries people to the space station. There was one  witness  on board the capsule: a  smart  test dummy named Ripley, which was built to measure how the human body would be affected. This was the first test flight for the Crew Dragon, which will be retrieved from the ocean by a SpaceX recovery vessel.

Sarah Henderson, 29, has been charged with capital murder in the deaths of her two daughters, 7-year-old Kaylee and 5-year-old Kenlie, who were shot in the head early Thursday in Maban, south of Dallas, the Washington Post reports. Police say husband Jacob Henderson called 911 at 11:30pm Wednesday to say his wife was  freaking out.  He called minutes later to cancel the emergency call, but called again at around 2:30am Thursday with disturbing news.

According to KPTV, Anna sent a Snapchat message to her father Jon Schmidt, a member of the band The Piano Guys, last Sunday saying she was hiking the Tooth Rock Trailhead area in the Columbia River Gorge. It seems that was the last anyone heard from Anna.  Monday I didn't see any posts or snaps or anything like that, which is really unusual because she posts everyday,  Michelle says. Anna also didn't return texts, failed to pick her mom up at the airport, and hadn't been seen by her roommate. Anna was reported missing Wednesday, and police found her car near the trailhead.

Yale has acquired the 304-page memoir, titled The Life and Adventures of a Haunted Convict, and shed some light on its origins, reports the New York Times.

He spent a stretch from the 1830s to the 1850s in prison in nearby Auburn.

Sources tell Politico that the NJ governor is in the final stages of preparation and plans to finally confirm the long-rumored bid with an announcement next week. Christie has been making speeches across the country in recent weeks and has dropped major hints at a bid, including saying his family is finally on board, Politico notes. But while supporters say there's still plenty of room for a GOP establishment-friendly candidate, Christie has been on the scene too long to be seen as a fresh face or a rising star—especially in light of the long-running bridge closure saga. Christie's biggest problem may be his lack of popularity even in New Jersey, where a poll released yesterday put his popularity rating at 30%, down around 40 points from its peak in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.  The good news is that none of his potential presidential opponents have emerged with a decisive lead yet,  pollster Krista Jenkins at Fairleigh Dickinson University tells the Inquirer.  The bad news is that he is the governor in a state where a sizable majority give a thumbs down to his leadership.

There were 144,145 new cases among children 17 and under from Nov. 12 to 19— by far the highest weekly increase since the pandemic began,  the American Academy of Pediatrics said Monday. That total marks a 28% increase over the previous week ending Nov. 12, which saw 112,000 new COVID-19 cases among children and also broke records, per Smithsonian. Almost 1.2 million US children had tested positive as of Nov. 19, representing 11.8%  of all cases in states reporting cases by age,  said the AAP, which analyzed data from 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Hospitalizations and death among children remain uncommon. Still, the AAP is pressing health authorities to include children in vaccine trials.  If we do not add children to these research trials very soon, there will be a significant delay in when children are able to access potentially life-saving vaccines. This is unconscionable,  AAP President Sally Goza says in a release.  Children are not little adults,  adds Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases.

For months there were texts, Snapchat, and Instagram—she was told she was a loser, she had no friends. She was even told, ‘Why don't you kill yourself,'  the lawyer for the Grossmans says, per NBC News. But school administrators  ignored months of pleas  from her family to do something, the lawyer says, despite the fact that after the harassment started in October, Mallory started getting chronic headaches and stomachaches and her grades went down. Grossman's mother says the family spoke to teachers, guidance counselors, the vice principal, and the principal, and that while she was told the school was investigating, she felt her concerns were dismissed. When nothing changed, she even approached the parent of one of the alleged bullies (the family has identified three or four students, though not publicly, and their lawyer says they are considering taking action against their families as well).

Earlier this month, Debra McKenna received a sweet reminder of the man she'd loved, from the most unexpected place. The Bangor Daily News relays how this story started, in 1973, when the two were still students at Maine's Morse High School and newly dating. Before Shawn headed off to college that fall, he gave McKenna his class ring—which she soon lost. She recalls that she'd gone to use the bathroom at a Portland department store, taken the ring off while washing her hands, and left the bathroom without remembering to put the ring back on.  I left my name and number [at the store] but never got contacted by anybody, and that was it,  she says.  I never saw [the ring] again.  Enter Marko Saarinen, who recently stumbled across the ring while using his metal detector in a forest—in Kaarina, Finland, 47 years after McKenna had lost it. Saarinen contacted the Morse High School alumni group, and because Shawn was the only person in the class of 1973 with the initials  SM,  which were engraved on the ring, it was easy to determine it was his. To add another layer of weird, Saarinen is a shipbuilder, and  Shipbuilders  is the Morse High School mascot. McKenna, who tells the Daily News she still feels  adrift  since her husband's death, wonders if this is a sign from him.  He's telling me to get my act together.

In the wake of that backlash, the company announced this week it will install a third, single-person restroom to the few hundred US stores that don't already have one by March 2017.

He rejects the argument that there wasn’t enough collateral to go the AIG route, and that there was no viable buyer for Lehman—proposing that poor handling by Paulson soured the Barclay’s and other possible deals. He also reviews the charge that AIG was bailed out to save Goldman, Paulson’s alma mater. Goldman, he calculates, was sufficiently hedged to survive an AIG collapse.

Weinstein's previous legal trouble involved alleged assaults on two women, and Monday's charges add a third woman. Prosecutors say Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent in 2006. If convicted of the latest offense, he faces a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life in prison.  Mr. Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated,  said defense attorney Ben Brafman outside court, per the AP.

"(Nov 12, 2019  11:43 AM) Southwest Airlines couldn't produce safety data for 38 jets, which caused the Federal Aviation Administration to consider—but ultimately delay—grounding those jets, the Wall Street Journal reveals. The airline brought 88 used foreign jets into its fleet between 2013 and 2017, and last year an FAA official uncovered abnormalities with the paperwork. Southwest has since informed the FAA that for some of the planes, it has struggled to find reliable paperwork indicating that necessary repairs and maintenance were carried out by previous operators, but that Southwest considers it  more of a record-keeping problem than a safety risk,  per the Journal. Ultimately the FAA allowed the planes to continue flying as long as Southwest sped up inspections and finished them by the end of January. CNN notes the issue was brought to light after a Senate panel released paperwork Monday. Of the 88 jets in question, 41 have been inspected and deemed compliant and nine are undergoing inspections. A veteran maintenance inspector first expressed concern about the remaining 38 planes last year, and more inspectors continued to complain to FAA managers this year that paperwork was missing. By Oct. 29, the FAA was threatening to ground the planes, all of which are Boeing 737s. Discussions between the FAA and Southwest then ensued, and the Jan. 31 deadline was agreed upon. Southwest tells the Journal none of the discrepancies in question would make flights unsafe.  A small number of repairs on a few aircraft had been performed but not properly classified by the previous owners because of differences in language and repair criteria,  a spokesperson says.

"(Apr 5, 2018  8:32 AM CDT) Salman Khan's life might get significantly less glamorous. The world's ninth-highest-paid actor, who has appeared in more than 100 Bollywood films, was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday in India after being found guilty of poaching, though his lawyers intend to appeal and a bail hearing is slated for tomorrow. Khan was initially convicted of killing two blackbucks, a protected species of antelope, in 2006, some eight years after prosecutors said he shot the animals from a car while in Jodhpur to film 1998's Hum Saath Saath Hain, reports the Guardian. The car's registration number was reportedly seen by a member of the Bishnoi tribe, which views the antelope as sacred. But Khan's conviction was later suspended, per the BBC. He was then acquitted before charges were laid again. Khan was taken to jail following Thursday's verdict; four other actors in the car were acquitted for lack of evidence. The prosecution  engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence and documents as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case,  Khan's lawyer, HM Saraswat, tells Gulf News.  It even failed to prove that the black bucks were killed by gunshots.  His lawyers said Khan had only an air gun that couldn't have taken down an antelope, per CNN; Khan has suggested the animals died from overeating. Khan has other legal troubles to worry about: His 2015 acquittal in the 2002 hit-and-run death of a homeless man is being challenged in the Supreme Court, per the Guardian.

The AP describes  a maze of trading between meat wholesalers,  making the origins of the meat difficult to trace.

About 500 Syrians, Palestinians, Egyptians, and Sudanese are feared dead after their boat was rammed and sunk off the Malta coast last week, the International Organization for Migration, an inter-governmental organization with 156 member countries, said yesterday. Another 200 are feared dead in the wreck of a second boat that was carrying at least 250 African migrants to Europe when it capsized off the Libyan coast. That would raise the total number of migrants killed on the sea in 2014 to about 2,900, according to estimates from the IOM and other officials. The migrants apparently lost off Malta were undertaking a perilous journey from the Egyptian port of Damietta, seeking a better life in Europe, when their boat was overtaken by human traffickers on Wednesday, said IOM spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume. According to IOM's interviews with two survivors from that group, the traffickers rammed the boat carrying the migrants with one of their two vessels.

Indeed, the South held a lottery to select 100 participants in August, and two are now dead. One potential sticking point, however, is planned US-South Korean military exercises. Pyongyang says the exercises are aimed at a future invasion of the North and wants them canceled, but the South intends to hold them later this month.

"(May 31, 2020  9:03 AM CDT) Rio Tinto has apologized to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people after setting off explosives last week that destroyed two ancient rock shelters in Western Australia. The sacred Aboriginal site, in the Juukan Gorge in the north of the territory, dates back 46,000 years, SBS News reports.  We are sorry for the distress we have caused,  the mining giant's chief executive said in a statement. The company was in the process of expanding an iron ore mine.  As a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area,  the CEO said. The Australian government has announced it will begin a review of heritage protection laws, per the Sydney Morning Herald. A UNESCO official has compared the destruction to that of sites in Afghanistan and Syria by the Taliban and ISIS. The company indicated that, in years of negotiations, Aboriginal representatives hadn't relayed the importance of preserving the site, a suggestion that was rejected.  The high significance of the site was further relayed to Rio Tinto,  a spokesman said,  as recently as March.  He said Rio Tinto didn't disclose its intention to blast and had said last fall that it had no plans to expand the mine. Archaeological digs at the site have uncovered grinding stones, a bone sharpened into a tool and 4,000-year-old braided hair. It's Australia's only inland site where evidence has been found of continuous human residency through the last Ice Age. The discoveries were made after the mining project received approval in 2013.

"(Sep 23, 2017  9:12 AM CDT) A small earthquake shook North Korea early Saturday, according to South Korean officials, raising fears that the country had carried out another nuclear test amid its escalating dispute with the US. The quake happened near where North Korea has carried out other nuclear tests, which have registered as small earthquakes, though opinions are split on the source of the latest quake, the Guardian reports.  A key method is to look at the seismic waves or seismic acoustic waves and the latter can be detected in the case of a man-made earthquake,  a South Korean meteorological official says.  In this case we saw none. So as of now, we are categorizing this as a natural earthquake.  China's official Xinhua news agency, however, says an explosion was the likely source of the quake, which China measured at 3.4 magnitude, the AP reports. The US Geological Survey says it measured the quake at 3.5 and it cannot confirm whether it was natural or not. China also announced Saturday that it is limiting petroleum exports to North Korea under the terms of a UN resolution passed after a nuclear test earlier this month, reports USA Today. At a rally in Alabama Friday night, President Trump mocked Kim Jong Un as  Little Rocket Man  and told supporters they had nothing to fear from North Korea, despite the country's threat to detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific, reports the Washington Post.",US: Magnitude 3.5 Quake Detected in N.

"(Jun 24, 2019  11:39 AM CDT) India's Supreme Court on Monday directed state and national authorities to file reports to the court on an encephalitis outbreak in the eastern state of Bihar this month in which 152 children have died. A senior Bihar health department official, Sanjay Kumar, said the epidemic is showing signs of slowing, with no new deaths on Monday. The fatalities have occurred in 20 of the state's 38 districts, the AP reports. More than 700 cases of encephalitis have been registered since the outbreak began June 1, officials said. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the illness, which can cause swelling of the brain, fever, and vomiting. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heat wave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 114.5 Fahrenheit.  We're hoping with the onset of the monsoon, the epidemic will ease further,  Kumar said. The Supreme Court was responding to a petition filed by a lawyer.  The deaths of children are a direct result of negligence and inaction  on the part of authorities, per the petitioner. The court expressed concern over the deaths and asked the governments to respond within seven days with details on medical facilities, nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene conditions in the state. Thousands of Indians suffer from encephalitis, malaria, typhoid, and other mosquito-borne diseases each year during the summer monsoon season. India's central government has sent medical experts to Bihar to help doctors treat the patients. The Bihar authorities have been sharply criticized because patients were sharing beds in crowded hospital wards with too few doctors.

The Interior Ministry claims that more than 57% of Syria's 14 million eligible voters turned out, with about 9% voting no and 1.6% of the ballots being rejected as spoiled.

Authorities arrested the 68-year-old in Portugal yesterday after 41 years on the lam. Even the bare bones of his rap sheet nearly defy belief, as CNN and AP recount: In 1962, he murdered a gas station owner (a highly decorated WWII vet) during a robbery; he escaped from prison in 1970 (reportedly by stealing the warden's car), then went underground with the Black Liberation Army. In 1972, while dressed as a priest, he and others hijacked a plane to Algiers (after making FBI agents dress in bathing suits to deliver ransom money). Algeria returned the plane and money but allowed the hijackers to disappear, which they did with help from Black Panther activist Eldridge Cleaver, who was living in the country. Wright remained on the loose for four decades until a dogged New Jersey corrections officer got a lead (possibly because Wright contacted relatives in the US) that resulted in his arrest. Wright is fighting extradition back to the US.

But engineer Augustine Charahani found the peace of mind to curl up on a flight of stairs and wait over 40 hours in the hope rescuers would find him, the New York Times reports. His ordeal began Sept. 20 in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, where the overcrowded ferry capsized about 160 feet from its destination, Ukara Island. Seems a sudden turn by the pilot or a rush of passengers when disembarking caused the boat to flip. About 40 managed to swim ashore and 228 drowned, per Tanzania's Daily News, which left Charahani alone with the floor above his head and ceiling underwater.  Their screams were so loud,  he recalls of the disaster.  I think they struggled and drowned almost immediately.  Then came the silence and the dark. He screamed for help, rapped his keys on the wall—thought he heard a knock in return once, but no one came—and dared fall asleep with his head nestled on a life jacket.  Anytime I slept, there was a good chance of me sliding and falling back into the water,  he remembers. Charahani says he saw Jesus while asleep and his four children while awake: Who will take care of them? Why had he taken such a dangerous job? Will death take me? Feeling faint and hungry, with the room about two-thirds flooded and air dissipating, Charahani felt a diver grab his ankle.

Such gun violence hasn't been seen in Chicago since July 5, 2003, when 10 homicides occurred, reports the Chicago Tribune. Police say the various shootings were unconnected (though two 30-something men did die in one shooting). Among the dead are two 19-year-olds; a woman in her 20s; a 25-year-old man shot in the head, chest, and groin; and a 60-year-old man, NBC Chicago reports.  It's unfortunate to have this many murders in one day,  says an officer.  Is this the worst it has been? No. We've got to put it into perspective.  Police say one of the nine gunshot deaths wasn't a homicide but was accidental: 11-year-old Antwone J. Price was shot by a family member who was fooling around with a gun. His father and grandfather previously died in shootings, his family says. Over 36 hours from Tuesday afternoon to early Thursday, the death toll reached 12.

What scientists still don't exactly know is why (an asteroid? volcanic eruptions?), but they now know how long it took. And the answer is ... really, really fast. MIT researchers say the extinction period's duration clocked in at 60,000 years, plus or minus 48,000 years. As Phys.org puts it, that's  practically instantaneous, from a geological perspective.  To get your geological periods and catastrophic disasters straight: The die-off signified the end of the Permian period and launched the start of the Triassic; the mass die-off of the dinosaurs happened much later, 66 million years ago at the Cretaceous period's close, when LiveScience reports 85% of life was wiped out. The researchers came to their conclusion by using cutting-edge dating techniques on tiny minerals known as zircons found in rocks in Meishan, China, that date to the period. But the rocks also held carbon dioxide data; from there, the researchers determined that a surge of the gas occurred 10,000 to 20,000 years before the die-off: Ocean acidification may have have occurred, and sea temps could have jumped as much as 50 degrees. But what was the source of the increased carbon dioxide that marked the beginning of the end?

Seems the children were unrestrained in the back seat while the adults were wearing seatbelts. The cause is unknown, but NBC Washington notes that roads were icy statewide when the crash occurred northbound on Route 301 in Bowie, Md., just before 5am. Kashmere Cooper, who knew Taylor back in middle school and high school, says she began crying when she heard about the crash.  I am still heartbroken,  says the District Heights resident.

That's when, for most of the world, the coldest year in the future will be hotter than any in recorded history, according to a new study published in Nature. It's sort of an odd concept, but scientists from the University of Hawaii at Manoa wanted to help people relate to climate change data on a day-to-day level, the New York Times reports.  Go back in your life to think about the hottest, most traumatic event you have experienced,  said lead author Camilo Mora.  What we’re saying is that very soon, that event is going to become the norm.  The study also found that if we curb greenhouse gas emissions, that will delay the turning point by 20 to 25 years, giving us all vital time to adapt.

The settlement to be paid to Valerie Castile will avoid a federal wrongful death lawsuit stemming from Castile's death, per the AP. The 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was killed by St. Anthony officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop July 6 after Castile told the officer he was armed. Castile had a permit for his gun. The shooting gained widespread attention after Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with her then-4-year-old daughter, livestreamed the gruesome aftermath on Facebook. Yanez, who is Latino, was acquitted of manslaughter and other charges earlier this month. The jury's decision prompted days of protests, including one in St. Paul that shut down Interstate 94 for hours and ended with 18 arrests. The $2.995 million settlement will be paid by the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust, which holds the insurance policy for the city of St. Anthony.

In a statement cited by NBC News, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says a report came in around 3:30pm on Tuesday of a man shooting a handgun in the air outside the town of Davenport. That same person is believed to have carjacked a vehicle, and when police finally caught up with him, they say he wasn't exactly amenable to accommodating a traffic stop.  The suspect continued driving South towards the city of Santa Cruz ... refusing to pull over,  the sheriff's office statement says, noting the driver reached speeds upward of 100mph. Once the suspect entered the city, cops stopped the chase so as not to endanger community members. They say they caught up with the suspect again, however, which is when the driver ended up  going over the cliff and into the water —with the driver subsequently clambering out of the submerged vehicle and back up the cliff, where police were waiting to arrest him. No injuries have yet been reported.

Sanford explains that times are tough, and one of the options legislators are considering—raising taxes—isn't being well received.  Rather than have the government come after your hard-earned money, you can now send an amount that fits your budget, even request where your money be used,  he writes on GoFundMe. As of this writing, 38 people, including residents of Iran and Canada, had given a total of $598. The only problem: Alabama's budget shortfall, and therefore the GoFundMe target, is $300 million.

"(Dec 10, 2014  5:15 AM) A pair of retired Air Force psychologists who had never interrogated anybody before were paid a fortune to devise the CIA's  enhanced interrogation  program, according to yesterday's Senate Intelligence Committee report. The psychologists—identified in earlier reports as Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen—helped develop interrogation techniques for the CIA starting in 2002 and conducted many waterboardings themselves. They set up their own firm in 2005, and the Senate report says the CIA outsourced  virtually all aspects  of the program to it, paying the contractors $81 million before their $180 million contract was terminated in 2009, the Telegraph reports. The Senate report says neither man had specialized knowledge of al-Qaeda,  a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise.  Mitchell and Jessen—who accused agents who failed to use waterboarding and other  enhanced  techniques of running a  sissified  interrogation program—had experience not in real interrogations, but in running a Cold War-era training program on what captured airmen could expect from Communist interrogators, reports the New York Times. To devise their techniques, they drew on the  learned helplessness  theory concept developed by psychologist Martin Seligman. Seligman, considered a top expert on human happiness, tells New York that he is  grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.

The 2,700-acre property near Santa Barbara, Calif., has been renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch. The listed price represents a significant cut from the $100 million it was on the market for last year. In addition to a 12,000-square-foot main residence and a 3,700-square-foot pool house, the listing boasts a separate building with a 50-seat movie theater and a dance studio. Other features on the ranch are a  Disney-style  train station, a fire house, and a barn. Jackson sold the ranch to Colony Capital prior to his 2009 death for $22.5 million.

"(Mar 2, 2016  6:48 AM) Some cancer drugs are barely wasted at all. Teva Pharmaceuticals' Treanda, used to treat leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, comes in four separate dosage packages, so only 1% of the drug is typically thrown away. But with 18 of the top 20 cancer drugs sold in only one or two vial sizes, roughly 10% of the cancer drugs hospitals and doctors buy go to waste, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center report this week in the journal BMJ. This means that Medicare, private health insurers, and cancer patients alike spend nearly $3 billion every year buying drugs that nurses and doctors throw away because of what Marketplace calls  bad packaging —where a single vial can hold sometimes more than twice as much drug as a patient has been prescribed.  Drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it,  co-author Dr. Peter Bach tells the New York Times.  If we’re ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut.  The problem isn't limited to cancer drugs either, with, as one example, Johnson & Johnson's Remicade for arthritis generating $500 million a year in waste. But the study focused on cancer drugs and found that in more tightly-regulated European countries drugs must be sold in differently-sized vials. Co-author Dr. Leonard Saltz first noticed the waste when he realized the drug Keytruda was only sold in 50-milligram vials.  I thought that was really cynical—and then it got worse,  he says. Last year Merck moved to 100-milligram vials only; it still sells 50-milligram vials in Europe.

No matter how you slice it, for a company that is perceived as growing so rapidly, to slow so much … will be somewhat concerning to investors.  Net income fell 12%, to $205 million, down from $233 million a year earlier, in part because the company has roughly doubled its spending in the past year.

"(Nov 11, 2015  9:12 AM) A woman could face 10 years in prison after twerking on a man without his consent at a gas station in DC, reports the Houston Chronicle. The unidentified victim says the abuse started when two women flashed him while he was pumping gas on Oct. 7. While in the checkout line, police say Ayanna Marie Knight, 22, of Las Vegas, began rubbing her buttocks against the man. He tells NBC Washington he tried to back away from Knight, but the abuse continued, as seen in a surveillance video released Monday. A second woman, who police have not been able to identify, then  grabbed (the victim's) groin and buttocks multiple times in a very aggressive manner,  authorities say. When the man told the gas station clerks to call police, he says they  just sat there,  leaving him feeling  humiliated.   When someone is just grabbing your body parts without your permission, no matter who it is, that's just a violation completely,  the man says. He tells Fox 5 DC that he thought his assailants were prostitutes and  men dressed like women,  and feared men outside the gas station were their pimps. They could've had  guns to come and shoot me,  he says. He says he left the checkout area but one woman grabbed his arm to keep him from leaving. He eventually called police from the gas station's car wash. Though jokes about the incident are rampant on social media, a rep for DC group Collective Action for Safe Spaces says the incident  is a prime example of the public sexual harassment and assault that people across our city experience on a near-daily basis.

Former Westminster police officer Curtis Arganbright faces up to 10 years in prison on a new charge of violating the woman's civil rights, the US Attorney's Office for Colorado said Monday. The 36-year-old woman had been caught stealing medical supplies from the emergency room of Westminster's St. Anthony Hospital, where she'd arrived to be treated for chronic alcohol abuse in August 2017. However, hospital staff said they wouldn't press charges if a police officer made sure the woman got home safely, reports the Washington Post. On the ensuing ride, Arganbright pulled over, ordered the woman to pull down her pants, put her in handcuffs, and forced her to perform sex acts, according to court documents. He also allegedly warned the woman,  Better not tell anyone about this,  per KDVR. Investigators later found DNA evidence on the victim and Arganbright's patrol car, reports the Denver Channel. But Arganbright, originally charged with sexual assault, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of unlawful sexual contact with a woman and official misconduct and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and four years probation, per the Denver Post.

Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift.  Van Halen was 65. He founded the band Van Halen with drumming brother Alex Van Halen, singer David Lee Roth, and bassist Michael Anthony in Pasadena, Calif. in 1974, and his incredible guitar skills helped make them one of the most successful hard rock bands in history, the Guardian reports.

A moon dust collection bag that Carlson bought for just $995 in an online government auction in 2015 sold for $1.8 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York Thursday, the BBC reports. The bag, marked  Lunar Sample Bag,  was used by Neil Armstrong to collect moon dust during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 and still contains small rocks and traces of lunar dust, the AP reports.

It was among items that the FBI seized from the home of Max Ary, the former director of a Kansas space museum, in 2003. NASA tried to get the bag back when it realized it had been misidentified and sold, but a federal judge ruled in Carlson's favor. She plans to use some of the proceeds to set up a scholarship at Northern Michigan University.

Dr. Mario Molina, a US citizen born in Mexico, passed away Wednesday at the age of 77 at his Mexico City home, the Washington Post reports. When Dr. Molina first started studying CFCs—industrial chemicals used in coolants for air conditioners and refrigerators, deodorant sprays, and other aerosols—it wasn't believed they caused any harm to the environment. Along with UC Irvine professor F. Sherwood Rowland, however, Molina discovered that CFCs actually did pose a significant danger, by depleting the ozone layer. That discovery led to the scientists winning the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen. Now, the world says goodbye to the man called  one of the single most important contributors to climate protection in world history  by former White House climate adviser Paul Bledsoe, per Science. Molina's environmental nonprofit says he died of  unexpected cardiac problems,  Reuters reports. Molina's work jump-started international efforts to curb CFCs, including 1987's Montreal Protocol, which imposed regulations on man-made chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. Environmental attorney Durwood Zaelke says Molina always remained a  gentleman,  even when the chemicals industry  vilified  him for his work against CFCs.

Passengers told their stories to the AP: One man whose flight from Fort Lauderdale was rerouted says he sat there from 1:30pm to 9pm; snacks and bottled water ran out, and  the toilets were backed up.

One man on an American Airlines flight from France says passengers heard a range of reasons for the delay, from the need to refuel to the airport's limited capacity for handling international flights. A traveler from Boston had a similar experience.  We were told we were the third plane in line to get to the gate when we landed,  he said.  Then we stayed on the plane for seven hours.  JetBlue confirmed that thanks to a  confluence of events,  such as equipment failures that prevented planes from landing in low visibility at New York-area airports, some of its planes were diverted to Bradley International Airport, where power outages reportedly made deplaning tricky.

In the first of a three-part series titled  Homes for the Taking,  the Washington Post investigates the evolution of a long-running DC lien program. Under it, a lien is slapped on a property belonging to a homeowner who hasn't paid taxes; investors essentially help the city  collect  by buying these liens at auction and charging interest. But where those investors were once of the  mom-and-pop  variety, they're now  well-financed, out-of-town companies  who charge interest for six months and can then foreclose on the property after that mark if the debt hasn't been paid; they can also slap on thousands in legal fees. The Post has found 509 such instances of foreclosure (about 200 homes, the rest commercial real estate, parking lots, and land) since 2005; in Bennie Coleman's case, his $134 bill grew into a $4,999 debt. And many of the victims are  vulnerable : Coleman is battling dementia; a 95-year-old woman in a nursing home with Alzheimer's lost her home over a $44.79 debt.

The only thing that sets her apart from most other parents across America: She hasn't paid a cent in rent or mortgage payments. And the 1,490-square-foot house wasn't a gift or inheritance—it's just that no landlord or city tax official ever showed up to make her pay up or get out, the Indianapolis Star reports.  [It's] kind of a bizarre case,  says the director of housing for a local legal clinic, who explains that after the mortgage crisis hit Indianapolis in 2004,  there were so many bad loans out there that ownership really got kind of confusing. ... There are still a lot of properties that are kind of in limbo.  In 2005, Hardy's former employer, a property management group, offered her the chance to live rent-free in the house for as long as she worked for the company. But the company went out of business the following year, and Hardy appeared to fall through the mortgage and municipal cracks: She kept paying her utility bills, and when she called the city to ask what she should do about the delinquent property taxes, officials told her it wasn't her problem because she wasn't the owner. The city was aware of the home's status but was simply overwhelmed with an influx of tax-delinquent homes it had to dump.

The discovery was made last week at the site of the crash of the Tulsamerican, the last B-24 Liberator bomber built in Tulsa, Okla., near the end of World War II, according to Croatia's state TV.  The remains of human bones have been found, but we can't say anything without further analysis,  says Zadar University archaeologist Mate Parica. The wreckage itself was found at the bottom of the sea at a depth of some 130 feet near the island of Vis in 2010 after a 17-year search.

The crew apparently tried to get the plane back to its base in Italy, but they eventually decided to ditch it in the Adriatic. An effort to recover and return pieces of the wreckage to Oklahoma for display at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum has been underway for several years.

"(Mar 18, 2015  6:22 AM CDT) The first steps to justice have taken a glacial 20 years, but Serbia has made its first arrests in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 1,000 Muslim boys and men. Police arrested seven men in early morning raids across Serbia and one suspect is on the run, the chief Serbian war crimes prosecutor tells the AP.  They are former members of a special brigade of the Bosnian Serb police,  he says. Nedeljko Milidragovic, 58, a commander known as  Nedjo the Butcher,  was among those detained.  There are other suspects in Serbia and neighboring countries and we are after them as well,  a deputy prosecutor tells Reuters. Though Serbia has previously charged others with aiding the crime, he says the arrests mark  the first time that our prosecutor's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in Srebrenica.  After heavy shelling, Bosnian Serb forces led by Ratko Mladic—now on trial at The Hague—entered Srebrenica in 1995 and crammed 1,000 men and boys into a warehouse. They then fired several rounds into the building and heaved grenades through the windows. When 100 survivors remained, Milidragovic allegedly ordered them out of the building and promised they would be spared; they were murdered, too. Some 8,000 men and boys were killed over three days in a crime since ruled a genocide, the BBC reports.

"(Jul 8, 2015  11:50 AM CDT) Having one child with a rare muscular disease would buck the odds; having four kids affected by it is downright astonishing. That's the plight of 23-year-old Rivka, 22-year-old Tziporah, 18-year-old Tzvi, and 15-year-old Racheli Herzfeld, four siblings from Teaneck, NJ, who are fighting what Fox News calls a  mystery illness  that's weakening their muscles and progressively robbing them of their ability to walk, as well as plunging their family into at least $100,000 in debt. What makes it even more frightening is that doctors haven't pegged exactly what the disease is, notes the Record, despite many tests over the past decade.  It is a little bit concerning that we've done all this testing and still cannot really figure out what it is,  one of the geneticists who's worked with the family tells Fox. The Herzfelds' mom, Esther, says the kids  were all just … normal and fine, and seemingly healthy  when they were born and were active and played sports as they got older. But when Tziporah was 11, she started falling in gym class, and a neurologist initially diagnosed her with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited disorder. Her brother and sisters also eventually started exhibiting symptoms, but tests for CMT on all four came back negative. Students at the school where Esther teaches found out about their predicament and started crowdfunding to raise money for a customized van, home renovations, and medical bills for the Herzfelds; a local synagogue and others have also helped financially. In the meantime, despite their condition—the girls walk slowly and carefully because they can't get up if they fall, and Tzvi now uses a motorized wheelchair—the kids remain determined to find some answers.  A question mark isn't really doing it for me,  Rivka tells the Record, while Esther notes,  We believe in miracles because we don't have any options.

"(Nov 14, 2011  2:40 AM) The US government is so concerned about security preparations for the London Olympics that authorities plan to send 500 FBI agents and 500 other security personnel to protect American athletes and diplomats, reports the Guardian. US officials are worried about new legal restrictions on Britain's anti-terrorism  stop and search  powers, and are demanding specifics on security manpower assigned to athletes, sources have told the newspaper. The Olympic Committee, which organizes the event, initially thought some 10,000 security personnel, with some of those coming from the military, would be enough for the games. But after recent reconsideration, officials believe they may need closer to 21,000 guards for 32 Olympic sites across the country. British officials, meanwhile, are growing annoyed by the US' pestering and by the nation's probable large security  footprint  during the games.

"(May 9, 2017  5:52 PM CDT) Three teens featured in a 1961 Life magazine article thrust California surfing life into the spotlight, a seemingly carefree existence of surf, sand, and sun. But as Sheila Weller explores in Vanity Fair, there were darker undertones floating underneath the Malibu surfing scene, an  underground saga  that often masked the unhappy home lives of those who drifted toward it. At the center of her story—and the subjects of the Life photo spread—were Mike Nader, Duane King, and Larry Shaw, three 16-year-olds who came from broken homes filled with abuse, alcoholism, and neglect, seeking refuge and comfort in the warm Southern California waters and under the wing of legendary  surfing hedonist  Miki Dora. Weller explains how the charismatic Dora, whom Nader called  the Cary Grant of surfers,  enraptured the so-called  lost boys  with his equal parts masculinity and femininity. But under Miki's mystique was a small-town scammer who became angry when the movie Gidget put surfing on the map—sending crowds of newbies to the shore to ruin his paradise. The boys became part of Dora's  brazen, swashbuckling counter-narrative,  immersed not only in petty theft, but also in the heady world of girl surfers, who  materialized through the ocean glare like Valkyries rising from fjords.  Even Jim Morrison of the Doors showed up on the scene for a time. The landscape grew increasingly darker as the '60s progressed, replete with hard drugs and Dora himself eventually earning jail time for his dabblings in check and credit card fraud. To the lost boys, though, Dora would always be the one who offered them shelter from  the jaws of family pain  in a  Technicolor dream of wet and wild and rebellious adventure.

Dooley ran from a Dec. 27 car accident that severely injured owner Barbara Bagley and her husband and killed the couple's other dog. A search was organized, but called off Jan. 6—the same day Bagley's husband died from his injuries—when remains, thought to be Dooley's, were found near the interstate.

But the documents still don't answer the big question: Why did Stephen Paddock kill 58 people and wound more than 500 others from his Las Vegas hotel room window? According to CNN, the documents do give a peek at what investigators knew about the case and believed about Paddock's actions at the time the search warrants were filed. One conclusion, as per the New York Times:  Paddock planned the attack meticulously and took many methodical steps to avoid detection of his plot and to thwart the eventual law enforcement investigation that would follow.  The documents also include messages about buying and selling weapons sent between two email accounts that both appear to be controlled by Paddock.  Try an ar before u buy. We have huge selection.

"(Apr 25, 2018  11:00 AM CDT) It's bad enough to be detained for a crime you didn't commit; it's worse when that detention leads to nearly three weeks in the back of a van, deprived of a bathroom. The Washington Post reports a Virginia man is suing for just that, saying he was arrested in September 2016 in Winchester, Va., with a cop telling him the car he was driving had been reported stolen in Houston. He was then extradited to Texas in an 18-day trip in a private prison transport van. Edward Kovari's suit—filed against Brevard Extraditions, Prisoner Transportation Services of America, and its parent company, Prisoner Transportation Services—says he and the 15 or so others crammed in the van received small water rations and occasional fast food, that he was denied his hypertension meds, and that, due to no bathroom breaks, he spent much of the seven-state trip sitting in his own and others' waste. An editor for a prisoner legal publication tells the AP conditions like these are common in the private prison transport arena, as the goal is to pick up as many prisoners around the nation as possible for  cost efficiency.  (The Marshall Project has previously investigated this  deadly world,  including PTS' role.) When Kovari finally arrived in Houston, he couldn't walk and his blood pressure had spiked to above 200 (a systolic number above 130 is considered high).  The realization that this could happen to potentially anyone is frightening,  one of the attorneys for Kovari, now 39, tells the Post. The charges against Kovari were eventually dismissed.

"(Aug 2, 2014  7:41 AM CDT) Now we know why the execution of Joseph Wood in Arizona took so long: It took 15 doses of drugs to get the job done, reports the LA Times. State prison officials laid out the details yesterday, explaining that Wood got a combination of hydromorphone and midazolam at 1:52pm on July 23. Authorities waited a few minutes for him to die, and when he didn't, they gave him another dose. After a few minutes, they gave him another, and another. In all, it took 15 doses before Wood was pronounced dead nearly two hours later. The state defended its procedure, notes the Arizona Republic, saying that prisons chief Charles Ryan was in constant contact with the IV team and followed the correct protocol. Ryan promised an independent review. Wood, who murdered his girlfriend and her father in 1989, was supposed to get 50mg of each drug, but he ended up getting 750mg of each instead, reports the New York Times.  They're making this up as they go along,  says an anesthesiologist, who explains that because the drugs are made to treat patients, figuring out the precise dose necessary to kill someone is mostly guesswork.

Without proof, Totenberg could only hope he would one day see his  musical partner of 38 years  again.

Today, it falls back into the hands of the Totenberg family at a ceremony in New York, reports the violinist's daughter and NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg. She says the FBI called her in June to say the violin had surfaced in a locked case left to Johnson’s ex-wife when he died of cancer in 2011. Appraiser Phillip Injeian, contacted by Johnson's ex-wife, doubted the Stradivarius' authenticity since just 550 are known to exist.

"(Oct 4, 2016  5:35 PM CDT) At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache. Then came rapid shallow breathing, a tremor, double vision. Within days in August 2014, she was  a limp rag doll,  reports Today—but it took doctors some time to diagnose her with acute flaccid myelitis, a rare disease the CDC warns is becoming increasingly more common. Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared. Some had been diagnosed with the West Nile virus, and others with an enterovirus.  August to October is typically when enteroviruses circulate  and  we see more acute flaccid myelitis during that season,  a doctor tells NBC News.

The Detroit Free Press reports that nearly 80% of those have voluntarily left the country. The Homeland Security Investigations Detroit office told the newspaper Tuesday that about half of those remaining have received final orders of removal; others are appealing their removal, and one has been granted lawful permanent resident status. Ninety of the arrests were made in recent months, after the initial January sting. The Department of Homeland Security created the University of Farmington, which has offices in Farmington Hills, but no classes or teachers. Federal indictments say recruiters were paid to help foreigners maintain their status as  students  and get work permits. The newspaper reports that seven of eight recruiters charged by the government pleaded guilty and have been sentenced. The eighth person will be sentenced in January. The students arrived in the US legally, on student visas, and attorneys for them say the US government trapped them by listing the university as legitimate in various places.

"(Oct 20, 2015  3:00 AM CDT) Life of one kind or another has been around on this planet for 300 million years longer than thought, according to US researchers who took a close look at some incredibly ancient crystals unearthed in Australia. The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, Reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the Hadean, after Hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the New Scientist notes. The UCLA and Stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on Earth may have formed  almost instantaneously —and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point.  The early Earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that,  study co-author Mark Harrison says in a UCLA press release.  The planet was probably much more like it is today than previously thought.

"(Apr 27, 2016  12:33 AM CDT) Illicitly bought prescription drugs have killed more than a dozen people in California who were expecting something much weaker. A CDC report released Tuesday warns that hospitals in the Bay Area have recently treated at least seven patients who overdosed after taking what they thought was Norco, a medium-strength opioid painkiller. The pills actually contained fentanyl, a far more powerful drug that's 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the CDC. The Bay Area patients survived, but Sacramento County officials have reported 12 deaths linked to fake Norco in recent weeks, with another two fatal overdoses in neighboring Yolo County. Health officials obtained one of the fake pills from a Bay Area patient and discovered that it was an exact replica of a Norco pill, Medical Daily reports. Finding the source of the fakes  is our number one priority based out of San Francisco,  a DEA special agent in the city tells the AP.  We definitely want to connect the dots where we can.  The CDC report says fake medicine containing fentanyl is an  emerging and serious public health threat  and that it's vital for the general public to realize the  significant risks to life and health when purchasing what appears to be prescription medications from any source other than a reputable pharmacy or health care provider.

But officials are divided on what the delay means: Some Democrats think Republicans are stalling in hopes of overtaking the Senate and White House next fall, so they can nix the reforms altogether; but some Republicans counter, saying federal agencies aren't equipped to meet the deadlines.

Where was your sense of decency?  Cook County Circuit Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked them on Friday during their first court appearance, sounding baffled that the suspects could be charged with such cruelty toward the 18-year-old victim, the AP reports. The beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media.

Prosecutors offered new details of the assault in Friday's hearing, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the mother of the victim, who is schizophrenic and has attention-deficit disorder. A prosecutor told the judge that the suspects forced the victim to drink toilet water and then allegedly stuffed a sock into his mouth and taped it shut as they bound his hands with a belt. The four are charged with two counts of committing a hate crime—one because of the victim's race and the other because of his mental disabilities.

"(Feb 5, 2014  9:20 AM) After cats, what's the second biggest killer of birds? Windows. A new report finds that between 365 million and 988 million US birds, or as much as 10% of the country's bird population, die each year after flying into windows. And interestingly, skyscrapers account for less than 1% of those deaths, Science News reports. Buildings from four to 11 stories are biggest culprits, causing about 56% of the deaths, while one- to three-story buildings cause about 44% of the deaths. Per building, however, skyscrapers are deadliest, with each one doing in an average 24 birds per year, compared to just a few birds per smaller building. But that's because there are just 21,000 skyscrapers in the country—compared to 138 million smaller buildings. Why are windows so dangerous to birds? One reason: Birds on long migration flights can be disoriented and confused by artificial lights at night. You can turn your lights off in an effort to help them out, or try bird-thwarting products like hawk stickers on your windows, Gawker reports.

"(Nov 28, 2015  11:08 AM) Egyptian officials are now  approximately 90%  certain there's a hidden chamber inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun, AFP reports. And at least one archeologist believes he knows what it holds.  Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted,  Nicholas Reeves said at a news conference on Saturday.  I think it is Nefertiti, and all the evidence points in that direction.  The tomb of Queen Nefertiti has never definitively been found, and Reeves believes King Tut was actually buried in her tomb because his wasn't ready, with her being shunted off to a side room, according to the BBC. He came up with his theory while analyzing detailed scans of King Tut's tomb used to create a replica for tourists. He claims those scans revealed two doorways that were covered up. Infrared scans made earlier this month seemed to support Reeves' theory, showing differing heat patterns along the walls of the tomb, AFP reports. According to the BBC, Egypt's Antiquities ministry did further scans to test the theory over the past few weeks, leading to Saturday's  90%  estimate. The scans are being sent to Japan for further analysis. And while experts are now fairly convinced Reeves was right about the hidden chamber, the question of who—if anyone—is inside is still being debated. The AFP reports the next step for researchers is to figure out how to get through the hidden doorways without damaging King Tut's tomb.

Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, says the US was watching the site, called Raso Camp, for several weeks, the AP reports.

He says the US estimated that as many as 200 fighters had been at the camp, including a number of trainers. He adds that that there were no known civilian casualties.

Police tracked the vehicle to the overpass on Interstate 287 in Wanaque Township using the man's cellphone signal, but they found it empty, report ABC 7 and NJ.com. The man's body was then found beneath the overpass in a wooded area near the Wanaque River. His children, found conscious, were taken to a hospital with concussions, per WPIX. The youngest also suffered a bruised lung. A police officer says it's a  miracle  they survived at all, adding,  I was expecting the worst outcome when I arrived at the scene, and I was amazed last night and even this morning on the condition of the children.

"(Nov 10, 2012  11:30 AM) Nouri al-Maliki seems to have had a very expensive change of heart, at least for Russia. The Iraqi prime minister abruptly canceled a $4.2 billion arms deal agreed to last month that would have made Moscow the nation's No. 2 arms supplier behind the US, reports AFP. A Maliki spokesman says the prime minister got wind of  corruption  and kickbacks related to the deal, but AFP's Moscow source thinks the US pressured Baghdad into scrapping it. The BBC quotes the head of the Center for Analysis of World Arms Trade, and he agrees:  As soon as the deal was announced a month ago I said that the US would not allow Iraq to buy such huge quantities of weapons from Russia. I believe Washington regarded this as an absolutely unacceptable scenario,  he said, adding that Maliki's corruption allegations were a  smokescreen.

A deep crater has been found at the crash site in Augusta County, and it's not clear whether the pilot managed to eject in time, reports the AP.  It is probably 5, 6 miles from the crash site to the nearest civilization,  the commander of the 104th Fighter Wing says.  It's deeply wooded, and a lot of hills and mountains.  Helicopters are searching the area overnight, as are rescuers on foot and on horseback. The pilot  has all the training you need as far as survival in the woods and as far as ejection and as far as communications and such if you don't have a radio on you,  the commander tells WCVB.  He has been well-trained to survive.

Duterte promptly relieved members of the military and police he named from their current posts and ordered government security personnel to be withdrawn from politicians he identified in a nationally televised speech. He also ordered gun licenses of those named revoked.  All military and police who are attached to these people, I'm giving you 24 hours to report to your mother unit or I will whack you. I'll dismiss you from the service,  Duterte said, per the AP. He said that the list of politicians, judges, and law enforcers given to him by the military and police might or might not be true, but that he had a duty to disclose to the public how the drug problem had become so pervasive.  There is no due process in my mouth,  Duterte said.  You can't stop me and I'm not afraid even if you say that I can end up in jail.  The list, which Duterte said included some friends, has been validated by authorities but did not contain details of the officials' alleged involvement to the drug trade or offer any evidence.  It's a pandemic,  said Duterte. Duterte's war on drugs has already left more than 400 suspected dealers and pushers dead and more than 4,400 arrested in more than a month since he took office.

The Journal reports on FEMA's pre-Sandy announcement that it had 400 industrial-size generators at the ready, each able to help power large and vital buildings, like hospitals. But with millions still powerless,  only a fraction of that equipment  has been deployed. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate yesterday said that four generators were installed overnight—that's 1% of its stock, days after the storm hit. Fugate expected that number to climb to about 70 by yesterday's end, placed in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. But the Journal said his numbers didn't align with those provided by state officials. New York, for instance, said it had seven generators from FEMA up and running, six of which are providing power to the Long Island Railroad. Another 54 generators are to arrive today. But the slow progress isn't necessarily FEMA's fault. The Journal explains that there are a variety of generators, each type suited for specific needs. FEMA tells the states about the types available, and the states must then assess which generators it can use; that process takes time.","FEMA Promises 400 Generators, But Few Up and Running","FEMA Promises ____ Generators, But Few Up and Running",400,Copy( 400 ),0

Dozens of officers and firefighters turned out this month to pay their respects to Sultan, a 13-year-old German shepherd who sniffed out drugs and bad guys with the Yarmouth Police Department. Officers gave a last pat or scratch to the dog. Then they provided an escort for Sultan's final trip to a veterinary clinic. South Portland canine officer Shane Stephenson said today that he took Sultan into his home as a pet when the dog retired from police work at age 10. He said the dog was friendly and lovable to the point of letting Stephenson's baby boy tug on his tail and ears.  But when it came down to business, he was one of the best, too,  the officer said. Sultan was the first police dog with the Yarmouth Police Department; he was in great demand across southern Maine during his years with the department. He and former Yarmouth Officer Mike Vogel, who now works in Florida, answered more than 1,000 calls, capturing dozens of suspects and seizing untold amounts of cash and more than 100 pounds of narcotics. Vogel said Sultan was also popular with schoolchildren.  He was a gentle giant,  he said.  There's a lot of attachment with these police dogs. They're with us 24-7.

The 4-year-old was coaxed away from her home in Madhya Pradesh on April 17, and was found bleeding severely the next day by her parents. She had been in a coma and on a ventilator since then, with severe injuries to her brain and vagina. She died last night of cardiac arrest. Two men have been arrested in connection with the attack; police say one lured her by promising to buy her bananas from an area shop. Some are angry at what they see as an imbalanced reaction:  The value of life for a little girl whether in Delhi or Madhya Pradesh is the same,  says a lawyer from the area.  So why are people not coming on to the streets when this girl has died?

A local police spokeswoman tells the AP that police responded to a call around 10am local time and went to a house in Tribistovo, where several people were found dead.

He tells the Wall Street Journal that he thinks the group's chances of reaching a deal in time are  less than 50-50, but you have a lot of very good people on that board.  He says he doubts he will accept anything less than the $5.7 billion he is seeking for a border wall, because  I have to do it right.  Trump, who announced a deal Friday to reopen the government, says another shutdown is  certainly an option.  He has also threatened to get the wall built by declaring an emergency. Trump says he doubts he will approve any deal involving citizenship for  Dreamers,  because he feels it is a  separate subject to be taken up at a separate time.  Asked about conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who called Trump a  wimp  for reopening the government without a deal on the wall, Trump says:  I hear she’s become very hostile.

Coleman—who gave birth to three children during her five years in captivity—and Boyle were kidnapped by the Haqqani Network soon after they arrived in Afghanistan in 2012, the Guardian reports.  The FBI is dedicated to not only bring American citizens back home, but also to bring them justice after years in captivity,  said FBI official Timothy R. Slater, though he did not explain why the bureau waited until now to offer a reward. Coleman is now estranged from Boyle, who was charged with sexual assault and forcible confinement soon after they arrived in Canada. She has custody of their children and now lives in Pennsylvania. The charges against Boyle were dismissed last year. Coleman says Boyle had Taliban sympathies which she did not share.  For the perspective of people who may still have questions of whether our five years in captivity was 'voluntary,' this certainly does clear that up,  she tells ABC.  The US government wouldn't offer a million dollars to catch our kidnappers if they thought otherwise.  Last year, she said she feared Boyle more than the Taliban guards during their years in captivity.",FBI Offers $1M Reward for Caitlan Coleman's Captors,FBI Offers $____M Reward for Caitlan Coleman's Captors,1,Copy( 1 ),0
"(Feb 14, 2010  11:40 AM) Twelve Afghans died today when two rockets fired at insurgents missed their target by 1,000 feet and struck a house during the second day of NATO's ambitious effort to break the Taliban's grip on the country's dangerous south. Thousands of US and Afghan forces encountered pockets of resistance, fighting off sniper attacks, as they moved deeper into Marjah, a town of 80,000 people that is the linchpin of the militants' logistical and opium-smuggling network in Helmand province. The civilian deaths were a blow to NATO and the Afghan government's attempts to win the allegiance of Afghans and get them to turn away from the insurgents.  We deeply regret this tragic loss of life,  said Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who said he had apologized to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Karzai had yesterday pleaded with military leaders to be  seriously careful for the safety of civilians.  Meanwhile, a top Marine commander predicted it could take weeks to completely reclaim Marjah.

In the video, a man IDed as TJ Williams is seen hanging out with two other men, listening to music and smoking, when a few minutes into the clip shots start ringing out, continuing for about 20 seconds, WVEC notes; around 30 shots were fired. Williams dropped the phone onto the floor, where it continued recording for more than an hour afterward. Norfolk Police say they found three men, ages 27 and 29, with gunshot wounds, NBC News reports. The police later tweeted that all three men were taken to a local hospital, two with life-threatening injuries. A police rep confirmed the Facebook video was indeed tied to a Bainbridge Boulevard shooting being investigated, per the New York Daily News. A few seconds after the shooting (which can be partly seen in a brief WTKR news clip), a man's voice can be heard saying,  Call the ambulance, please,  and soon after that, another man can be heard comforting the victims.

She speaks calmly and deliberately, inspiring the kind of trust that would ease any jewelry store employee eager to make a high-dollar sale. And that's exactly how cops say the 85-year-old has managed to walk off with pricey jewels in countless thefts around the world over six decades. Asked about her exploits, she speaks in broad terms laced with insinuation, refusing to give specifics of how she selects a target or what she says.  I don't dictate what happens when I walk in the store. The people in charge dictate what happens with me when I walk in the store,  Payne recently told the AP.  I don't tell a person in the store I want to see something that costs $10,000. They make those decisions based on how I present myself and how I look.  Asked about jewelry she's said to have stolen, Payne interrupts the question.  I've never, ever walked out of a jewelry store with a piece of stolen merchandise in my purse, in my pocket,  she said.  Never. I've never, ever concealed.  Police would dispute her claim. She was arrested in October and accused of pocketing a $690 pair of earrings from a Christian Dior boutique in a Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Atlanta. Payne was raised in West Virginia and moved with her family to Ohio when she was a teenager. After high school, she worked in a nursing home on and off for about four years. That's the only  real job  she ever had.  I could have been more than what I was,  she said.  I'm aware of that.  Asked to describe what she's been in her life, she's quick to answer:  I was a thief. You know that,  she said with a chuckle. The legend of Payne's thefts have long fascinated the public and media. And while she said she doesn't have an ego, she wouldn't mind seeing a movie made about her life. Her pick to star: Kerry Washington from Scandal.  If it should happen, I hope I'm around long enough to make sure it happens right,  she said.  I know what I've done. I'm not too ashamed of it.",85-Year-Old: 'I Was a Thief.

It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess,  the Chinese tech billionaire said Tuesday. He addressed the jobs plan, made after he met with then president-elect Donald Trump in January 2017, on Wednesday:  This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis. This promise can't be completed.  CNN provides background, explaining Ma's  vague promise  didn't involve building Alibaba facilities in the US, but rather by helping fire up small US businesses by enabling them to better tap into the Chinese market. The Wall Street Journal also uses the word  vague  to describe how critics viewed Ma's pledge, observing that, nearly two years later, Alibaba hasn't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far. Count the Washington Post among those critics. It points out that based on Commerce Department figures, 1 million new American jobs would require that US exports to China rise by an additional $206 billion a year.

That's what the Wall Street Journal reports the founders of WhatsApp did in exiting Facebook prior to November. That's the month when their unvested shares would have fully vested, write Kirsten Grind and Deepa Seetharaman in the lengthy piece based on interviews with people close to the situation. Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $22 billion in 2014, a price nearly 10 times greater than that of its second biggest acquisition, and there has been a culture clash ever since. Founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton remained fiercely focused on privacy and eschewing ads as Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  grew impatient  for a return on that meaty investment—though Facebook had initially promised to keep its hands off the messaging app. Per Grind and Seetharaman's sources, when Acton exited in September he left $900 million in unvested shares on the table; Koum, who on April 30 said he was going, too, is expected to give up $400 million worth of shares. Acton originally tried to fight that, say sources, by pointing to an atypical clause in his and Koum's contract that said that if Facebook pushed  additional monetization initiatives,  the two could bow out with  good reason  and see all their shares vest—so long as they were employed by Facebook when the monetization effort went into effect. Acton, who is said to be worth $3 billion, reportedly backed down after Facebook indicated it would fight him on it. Read the full article, which also gets into quibbles over office chairs, here.

The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly [that were] provided by the manufacturer but were not able to control the aircraft,  said transportation minister Dagmawit Moges, reports the BBC. In a news conference, she explained that the jet experienced  repetitive, uncommanded aircraft nose-down conditions  before it went down, per the New York Times. She urged manufacturer Boeing to review the plane's flight-control system, keeping the focus on a stall-control safety feature called MCAS that has been widely blamed not only for the Ethiopian crash but for an earlier one in Indonesia. The AP points out one area that isn't clear—whether the pilots followed Boeing's precise emergency instructions, which call for pilots to disconnect the MCAS system.  The pilots have turned the MCAS on and off, but I can't say how many times because we will find that out when we have the final report,  Dagmawit tells the Times. Boeing says it will wait to review the report before commenting. The airline already said it was working on a software fix to the MCAS, which is designed to detect and correct a too-steep ascent by pushing the plane's nose down.

Italian authorities plan to refashion the former World War II radio station Morandi occupies into an environmental observatory, meaning the 81-year-old caretaker must clear out.

Now Oregon state archaeologist Dennis Griffin says it is indeed a shipwreck, and that two wood samples taken from the boat's 21-foot keel are currently being tested, with results expected later this month, reports the AP. The tests should help pinpoint what type of lumber was used in construction, which in turn could point to the boat's origins. And while the tests won't determine age, a volunteer at the Columbia River Maritime Museum who's visited the site says it's probably a 20th-century vessel, reports the Daily Astorian. To Griffin, it's an exciting find because of what it might tell us about the past.  It's about historical value,  he says.  We don't place monetary value on these sites.  He says that more than 3,000 wrecks are known to be off Oregon's rugged coastline, but the state database has the locations of barely more than 300. Whether this particular ship is from the logging, fishing, or commercial industries, learning more about it helps  tie us more into the land that we now live in.  But the remains won't be moved; out of the water, sand is the best medium for preserving the wood, which would otherwise cost a lot of money to preserve in a plastic solution in a large tank, Griffin adds.

On Tuesday, West's Very Good Touring company sued various syndicates of Lloyd's of London for $10 million, claiming the insurers are dragging their feet on paying out a  multi-million dollar claim  taken out in the event West may have to cancel shows, reports People. West filed a loss claim with the insurers two days after his hospitalization, but the lawsuit states that since then, the insurers haven't provided  anything approaching a coherent explanation  for why they haven't paid the claim—or, in fact, offered any guarantees they ever will, the Hollywood Reporter reports. West's personal doctor offered a sworn statement to the insurers that West suffered a  debilitating medical condition  that prevented him from touring, and the lawsuit claims that diagnosis was backed up by another doctor handpicked by the insurers. Regardless of the doctors' statements, insurers are hunting  for some contrived excuse not to pay  West, including his marijuana use, according to the lawsuit, which also alleges the insurers leaked  privileged, private, and personal information  about West to the media. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing.

Only three of these vehicles were built, and just one survives to this day, so when it was announced that RM Sotheby's was putting it up for auction, the automotive aficionado world lit up, with predictions the car would go for as much as $20 million. But a current glimpse at the auctioneer's website after Saturday's much-hyped event shows a  still for sale  notice, the result of what Jalopnik calls a  weird and unsatisfying ending.  Bloomberg explains an opening bid of $30 million jump-started what appeared to be a fierce bidding war, rising all the way to $70 million—until the auctioneer suddenly corrected himself, noting the top bid was $17 million, not $70 million. A video of the auction shows the bizarre incident unfolding. Whether it had been an accident or, as Jalopnik puts it, a joke meant to hype the sale and boost bidding, potential buyers were miffed, and no one ever topped the $17 million bid. MSNBC notes that because $17 million was below the seller's minimum price, the sale was nixed.  A massive f---up,  one observer notes, per Bloomberg.  As bidding opened ... increments were mistakenly overheard and displayed on the screen, causing unfortunate confusion in the room,  RM Sotheby's says in a statement.

The bodies of the 10, as well as that of an elderly woman found dead but not hanged, were discovered Sunday morning by a neighbor who went to the shop the family ran. The Times of India reports the family was allegedly hanged using cables and scarves that featured religious designs; cotton was reportedly found in their ears. Police originally said no suicide note was discovered, but a police statement now specifies that they did find handwritten notes that suggested there was involvement in  definite spiritual and mystical practices  that may be tied to the deaths, reports the BBC. The Hindustan Times has much more on the alleged writings, with an unnamed officer suggesting the family might have been participating in a religious ritual that they believed would end with God saving them from death. The notes allegedly detailed the days of the week on which the ritual could occur and specified how the bodies needed to be arranged, with certain men and women together and widows kept apart.  Almost every step mentioned in the note seems to be have been religiously followed by the family,  per the officer. He added that only one woman was unrestrained, indicating she could have bound the hands of the others.

"(Sep 7, 2016  9:36 AM CDT) Police in San Luis Obispo, Calif., are following the  most promising lead we've had in years  in the hopes of finding some trace of a California Polytechnic State University freshman who vanished 20 years ago. Human decomposition dogs  and other information  led police and the FBI to three sites on the campus—including one spot marked by the  P  in a giant hillside sign for Cal Poly—which will now be excavated over four days, reports the Los Angeles Times. Without elaborating, police say evidence  strongly suggests  Kristin Smart may be buried at one of the sites, per the San Luis Obispo Tribune. The 19-year-old student disappeared after leaving an off-campus party in the early hours of May 25, 1996. A witness told police that Paul Flores, 19, offered to walk Smart home after she'd apparently passed out. Flores—who's considered a person of interest but has never been charged due to a lack of evidence, police say—claims he dropped Smart off near her dorm, though the Tribune notes four cadaver dogs reacted separately to Flores' dorm room, focusing on a mattress and wastebasket, after he moved out in June 1996. The Smart family has sued Flores in civil court, though searches at properties linked to the Flores family have turned up no sign of Smart.

"(Nov 24, 2016  9:22 AM) All that's left of the dodo bird is a smattering of bones—a nearly complete set of which has just sold for $431,000 at auction. This  extremely rare  version is one of the most complete with about 95% of bones present, reports the BBC. Only a portion of the skull and a set of claws are lacking, reports CNN. The skeleton—believed to be the first sold since 1914—was actually pieced together over four decades by a collector, which isn't atypical.  There are only twelve close to complete dodo skeletons in the world,  all in the possession of museums, and all but one are composites, says Erroll Fuller of Summers Place Auctions in the UK. Found on Mauritius in the 16th century, the dodo disappeared by the late 1600s at the hands of humans and newly introduced dogs and monkey, Fuller says. Most of the bones that make up existing dodos were taken from Mauritius in the 19th century, but the island has since banned their export. That's one reason people were so interested in the skeleton. But the dodo also  represents extinction and how fast man can influence the environment,  says Fuller.  Whether we're actually learning the lesson, I don't think I'd like to say,  he adds, per CBS News. The BBC spoke to the unnamed collector who pieced together the bird, whose initial purchase was a foot bone in the 1970s. He didn't imagine it would lead to full skeleton.

The hospital's research center will receive the largest portion of a $188 million charitable trust left by Jack MacDonald, who died at the age of 98 after decades of secret philanthropy, reports the Seattle Times. Only a select few family and friends knew that the bargain-hunting man who lived simply in a retirement home had spent more than 60 years using his incredible skill for picking stocks to turn the nest egg his parents left him into a huge legacy for charity. The trust will also benefit the University of Washington School of Law and the Salvation Army. MacDonald, who served in the South Pacific in World War II before spending 30 years as an attorney for the Veterans Administration, supported hundreds of other causes with donations while he was alive, including $150,000 to the Canadian village his grandfather moved to from Scotland. The president of the Seattle Children’s Foundation describes MacDonald as a humble, understated man who regularly visited the hospital and sympathized with the patients and their families.

"(Nov 17, 2015  4:35 AM) James Byrd is a sadistic, ruthless Aryan Brotherhood of Texas kingpin, and prosecutors have won a long fight to keep him out of federal prison. Instead, Tarrant County prosecutor Allenna Bangs tells the Houston Chronicle, the 45-year-old will serve a 50-year sentence in a Texas state prison, where his gang affiliation will be enough to have him kept in solitary, unable to conduct the white supremacist gang's business in a prison yard. In federal prison, such gang involvement doesn't justify solitary.  He will be in a box for 23 hours a day,  Bangs tells the Chronicle.  That will be 50 very hard years.  She says it was tough to secure a conviction against Byrd since most witnesses—including a man he stabbed 37 times in the face—were too terrified to testify against him. He was eventually convicted of directing gang activities. Prosecutors say Byrd's brutality helped him rise through the gang's ranks in prison and he was just as savage during five months of freedom he had beginning in late 2013, when he worked as a gang enforcer among ex-cons. In an attack that landed him back in prison, prosecutors say Byrd stabbed a fellow gang member, soaked a slice of white bread in his blood, and then ate half. The bleeding gang member was then ordered to eat the other half.  This guy was like an episode of Sons of Anarchy,  Tarrant County prosecutor Joshua Ross tells the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

"(Jun 7, 2012  2:00 AM CDT) US drug agents nabbed dozens of baggage handlers, American Airlines workers and others in a raid on Puerto Rico's main airport.  We have dismantled the two most significant drug operations at the airport,  said the acting special agent in charge of the DEA's Caribbean division. At least 33 people were busted at San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin airport, along with two workers at Miami's international airport, and another at Dallas-Fort Worth, reports AP. The sophisticated drug-running operation has functioned for years with heroin hand-offs in bathrooms, and suitcases packed with cocaine that were transported via commercial airlines, reports the BBC. Some 14 tons of cocaine and several pounds of heroin were moved from Puerto Rico to cities including Miami, New York, Boston and Newark. Among all the 45 suspects busted or still sought, 18 worked for American Airlines and 12 were employees of a baggage handling service at the San Juan airport.  They put the security of all passengers at risk,  said US Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez. One busted suspect was the driver of Puerto Rico Sen. Lornna Soto, who represents the district where the airport is located, and is a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Agents are still seeking a government worker with Puerto Rico's Port Authority. A spokesman for American said the airline supports prosecuting individuals responsible  to the fullest extent of the law,  adding:  We have a zero-tolerance policy for any employee when it comes to this type of activity.",18 American Airlines Workers Hunted in PR Drug Raid,____ American Airlines Workers Hunted in PR Drug Raid,18,Copy( 18 ),0

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank almost 800 points Tuesday. Boeing and Caterpillar, two major exporters which would have much to lose of trade tensions don't ease, weighed the most on the Dow. Bond prices soared sharply, sending yields lower, as traders shoved money into lower-risk investments. The sharp drop in yields hurt banks because it makes it harder to earn money from lending.

Of the 11 deaths, seven were from drowning and four from traffic accidents, the state Department of Public Safety reports; two additional deaths took place in North Carolina from traffic accidents, per that state's emergency management agency. Bridges have also collapsed, more than 500 roads have been severely damage, and tens of thousands are still without drinking water or power, per ABC News.

Officials issued a mea culpa to Bishop Daryl Harris and his Total Life Christian Ministries church after slapping it with a lawsuit for a $170,000 electric bill, the Detroit Free Press reports. Harris may have owned up to the bill if it were actually his—but it turns out his church has a similar name to the church that really owes the money, one of 10 organizations Detroit went after in court for funds owed to the Detroit Public Lighting Department. The city also shut off the water at the home he shares with his wife, 15-year-old twins, and elderly mother, then hit him a $30 reconnection fee.

"(Jun 26, 2019  8:11 AM CDT) Two NOAA scientists were asked why the federal government waited 14 years to conduct a study of an oil spill that started in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004. They didn't know, reports the Washington Post, but as the ones asked to do the study they could put a figure on what's still pouring out of the site all this time later: as many as 4,578 gallons daily. The oil platform was located in an underwater canyon some 12 miles from Louisiana and leased by the Taylor Energy Company—which claims just 3 gallons are seeping out daily. Monster waves churned up by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, triggered an undersea mudslide that took down the platform and more than two dozen well pipes, which were buried in more than 100 feet of sediment. Taylor Energy claims the oil is seeping out of the oil-soaked sediment. The report commissioned by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement found the oil is coming from a number of wells. The AP explains nine wells were capped by Taylor Energy, but the company has maintained it's more environmentally prudent to leave 16 of them buried than try to cap them. Gizmodo puts the new numbers in context, reporting they make for a cumulative spill of 25 million gallons; the Deepwater Horizon Spill was more than six times bigger, at 168 million gallons. The Weather Channel reports news of the former spill only publicly emerged in 2010, as scientists discovered it while looking into the latter spill; no coastal environmental damage has been reported. The researchers relied on sonar and a newly developed  bubblometer  to measure the leakage. (Taylor Energy is fighting a federal order to stop that leakage.)",The Oil Started Spilling in 2004.

"(Oct 30, 2014  8:26 AM CDT) Parents' happiness soars with their first child, but that increase is cut in half by their second, and there's only a negligible increase in happiness by the time the third comes along, a new study finds. What's more, parents who are the most educated and who give birth at 35 to 49 years of age report the largest, longest-lasting spikes in happiness, while those who are 23 to 34 feel happier at first but quickly return to baseline or even slightly lower happiness levels. Teens actually experience a decline in happiness that doesn't go above normal levels within the first year of birth, reports Smithsonian.  The fact that among older and better-educated parents, well-being increases with childbearing, but the young and less-educated parents have flat or even downward happiness trajectories, may explain why postponing fertility has become so common,  one researcher tells the Daily Mail. The study, published in the journal Demography, analyzed data submitted by more than 7,000 parents in the UK and Germany as part of the German Socio-Economic Panel and the British Household Panel Survey. Researchers looked at how people reported their happiness levels alongside whether they were preparing for or recently had a baby. They did not, however, parse the effects of having multiples instead of singletons.

"(Sep 16, 2019  1:28 PM CDT) Last time out, documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock ate only fast food for a month. This time, he's the one dishing out the fried stuff, the AP reports. Spurlock has gone from being an avid Big Mac consumer in Super Size Me to serving his own fast-food chicken sandwiches in Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!—a sober look at an industry that processes 9 billion animals a year in America. Ironically, Spurlock's film about fast-food chicken reemerges during a food feud over fried-chicken sandwiches, with the nation obsessed with a Popeyes version. The documentary was released Friday and is already available for streaming, Today reports. In it, Spurlock sets up his own chicken farm to raise chickens that will then be used at his own fast-food restaurant, Holy Chicken. Today notes that among the truths the film exposes is the fact that in order for chicken to be labeled  free range,  it need only have access to a tiny outdoor space. The label does not necessarily mean the chicken actually roamed outside. Spurlock, attempting to recreate this condition in the film, actually had to chase his chickens to get them to even approach the door; they were too large to feel like being active in the hot outdoors. Spurlock says the movie also reveals how poorly chicken farmers are treated by  Big Chicken.

Two more patients died in hospitals following the evacuation of the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills on Wednesday, bringing the total number of dead to eight. Three patients died at the facility earlier Wednesday, while three others died in hospitals. The deceased ranged in age from 71 to 99 and their causes of death are not yet clear. But the medical director at a hospital across the street from the facility, where evacuees were taken, says most were treated for  respiratory distress, dehydration, and heat-related issues,  per Local 10. He adds at least 12 other patients are in emergency care. The Rehabilitation Center has been barred from admitting patients as agencies investigate. Hollywood police are also conducting a criminal investigation.

"(Jun 20, 2012  9:02 AM CDT) The political world is buzzing today over a new Bloomberg poll that shows Barack Obama clobbering Mitt Romney by a whopping 53% to 40% margin. This comes despite voters widely disapproving of Obama's handling of the economy—only 43% approve, while 53% disapprove. So why is Obama winning? Because voters just plain don't like Romney. Only 39% view him favorably, and 55% say he is more  out of touch,  with voters. A plurality also say they're better off now than four years ago. Forty-five percent say they're better off, to only 36% who say they're worse off.  I'm just tired of the doom and gloom,  says one independent voter.

"(Jan 3, 2015  7:10 AM)  Think before you jerk.   Jerking isn’t a joke.  Such slogans, as reported in the Washington Post and elsewhere, garnered national attention when used to remind drivers in South Dakota not to over-correct their steering on slick roads. Indeed, the standard theory behind the way we steer our cars dates back to the 1940s but has left us with a longstanding mystery: data shows that we have a habit of jerking the wheel from time to time, puzzling researchers. Now, experts in Sweden are explaining the phenomenon, and their findings could lead to better safety systems in cars, according to a release at Eureka Alert. The jerkiness is tied to the way humans reach for things: When something is close by, we move our arms more slowly to grab it than we do when it's further away. The result is that both movements take the same amount of time.  We immediately recognized this pattern  as similar to steering behaviors, a researcher says.  It was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behavior also controlled how we steer a car?  A study of more than 1,000 hours of drivers' movements suggests that it certainly was. The team developed a mathematical model addressing the behavior; now,  it is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future,  the researcher says. That could improve safety: For instance, if a sleepy driver is edging off the road, his car's support system could predict how much he's going to jerk the wheel to try to correct things, often disastrously, and intervene to prevent it.

Pithovirus sibericum, a member of a recently discovered class of giant viruses, was found 100 feet deep in the frozen ground. It only infects amoebas, but the researchers who uncovered it fear that plenty more ancient viruses are locked into the permafrost and could be unleashed as it thaws, Nature reports. The region is becoming both warmer and more accessible, which  is a recipe for disaster,  one of the researchers says.

Through mining and drilling, those old layers will be penetrated and this is where the danger is coming from,  he tells the BBC, warning that  if it is true that these viruses survive in the same way those amoeba viruses survive, then smallpox is not eradicated from the planet—only the surface.

The beehive became a cultural phenomenon during the 1960s and evolved into a style worn for decades as Hollywood's stars walked red carpets. Heldt created it on the request of a hairstyling magazine that published images of it in February 1960 and called it  the beehive  because of its conical shape. Heldt said the inspiration for the hairstyle came from a little black velvet hat, shaped like a small bump and lined inside with red lace. Heldt went downstairs one night while her family was sleeping, put on music, and started working with hair on a mannequin head to come up with her creation. Heldt grew up in Chicago and loved hair as a child. She won a beauty school scholarship in high school, but her family couldn't afford to buy her a hair switch—a piece of fabric with long hair attached so students could practice—so she cut her mother's long hair into a short bob and sewed that onto burlap to use in class. She passed the state board exam in 1935 and opened her own salon, Margaret Vinci Coiffures, on Michigan Avenue in 1950. She won the National Coiffure Championship in 1954.

"(Jun 27, 2011  2:43 PM CDT) Former Citigroup vice president Gary Foster has been charged with embezzling more than $19 million from the company. Foster, 35, was nabbed yesterday at JFK airport in New York, after arriving on a flight from Bangkok, Reuters reports. Prosecutors say that between May 2009 and December 2010, Foster funneled the money from Citi’s debt-adjustment and income-expense accounts into his personal JPMorgan account, using fake contract and deal numbers to hide the transactions. Citi didn’t notice the theft until a recent audit. When investigators found it, they immediately alerted the FBI.

"(Sep 30, 2011  5:45 AM CDT) After Beethoven scrapped a movement from a string quartet, it was lost to the world’s ears for two centuries. No longer: A music professor in Britain has recreated the piece using the composer’s sketches for every measure. The movement of String Quartet in G, Opus 18, No. 2 was performed for the first time in 200 years—perhaps the first time ever—at Manchester University, the Telegraph reports. After Beethoven had written a group of six string quartets, he reworked the first two, the Guardian notes, ditching the second movement of the Quartet in G. Only the sketches for the movement remain; Professor Barry Cooper filled out missing parts and put them in order. He  made the jigsaw fit, and also made it performable,  Cooper says.

"(Jun 1, 2013  10:31 AM CDT) Dean Brooks ran Oregon's state psychiatric hospital for nearly three decades and gained a reputation as a patients' advocate and an innovator in how they were treated. That's why his obituary—he died Thursday at age 96—is in Oregon's Statesman Journal. But the reason he has a lengthy writeup in the New York Times as well has more to do with his role in the Jack Nicholson classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Brooks allowed the 1975 movie to be shot at Oregon State Hospital and served as a technical adviser. He so impressed the crew that he got a speaking role as the fictional hospital's Dr. Spivey. The Times notes an interesting twist: Brooks came off stilted when he read lines, so the filmmakers decided to let him and Nicholson ad-lib their scenes together, including Nicholson's intake interview.

The only clue remains two long streaks of oil in the water. The Boeing 777 had reported no problems before disappearing from radar, and authorities are nowhere near ready to speculate on what might have gone wrong. But most coverage is now taking note of one suspicious-seeming fact: Two of the passengers appeared to be traveling with stolen passports, reports the New York Times. Specifically, an Austrian and an Italian listed on the manifest had their passports stolen previously in Thailand, reports AP. Which may not mean anything, of course, and the Wall Street Journal quotes a European security official as saying it's not that unusual for stolen passports to turn up. But it's fishy enough to catch the attention of US security officials.  We are aware of the reporting on the two stolen passports,  one tells NBC News.  We have not determined a nexus to terrorism yet, although it’s still very early, and that’s by no means definitive.

"(Jan 4, 2016  8:00 AM) Students at a primary school in Scotland are set to get a real-life forensics lesson thanks to a centuries-old skeleton—believed to be that of a pirate—found last year beneath their playground, the Telegraph reports. Workers unearthed the remains while doing survey work for a planned extension at Victoria Primary School in Edinburgh. Initially believed to be from the Bronze Age due to their poor condition, the remains have since been carbon dated to the 16th or 17th century, according to a press release. Based on a facial reconstruction of the skull, it is believed that the skeleton belonged to a man in his 50s. Archaeologists have determined, the press release says,  that the skeleton was likely to have been a murder victim—and quite possibly a pirate.  That conclusion is supported by a gibbet—a type of gallows the release notes was  commonly used to execute witches and pirates —that stood 600 years ago near where the school is now located. And, the man was unceremoniously buried close to sea, rather than in nearby graveyards. His body was likely  displayed in plain sight of ships to deter fellow pirates  before being  discarded in nearby wasteland,  per the release. Given the school's proximity to the harbor in the historic fishing village of Newhaven, workers had anticipated finding remains of the original harbor and shipbuilding. The pupils think it’s fantastic that a skeleton was found deep underneath their playground,  the head teacher says, adding that the archaeologists plan to hold a special lesson for them about the find.

"(Apr 16, 2020  4:05 PM CDT) The 6 feet of separation touted by the CDC might not be enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, particularly among runners. A new study described in the New York Times suggests air carries respiratory droplets up to 30 feet behind runners and up to 15 feet behind fast walkers, meaning anyone in that vicinity could become infected. There's reason to be cautious because the study, based on computer models, hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal and didn't look at coronavirus particles specifically.  Still, its calculations make sense,  per the Times. The study found large respiratory droplets were pulled into the long, narrow slipstream behind a runner or walker—about the width of the person's shoulders. A team from Oklahoma State University similarly found that a person running a 10-minute-mile pace behind another runner would be exposed to droplets even with 6 feet of distance maintained, per WFXT. The team concluded that even a light breeze could carry droplets farther than 6 feet, suggesting such a distance is only suitable for social distancing in static ambient air. A third study out of Western University, looking at how influenza is passed through coughs, found droplets traveled 6 feet in three seconds before continuing  well beyond the recommended six feet,  per the National Post. Droplets might even travel up to 27 feet, per Quartz, which notes the CDC's social distancing guideline  may be outdated.

But they didn't have much time to process them—the first came 7 seconds before impact, reports the Wall Street Journal. Three seconds after the first  sink rate  alarm sounded in the cockpit, one of the two pilots said the runway was in sight, but the plane soon clipped power wires and slammed into a hill. A veteran pilot was at the controls: Cerea Beal had 8,600 flying hours with UPS—3,000 alone in A300 cargo planes, the type that went down—and before that served as a Maine helicopter pilot. But it's unclear whether he had ever landed at this particular runway before at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. Authorities say it's tricky because it's not equipped with the electronics for a full instrument landing and thus requires a visual approach. The crash occurred in the pre-dawn dark, while it was raining.  When I heard they were using Runway 18, it caught my attention because of that hill,  a commercial pilot tells AP.

"(Sep 21, 2016  10:31 AM CDT) It's not wholly unexpected that the demise of Brangelina would spur a longform piece, and Anne Helen Petersen provides it at Buzzfeed. In 2,476 words, Petersen takes us on the familiar journey of how the couple came to be and then not be, but does it through the lens of a calculated Jolie who  continues to masterfully control the publicity narrative around her.  She's been in the driver's seat before: In the wake of Brad Pitt's divorce filing from Jennifer Aniston in January 2005, and that W magazine photo shoot of Pitt and Jolie six months later, Jolie  ran a perfect publicity game by seeming like she wasn’t playing one at all.  Like pulling a railroad switch, she didn't speak of the scandal but generated a new conversation—about human rights, and refugees—by skillfully employing press photos and  speeches that had nothing to do with her own love life.  Slowly, writes Petersen, people began to cheer for  Team Jolie.  And she's engineering our view once again. Petersen points out that the filing comes just in advance of Pitt's Oscar campaign for Allied—a period in which it would behoove Pitt to rock as few boats as possible. She didn't break the news through the media but  allowed  (quotation marks are Petersen's) the news to eventually come out via the discovery of the legal documents,  effectively creating a gossip vacuum  that was rapidly filled with negative press about Pitt.

I was determined to share my positive approach and not let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life,  Deen says.  I'm excited to team up with Novo Nordisk on this initiative to show others that managing diabetes does not have to stop you from enjoying the things you love,  says Deen, who maintains that she's still going to eat the way she wants, albeit with daily doses of Victoza and  lifestyle adjustments, including lightened-up versions of her favorite recipes.  Deen critic Anthony Bourdain, who famously called her  the worst, most dangerous person in America,  says he  takes no pleasure  in the news. But he's not exactly sympathetic, either: When  you've been cheerfully selling this stuff knowing all along that you've got Type 2 diabetes ... it's in bad taste if nothing else.

That included $1.67 trillion spent to save the economy, health insurance for 32 million people, and new regulations on Wall Street; in the lame-duck session alone, there was the tax cut deal,  Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell  repeal, START treaty ratification, and 9/11 health bill.

Prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand identified the suicide bomber behind Saturday's blasts as 28-year-old Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen with roots in the Middle East who has lived in Britain for the past 10 years. Though he had apparently harbored radical ideas for some time, Lindstrand said he was completely unknown to Swedish security police before the blasts. Parts of the explosives probably detonated by mistake before Abdulwahab reached his final destination, he said.  He had three sets of bombs and I don't think his intention was to blow himself up only,  Lindstrand said.  It was a failure, luckily.  He said Abdulwahab had bombs strapped to his body, more in a backpack and also carried  something that looked like a pressure-cooker ... He was well-equipped with bomb material, so I guess it isn't a too daring guess to say he was on his way to a place where there were as many people as possible.",Stockholm Attacker Had 3 Sets of Bombs,Stockholm Attacker Had ____ Sets of Bombs,3,Trans( three ),1

Researchers studying the Greenland shark estimate the oldest of their 28 specimens is 392 years old, give or take 120 years, Science reports. They tell NPR they're 95% sure Greenland sharks live between 272 and 512 years. That would make the sharks the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, according to Time. The bowhead whale was the previous record holder, living up to 211 years, so even 272 years is a massively long lifespan. The shocked researchers published their findings Thursday. Researchers deduced the shark's age by carbon dating its eyes. National Geographic reports the Greenland shark hadn't been heavily studied in the past due to living in the remote North Atlantic and being hard to find. A geneticist believes the cold water in the sharks' home is responsible for their long lives, slowing their metabolic rates and turning on an anti-aging gene. Meanwhile a biologist specializing in aging is suddenly interested in studying the Greenland shark.  There's something going on in those muscles,  he tells NPR.

The bank intends to cut costs as much as $19 billion in coming years, CNBC reports. That would leave it with 74,000 employees by 2022. The bank expects to report a net loss of more than $3 billion for the second quarter. There was no word on where the jobs would be cut, but the bank is dropping all business involving the buying and selling of shares, and much of that work happens in London and New York. Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board finalized the restructuring plan Sunday. The restructuring signals that Deutsche Bank is abandoning its ambition to be a global trading powerhouse, per the Wall Street Journal. After years of decline, the bank will retreat to being a German bank concentrating on serving European companies and retail-banking customers. The plan calls for enhancing segments such as asset management, currency trading, corporate-cash management and trade finance. Incremental cuts and exploring mergers hasn't helped. The bank still will face challenges in cutting the costs and assets involved with the operations it wants to shed.

Researchers from the American Cancer Society have identified a sharp rise in colon and rectal cancer rates among millennials and GenXers after reviewing some 500,000 cases dating to 1974. How sharp? Their study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, finds people born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer as someone born in 1950. And here's the longer view:  Colorectal cancer risk among millennials has escalated back to the level of those born  circa 1890, says lead study author Rebecca Siegel in a statement picked up by Live Science. About 135,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with the cancers (and 50,000 die each year, reports USA Today), but those 55 and younger now make up an appreciable number of diagnoses: 29% of rectal cancer and 17% of colon cancer cases.  Colorectal cancer had been thought a success story,  as increased screening tamped down overall rates, says Siegel. But what researchers found is a dichotomy between the younger and older groups. For instance, rectal cancer rates were down over the 1974 to 2013 study period for those 55 and up, but grew 3.2% annually for those ages 20 to 29. And  anything more than about 1% a year is a big change,  says Siegel. The researchers didn't identify a cause, but point out a trio of risk factors: obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and a low-fiber diet.",Millennials' Colorectal Cancer Risk Like Those Born in 1890,Millennials' Colorectal Cancer Risk Like Those Born in ____,1890,Copy( 1890 ),0

Fly to St. Louis to visit his 96-year-old mother, who never doubted his innocence. Wilson, now 62, was convicted in 1986 of stabbing a man sleeping in a truck in Los Angeles, KABC reports. According to the Los Angeles Times, the victim had a disorder that kept his blood from clotting. For the past three decades, Wilson has maintained that he didn't do it. And while his actual innocence is still up in the air, it's now official that he didn't receive a fair trial. The DA's office has admitted that  cumulative errors  added up to an unfair trial for Wilson. Those errors include allegedly withholding evidence that the victim's girlfriend—the only witness to the crime—had previously filed a false police report regarding kidnapping and rape. Also allegedly withheld: evidence that an LAPD detective directed the girlfriend to a photo of Wilson and that a friend suspected the victim's girlfriend, as she had stabbed the victim in the past. The prosecutor in the murder case denies withholding evidence, and the DA's office maintains that Wilson murdered the victim (though it doesn't plan to retry him).

Quincy Thorpe, 40, was arrested at his Brooklyn home Thursday morning, ABC7 reports. Sources tell the New York Daily News that suspicion fell on Thorpe after he called in sick for the two days after the theft. Authorities say one of eight bags of cash from an armored car company that were being flown to Florida was stolen, but the theft wasn't discovered until after the flight landed in Miami. Thorpe was released on $80,000 bond after a court appearance Thursday afternoon. Federal authorities questioned the flight crew before determining that the cash, which has not been recovered, was stolen in New York. Officials say Thorpe admitted to FBI agents that he had been responsible for loading the bags on the plane. Sources tell the New York Post that the unrecovered cash is a mix of US and foreign currency that came from a cruise ship. Thorpe's lawyer, Lonnie Hart, says he has doubts about the video evidence authorities say they have, and he wonders  how this money would actually be taken out of the airport if there’s surveillance cameras all around.

Nancy Wilson, a three-time Grammy winner and host of NPR's  Jazz Profiles,  died Thursday at her home in Pioneertown, Calif., after a long illness, her manager confirms to NPR. She was 81. Known for telling stories through her music, particularly jazz, Wilson actually dabbled in many genres, from pop to R&B to Broadway show tunes. Born in Ohio, she began testing her pipes at age 4, and was lead singer of her choir by 10, reports the New York Times. Five months after moving to New York in 1959, she'd signed with Capitol Records and put out her first album with Nat King Cole's own producer. Despite no formal training, Wilson went on to release more than 70 albums (including three in a single year), winning the Grammy for best R&B recording in 1964, and two for best jazz vocal album in 2005 and 2007. Her performances of songs like  (You Don’t Know) How Glad I Am  became her signature.  Audiences want to see a song as well as hear it,  as Wilson put it, per the Times.  Part of what I do is in my body language, my hands, my arms. You miss a lot by just hearing my voice.  By 1965, a writer applauded one of her shows as an  extraordinary demonstration of the attainment, by a splendid singer, of an almost unprecedented mixture of commercial appeal, physical and music charm, and artistic integrity.

It puts the count at 196 Democrats, with 30 senators and 166 representatives listed as plaintiffs in a suit filed in federal court that accuses Trump of violating the Constitution. The  emoluments clause  is what's at play here, just as in the suit filed Monday by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, DC. The clause requires Trump to obtain an OK from Congress before accepting payments or gifts from outside governments, and those suing him argue that his businesses have taken in a multitude of payments from foreign governments since his inauguration—absent that approval. The Washington Post reports Connecticut's Sen. Richard Blumenthal led the filing for the Senate, and he invited Republicans to join in (none have done so). His take:  The president’s failure to tell us about these emoluments ... [means] that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don’t know.  University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal tells the Post their chances of success don't look great:  Because this is individual legislators who don’t have any individual injuries, it will be hard for them to get standing.

The numbers are not likely to help the university recoup its image in the wake of its cheating scandal, the LA Times points out. A Harvard spokesman responded to the report by pointing out that cheating was  a national problem,  but said Harvard was taking action against cheating  through faculty and presentations to students.",42% of Harvard Freshmen Admit to Cheating,____% of Harvard Freshmen Admit to Cheating,42,Copy( 42 ),0
"(Dec 24, 2009  10:07 AM) America called a ceasefire in the culture wars this year as the economy and debate on the role of government pushed battles over religion and culture to the back burner, writes EJ Dionne. The change was most apparent on the right, where the loudest voices of protest came from the largely secular tea-party movement instead of Christian conservatives, Dionne writes in the Washington Post. This shift has been seen before, Dionne notes, when cultural issues like the prohibition of alcohol declined in importance during the Great Depression.  The paradox for Obama is that if the economy continues its comeback in 2010, his overall standing will improve, but the risk of renewed conflict over religion and values will also rise.  The president would probably be happy with the trade, Dionne writes.",Culture Wars Took 2009 Off,Culture Wars Took ____ Off,2009,Copy( 2009 ),0
"(Jan 17, 2019  5:02 AM) Otters aren't the first animal to come to mind when most people think of dangerous Florida wildlife—but a run-in with an aggressive and probably rabid one left a woman temporarily unable to walk. Maitland resident Ann-Christine Langselius tells Fox News that she was walking her Goldendoodle on a bridge in a park in the Orlando suburb last week when she saw the animal  running fast  toward her. She says that in a completely unprovoked attack, the otter attacked her right leg then sank its teeth into her left leg—and hung on as she ran for about 25 yards. Langselius, who moved to Florida from northern Sweden 18 months ago, says she required rabies shots and has had trouble walking because of the severe bites.  I've never seen an animal behave like this so I kind of guessed it was ill when it went for me,  Langselius tells the Orlando Sentinel.  But the scariest part was that it didn’t let go. It bit me in the Achilles tendon really badly so it hung on for a long time.  Authorities believe the same otter was responsible for at least two other attacks on Maitland residents. Posters were put up in the park reading  CAUTION: Aggressive Otter Reported in Area.  Authorities say that a couple of days after Langselius was bitten, a police officer shot a rabid otter in a resident's backyard, though they haven't confirmed that it was the same animal responsible for the attacks.

"(Feb 17, 2019  4:15 PM) The family of a woman shot dead by Baltimore police was initially awarded $38 million. Now, that award is zero. A Baltimore County judge cited the doctrine of  civil liability  Thursday in rescinding the award to the family of Korryn Gaines, 23, who was killed during a six-hour standoff with police in 2016, the New York Times reports.  The evidence is clear,  writes Judge Mickey Norman, per CNN.  This Court has found that Corporal [Royce] Ruby is entitled to qualified immunity and therefore, his shooting of Gaines was not unlawful.  Qualified immunity is a doctrine maintaining that government officials on the job are protected from civil liability as long as they don't violate a person's constitutional rights. And by opening fire, Norman ruled, Ruby was only doing his job. The standoff began on Aug. 1, 2016, in Randallstown when police serving warrants for Gaines and her boyfriend say they found her with a shotgun and her 5-year-old boy, Kodi. Ruby says he fired when she raised her weapon, and kept firing when it discharged; his bullets wounded Kodi and killed Gaines. Her family disputes that account, saying she didn't raise the gun and officers were protected behind a brick wall. Either way, prosecutors declined to press criminal charges, but a civil trial granted Gaines' family the award. Now Norman has sided with the officer and relied on a doctrine that has raised concerns about police abuse, per the Times. An attorney representing Kodi—who was set to receive nearly $33 million—says they plan to appeal, per the Baltimore Sun.",Judge Overturns $38M Award for Baltimore Family,Judge Overturns $____M Award for Baltimore Family,38,Copy( 38 ),0

"(Oct 14, 2016  7:45 AM CDT) To all the women living in Manhattan, now might be an economically sensible time to head over to SoHo and stock up on all your feminine products, because neighborhood pharmacy Thompson Chemists just might be waiving your 7%  pink tax.  Owner Jolie Alony tells Gothamist that she wants to  bring awareness on how it feels to be a woman, so the men actually get to feel it,  by which she is referring to the fact that women pay roughly 7% more for personal products marketed to women than they would for the equivalent product marketed to men, as a recent NYC Department of Consumer Affairs report found. The 7% difference is often called the  pink tax  or  tampon tax,  and the Daily Dot reports that there's more: Women's clothes cost more to dry clean, for example, and in many states menstrual products are actually taxed as luxury goods. On Monday, Alony posted two signs out front:  All female customers shop tax free  and  All male customers are subject to a 7% man tax.  It's a bit misleading, as Time reports, given pricing didn't change at all for men but was dropped 7% for women (Alony must still pay sales tax in full, so she's paying the difference out of pocket). She wasn't sure whether she would continue the promotion past Monday. And while she said that at the shop her female customers were  very, very happy  and the men  just laughed,  the story's gone viral and the pharmacy's Facebook page is riddled with one-star reviews and comments decrying the store's  sexist and hateful business practices  and calling the owners  idiots.

"(Aug 2, 2016  7:39 AM CDT) The US government is $100 million richer after the latest ruling in a strange case involving some long-lost gold coins. In 2003, Pennsylvania's Joan Langbord says she found 10  Double Eagle  coins from 1933 in a safe-deposit box that once belonged to her father, jeweler Israel Switt. The rare coins are worth up to $10 million each, per the Washington Post, but there was one big problem: They'd allegedly been smuggled out of the Philadelphia Mint decades earlier. After Langbord sent the coins for authentication in 2004, the government refused to return them, claiming the coins as its rightful property. In a 9-3 decision on Monday, a federal appeals court sided with the government.  Switt knew that the 1933 Double Eagles were embezzled or stolen and that it was illegal to possess them,  a judge said, per Courthouse News. Some 445,500 Double Eagles—with Lady Liberty on the front and an eagle on the back—were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1933 with a face value of $20, but most were melted into gold bars when Franklin Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard. Two were sent to the Smithsonian, but a rare few found their way to collectors, allegedly with the help of a cashier at the Mint. Monday's ruling  properly establishes that the United States is the lawful owner of the 1933 Double Eagle gold coins,  says a US attorney. The decision backs up a 2012 court ruling, overturned in 2015 when an appeals court found the government missed a deadline to respond to Langbord's claim. The panel on Monday found that deadline didn't apply. A lawyer says Langbord will appeal to the Supreme Court, per Reuters. (A hiker found this incredibly rare coin.)",The Gold Could Be Worth $100M.

The  toilet brush  of a tree now standing in one of the city's busiest public squares and being roundly mocked in Italy and around the world makes Charlie Brown's Christmas tree look lush by comparison.

"(Jan 16, 2015  6:59 AM) The British-built Beagle 2 began its fall to Mars on Dec. 19, 2003. It was expected to land on the Red Planet on Christmas Day and begin its search for alien life (its name is a nod to Charles Darwin's HMS Beagle). But it was never heard from again. Now, high-resolution images snapped over the last two years by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show the probe essentially just where it ought to be, within three miles of its target landing location, the BBC reports. It also appears intact. So what happened? The theory based on the images is that one or two of the probe's four  petals  holding its solar panels didn't deploy, perhaps due to a bad bounce or an airbag  not separating sufficiently from the lander,  mission manager Prof. Mark Sims says.  Without full deployment, there is no way we could have communicated with it as the radio frequency antenna was under the solar panels.  The BBC now calls it  one of [the] most glorious near-misses in the history of British exploration,  and UK Space Agency scientists say the mission needs to be relabeled  a great success.  As Sims puts it, the Beagle 2 achieved a trio of feats: landing on Mars, managing to enter its atmosphere, and being the first  controlled landing  on another planet. The BBC reports the probe can't be brought back to life, but  this is not the end of the story,  says Sims.  We will do more imaging and analysis.  The discovery is bittersweet as it follows the death of principal investigator Colin Pillinger last year. He  would be putting in his grant application to go and fix it,  a researcher says, per the Telegraph. His daughter adds,  He would love that this could inspire that next generation to do Beagle 3.

Urban areas led the increase, with cities of between 500,000 and 1 million people seeing a 3.7% jump in rates; murder rates in those cities were up 12.5%, the New York Times reports. In the biggest cities, however, the increase was less pronounced. Cities of 1 million or more saw violent crime increase 1.4%, with murders up 1.5% and rapes 3.2%.

Setting out before Sherpas finished securing the season's ropes to the summit, double amputee Xia Boyu of China reached Everest's peak Monday on his fifth attempt, reports Time. It was a climb 43 years in the making. The 69-year-old lost both his feet to frostbite when he lent his sleeping bag to a sick team member on his first attempt to scale the mountain in 1975, reports the BBC. Years later, both of his legs were amputated below the knee as he battled lymphoma. Still, Xia never gave up hope of setting foot on the highest point on Earth, and though an avalanche and earthquake put an end to planned climbs in 2014 and 2015, he made it to 300 feet from Everest's summit in 2016 before a blizzard forced his team to retreat.

Sam Perone, now 68, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter Tuesday, admitting that he shot 41-year-old Richard Woods in 1992, reports the Dayton Daily News. Perone had been a suspect from the start, given that Woods had visited his store on the night he disappeared on Perone's request. His body was found a month later in a ravine near Perone's store in Lebanon. Blood stains found in the store were inconclusive at the time, but detectives used more modern techniques to ID Woods' blood in both the store and at Perone's home.

The convoluted case took a big turn on Tuesday, though, when a Dodge Ram was stopped in Brunswick, Ga., due to the heavy tint on its windows; the driver was arrested after police discovered he had multiple forms of ID featuring multiple photos, and he eventually revealed himself as Price, telling the sheriff,  Sit down. I'm going to make you famous,  reports the Florida Times-Union. Price was last spotted on June 16, 2012, when he was IDed as boarding a ferry in Key West that was headed for Fort Myers, Fla.; he was seen neither jumping from nor exiting the boat, but he essentially vanished. He had also recently purchased dive weights, and wrote a letter to family and regulators saying he had lost a great deal of money and planned to commit suicide, reports the Albany Herald. A Georgia judge declared him dead, but the FBI didn't believe that was the case. The following month, he was indicted, with prosecutors alleging that he defrauded a Georgia bank of $21 million by wiring money from the Montgomery Bank & Trust to accounts under his control in Florida, reports 11Alive. Per the indictment, Price controlled an investment group that put $10 million in to the failing bank in 2010; he was then put in charge of investing MB&T's capital. He's accused of covering roughly 18 months of embezzling that began in January 2011 by producing  bogus account statements  that appeared to show that the money was secured in an account at a large financial services firm. Price has a court appearance today, and faces up to 30 years in prison for the bank fraud charge.",'Dead' Man Caught After 18 Months on the Run,'Dead' Man Caught After ____ Months on the Run,18,Copy( 18 ),0

"(Jan 26, 2011  11:07 PM) Sick and getting sicker, Social Security will run at a deficit this year and keep on running in the red until its trust funds are drained by about 2037, according to bleaker-than-previous estimates from congressional budget experts. The massive retirement program has been suffering from the effects of the struggling economy for several years. It first went into deficit last year but had been projected to post surpluses for a few more years before permanently slipping into the red in 2016. This year alone, Social Security will pay out $45 billion more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said. That figure nearly triples—to $130 billion—when the new one-year cut in payroll taxes is included. The projected deficits add a sense of urgency to efforts to improve Social Security's finances. For much of the past 30 years, the program has run big surpluses, which the government has borrowed to spend on other programs. Now that Social Security is running deficits, the federal government will have to find money elsewhere to help pay for benefits.",Social Security to Be Drained by 2037,Social Security to Be Drained by ____,2037,Copy( 2037 ),0
"(Oct 28, 2014  4:41 PM CDT) If trekking into the wilds of northern Canada, drilling samples out of the ice core, and analyzing caribou poop to find a pair of really old viruses sounds like your idea of a hot Friday night, well, we present you Eric Delwart. As NPR reports, the viral researcher did just that with 700-year-old caribou scat after it occurred to him that the ice  is nature's freezer, which should also contain organic remains.  And given that animals of all kinds are  constantly shoving viruses down our throat ... if you look at poo samples from humans and from animals you will find a lot of viruses,  he reasoned. Delwart's theory panned out, and he found two previously undiscovered viruses. His results, published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA in one of the viruses was in such great shape that it could be used to infect a plant. And while Delwart doesn't think either is dangerous, NPR offers up this cautionary coda:  As the North warms and ice melts, more caribou poo infected with ancient viruses will be finding its way into the modern ecosystem.

That's what a firefighter in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recorded telling a 911 caller after a 17-year-old was shot at a party. The exchange involved Albuquerque Fire Department driver Matthew Sanchez, who was working dispatch on the night of June 26. In a roughly 30-second portion of the recorded call, posted by KRQE, he's heard twice asking if Jaydon Chavez-Silver was breathing. The caller responds,  He’s barely breathing. How many times do I have to f---ing tell you?  to which Sanchez replies that he isn't going to  deal with this  and then hangs up. Jaydon later died from the gunshot, per KRQE. The fire chief on Monday said Sanchez  was immediately removed from the dispatch center and placed on administrative assignment. An internal investigation has been initiated.  Chief Administrative Officer Rob Perry subsequently announced that Sanchez had resigned from the Albuquerque Fire Department, where he had worked for 10 years, reports KOAT. KOB6 reports that police believe the shooter either walked or drove by the home where about 10 people were gathered and fired as many as six shots; no arrests have been made.

Earl Kimrey, 32, was taken into custody Friday on charges including concealing a death and obstructing justice, ABC reports. He is in jail, with bail set at $1 million, and police say more charges are possible. Arrest warrants say that Kimrey, knowing Mariah died of non-natural causes, moved her body.

They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the  Million Mouse Project  fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none.  This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,  says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel.

The misprint comes from a design that marked the launch of US airmail, featuring a Curtiss JN-4H biplane, nicknamed the Jenny. A wealthy collector, Ethel B. Stewart McCoy, bought a four-stamp block in 1936 and allowed the American Philatelic Society to exhibit them at the 1955 collectors' convention in Norfolk, Va. The stamps disappeared from a display case there, and it's been a whodunit ever since. Two were recovered in 1977 and 1982 from Chicago connoisseurs who had bought them.  I know this case is far from over, and I know our friends in the philatelic world will work very hard to see if they can solve the rest of the mystery,  says the American Philatelic Society's executive director.",Inverted Jenny Stamp Returned for $50K Reward,Inverted Jenny Stamp Returned for $____K Reward,50,"Paraphrase( 50,000 , K )",1

Their companion, 26-year-old Luke Gullberg, was found dead on a glacier over the weekend. Gullberg's equipment was also found scattered around the glacier, including a camera with at least 20 photos of the hikers. Crews have examined the photos for clues to the location of the missing climbers.  It looked like they were confident and having a good time,  said one of the searchers. Avalanche conditions are currently making ground searches impossible. The three were experienced climbers and well equipped for summiting the 11,000 foot mountain, reports AP.

That's the excuse TSA agents heard more than a few times upon discovering 2,212 firearms in people's carry-on luggage at airports last year. That's 22% more than were found in 2013; just 660 firearms turned up in 2005. According to the Department of Homeland Security, agents discovered an average of six guns each day in carry-ons or on a passenger's body. More than 80% were loaded, USA Today reports. When police interviewed the travelers, who face thousands in fines, the most popular excuse was that they'd forgotten the guns were there. Denver, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, and Dallas international airports saw the most firearm discoveries. Passengers are allowed to pack firearms in checked baggage, provided the guns aren't loaded. Another 1,400  dangerous objects  were also discovered last year. Among the more bizarre finds: a hand grenade, as well as an 8.5-inch knife inside an enchilada. In the case of the former, an LAX terminal was closed while a bomb squad intervened. In the latter case, the TSA determined the woman carrying the food forgot she put the knife inside. Stun guns, razors, firearm components, a pen/highlighter hiding small knives, and $1.2 billion in counterfeit goods—including $10 million worth of counterfeit Beats by Dre headphones—were also found.

According to Gizmodo, 195 countries signed a climate pact on Saturday to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. In two decades of climate conferences, this is the first to end in a successful agreement.  Our text is the best possible balance, a balance which is powerful yet delicate, which will enable each delegation, each group of countries, with his head held high, having achieved something important,  French foreign minister Laurent Fabius says. After the pact—the first to legally commit all countries to reducing carbon emissions—was signed, delegates from the 195 countries rose for a standing ovation, the BBC reports. The final agreement represents a compromise between developed and developing countries. Gizmodo reports it calls for nations to keep global warming  well below  2 degrees Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as a target. Countries  already feeling the impacts of climate change  had pushed for the lower limit. Developed countries will commit $100 billion per year to help developing countries, though that commitment isn't legally binding. According to the BBC, nations will have to report on their progress every five years. Gizmodo notes the most optimistic portion of the final agreement is a section calling for net zero carbon emissions sometime in the second half of the 21st century. Wired reports two items not included in the pact are a reduction of air travel and shipping—which account for more than 5% of greenhouse gasses—and reparations for poor countries hurt by climate change.",195 Countries Sign Pact to Fight Global Warming,____ Countries Sign Pact to Fight Global Warming,195,Copy( 195 ),0

In January, a 3-year-old in New Mexico wounded both his parents with one gun shot. In June, a 3-year-old in Michigan died after shooting himself in the head with a gun he found in a closet. In August, a 21-month-old in St. Louis died after shooting himself in the torso at his grandma's house. Just this month, a 2-year-old in South Carolina found a gun in the backseat of the car and shot his grandma, who was riding in the passenger seat. Reporter Christopher Ingraham crunched the numbers for the Post and found at least 43 cases of toddlers shooting themselves or others with a firearm in the news this year. According to Ingraham's stats, 13 toddlers killed themselves, 18 injured themselves, 10 injured someone else, and two killed someone else. He says there are likely many more cases of toddlers firing a gun that didn't make the news. According to one gun safety advocacy group, more than two-thirds of accidental shootings by children could be prevented with responsible gun storage. And 67% of Americans support laws requiring guns to be locked up at home, a measure the NRA opposes.

An episode of the show titled  The End of the World,  which first aired May 9, 1958, depicts a con man named Walter Trump who visits a Texas town and tells them meteors will strike at midnight—but they can be protected by building a wall for $50 a person.

Per an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, its first general-election survey of likely voters, Clinton leads Trump by 6 points. The poll was taken between Sept. 16 and Sept. 19, when Clinton was already back to work after the hubbub surrounding her pneumonia. Clinton nabbed 43% of the 922 likely voters, who said they'd vote for her today, while Trump received 37%. Libertarian Gary Johnson almost hit double digits with 9%, while the Green Party's Jill Stein pulled up the rear with 3% (though her name wasn't offered in states where she's not on the ballot). When narrowed down to just Trump, Clinton, and their running mates, Clinton/Kaine received 48%, while Trump/Pence took 41%.  Despite arguably the worst few weeks of her candidacy, the fundamentals still point toward a Hillary Clinton victory,  a Democratic polling expert who led the survey tells NBC. His GOP counterpart, who conducted the survey with him, notes that Trump has closed the gap since August—Clinton had a 9-point lead among all registered voters—but concedes the GOP nominee  still needs to push this campaign closer.  NBC notes Trump could get some help from voter indications that they're still looking for a shakeup in the White House: The poll found 49% want a president who would bring  major changes,  even if those changes aren't predictable, while 47% favor a more  steady approach.  Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight advises Clinton fans not to get too excited, noting that its own, more-sophisticated polling model shows she can't quite claim a rebound yet.","As Debate Nears, Clinton Leads by 6 Points","As Debate Nears, Clinton Leads by ____ Points",6,Copy( 6 ),0

It was originally scheduled for 9pm, then the nearly sold-out audience was told the start time had been pushed back to 10:30pm.

The recent operation broke up two trafficking rings and led to the arrests of the ring leaders. The national operation was set up earlier this year after local police spotted trafficking signs, including frequent appearances of out-of-town pregnant women, in a clinic in north China's Hebei province. State media reported that parents wishing to sell their babies could find potential buyers through the clinic. One of its doctors was among those arrested. Trafficking in children is a big problem in China. Its strict one-child policy—which limits most urban couples to one child and rural couples to two if their first-born is a girl—has driven a thriving market in babies, especially boys because of a traditional preference for male heirs. Many trafficked babies are abducted, but some are sold by families who are too poor to care for a baby or do not want a girl. State media report that a baby girl can fetch $4,800 to $8,000 and that a baby boy sells for $11,200 to $12,800.",802 Busted in Chinese Child Trafficking Rings,____ Busted in Chinese Child Trafficking Rings,802,Copy( 802 ),0

This is a group that essentially subscribes to an anti-Semitic, racist ideology, and then organizes, trains, and deploys to various political rallies, not only to espouse this particular ideology but also to engage in acts of violence against folks who are taking a contrary point of view,  US Attorney Thomas Cullen said at a news conference in Charlottesville held to announce the charges. Cullen said investigators sifted through  an incredible volume  of video and still photographs and found there was  no provocation  for the men to engage in violence against counterprotesters; they made their way to the rally with their hands taped,  ready to do street battle,  he said. Then they engaged in punching, kicking, head-butting, and pushing, assaulting an African-American man, two women, and a minister who was wearing a clerical collar, Cullen said.

"(Jul 9, 2020  8:32 AM CDT) New unemployment claims are out, and they're a smidge better than expected, reports CNBC. As in, 1.31 million people applied for jobless benefits last week, compared with the expected figure of 1.39 million. The AP has some coronavirus context: This marks the 16th straight week the figure has topped 1 million, and prior to the outbreak, the record for weekly applications was about 700,000. That the figure has  plateaued  at these levels—after peaking at 6.9 million in March—shows that  many Americans are still losing their jobs amid a broadly healing labor market,  per the Wall Street Journal. The Labor Department also said the total number of people receiving unemployment benefits fell by 700,000 to 18 million.  We still have a long road ahead of us,  Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab tells CNBC.  These are definitely good numbers, but this is going to be a long and bumpy road.  That the total number of people receiving benefits dropped is a sign that some employers are rehiring workers, though the outlook is spotty because of COVID-19. The new figures came out as six states—Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, and Texas—reversed plans to reopen businesses, and these states alone make up one-third of the economy, notes the AP.

But instead of stick figures, Iris Grace immersed herself in abstract impressionist painting for hours at a time, often depicting movement in nature such as water, trees, wind, birds, and of course her cat, Thula. Now 5, Iris Grace is already selling her paintings for thousands of dollars a print, with art collectors and galleries gushing over the vibrancy and openness of her work, reports the Independent.  She is so interested in movement and how it changes things,  her mother tells the paper, noting her daughter has received  a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style.  It all started simply enough, with her parents opting to share their daughter's early works online. Now Iris Grace has more than 95,000 likes on Facebook, and the proceeds from her art help fund her art supplies and private therapy for her disorder, which made it difficult for her to speak until recently. Meanwhile, her mother tells ABC News they have to shield their daughter from all the attention and keep her schedule as stable and routine as possible.  Nothing has changed in Iris' world,  notes her mom.

"(Jan 7, 2014  8:31 AM) Run Run Shaw might not be a household name, but these are: Chow Yun-fat and John Woo, who got their starts at his studio, and Quentin Tarantino, who was one of many filmmakers inspired by him. Shaw, the Hong Kong producer who is considered the father of the kung fu movie genre, died today at home in Hong Kong, aged 106. Shaw was born Shao Yifu;  Run Run  was a nickname. He and his older brother, the similarly-nicknamed Run Me, made their first film in 1924. By 1927, they had moved to Singapore and were producing movies as well as importing others to play in their theaters, the New York Times reports. After World War II, Run Run ended up in Hong Kong, where, by the late 1960s, he was enjoying great success making modern martial arts movies including Five Fingers of Death and Shaolin Avenger. The Shaw Bros. studio was the largest in Asia at that time, and produced the region's most popular films, the Los Angeles Times reports.  We were like the Hollywood of the 1930s,  Shaw once said; he had created Shaw Movietown, a huge complex where his employees both lived and worked.  We controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution and the exhibition.  But he lost out on one very big name: Bruce Lee. Lee wanted $10,000 per movie and a long-term contract, which Shaw rejected; a competing company, founded by a former Shaw employee, ended up backing Lee instead. But Shaw's success continued: In addition to the nearly 1,000 films his companies released, he eventually expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and more—he became one of Macy's biggest shareholders in the 1990s, to help save it from bankruptcy—and even co-produced US movies including Blade Runner. He was also a generous philanthropist who was eventually knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

The attackers and at least five Afghans were killed, officials said. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility. It was the largest clash at the Jalalabad air base since February, when a suicide car bombing at the gate killed nine Afghans. Two vehicles packed with explosives barreled toward the base's main gate around 6am local time. The first vehicle blew up at the gate, said a provincial police spokesman. Guards started shooting at the second vehicle before it too exploded, he added. Two Afghan students were caught up in the attack and killed, as were three other Afghans working at the base. Nine attackers took part in the assault in total, three of whom were killed in the suicide blasts and another six gunmen who died in the ensuing fighting that lasted a few hours.

"(May 27, 2020  1:09 PM CDT) In the 1980s, playwright and fiercely confrontational AIDS activist Larry Kramer slammed Dr. Anthony Fauci as a murderer and an  incompetent idiot  for failing to move fast enough on research. But the two later became friends, with Fauci crediting Kramer, who died Wednesday morning, with playing a key role in the development of drug treatments that could help people with HIV live longer lives. Kramer's husband, David Webster, says the 84-year-old died from pneumonia, the New York Times reports. Kramer was an outspoken advocate for AIDS research starting in the early '80s, when the disease was being called the  gay plague,  reports the Washington Post. He founded the Gay Men’s Health Crisis group in New York in 1982, followed by the more radical ACT UP in 1987. ACT UP fought to raise awareness with stunts like shutting down the New York Stock Exchange and covering the house of conservative Sen. Jesse Helms in a giant condom. Susan Sontag once called Kramer  one of America's most valuable troublemakers,  and Kramer, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1988, acknowledged that  we’re not here to make friends, we’re here to raise the issues.  His largely autobiographical play The Normal Heart, which looked at the early days of the AIDS crisis in New York, won awards on Broadway and became an Emmy-winning TV drama. In March he started work on a play about gay men living through the  three plagues  of AIDS, aging, and COVID-19.  The government has been awful in both cases,  he told the Times.

"(Sep 20, 2010  10:06 AM CDT) A lot of unemployed Americans over 50 are getting the unhappy sense that they may as well kiss the workforce goodbye—nobody is going to hire them again. Blame the fact that the recovery is so sluggish. At the current rate it will take as long as 8 years for the nearly 15 million jobless to get reabsorbed, and with younger people looking more attractive to employers, older folks are likely to age out before their turn comes. This is not only harsh news to those who desperately need to work, but ironic since the recession, by destroying nest eggs and the value of their homes, also increased the need to keep working past retirement age. The average time those 55 and older have been out of work was slightly more than 39 weeks in August, the longest of any age group. Another small irony: The longer you're out of work, the more prospective employers wonder why you've been out of work so long, an AARP spokesman tells the New York Times.",Over-50 Jobless May Be Out of Work for Good,Over-____ Jobless May Be Out of Work for Good,50,Copy( 50 ),0

Officials and other insiders say the US held onto the cash until a Swiss Air Force plane left Iran with the freed Americans. Only then was an Iranian cargo plane with the cash allowed to take off. One official says that Iranian officials in Switzerland were allowed to take custody of the money only when the other plane was  wheels up  on its way to Geneva. The administration says the payment was part of a $1.7 billion settlement over a failed 1979 arms deal and that the other $1.3 billion has now been paid. One of the released prisoners, pastor Saeed Abedini, tells the Journal that the prisoners were kept waiting overnight for what Iranian authorities told them was the movement of another airplane, though administration officials say the plane was delayed because they were searching for the wife and mother of Jason Rezaian, another released prisoner.

She doesn't appear in the footage, but was one of 1,004 people—996 of them between the ages of 15 and 24—notified Monday that they face preliminary charges for sharing child porn. The New York Times delves into the case, which involves video taken of two consenting Danish 15-year-olds having sex. The sex part is legal in the country. but sharing the videos runs afoul of Denmark's child-porn laws. The videos were disseminated via Facebook's Messenger app; Facebook deleted them in the fall upon learning about them and reported them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which alerted Europol and Danish police, NBC News reports. After months spent tracking social media accounts and IP addresses, Danish police made their move in what Bloomberg calls the  biggest case of its kind  in the country. Prosecutors will make the call on whether to move forward with the charges, and the Times predicts that if they do, it's unlikely anyone will end up in prison. But the paper notes that getting off scot-free could be tough: A conviction would make getting certain jobs (with law enforcement, or working with children) impossible, and even if they were to successfully argue they thought the couple was at least 18, they could be hit with a charge for sharing the video without consent.

Saudi Arabia's King Salman is visiting Cairo, and Egypt has agreed to hand two small but strategic islands over to his country, the New York Times reports. The country's Cabinet announced on Saturday that it had agreed to give up control of Sanafir and Tiran, two largely uninhabited islands at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Tiran, the larger of the two, is roughly the size of Manhattan. Saudi Arabia gave the islands to Egypt in 1950 amid fears that Israel might seize them, but while Egyptian officials claim the territory is simply being returned, the announcement caused a public outcry in Egypt and at least five people were arrested during a demonstration in Cairo, the AP reports. The deal still needs to be approved by Egypt's Parliament. Authorities say it follows 11 rounds of negotiation since 2010, reports the Wall Street Journal. Critics, however, say it looks as if Egypt is selling its land to the wealthier country, especially since Salman announced a new $16 billion investment fund during a speech to Egyptian lawmakers. Al Jazeera reports that the king's visit also yielded an agreement to build a bridge over the sea to connect the two countries. It's not clear where it will be built, though it would involve Tiran island if it's built where the countries are closest.

Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Tuesday that she will personally deliver the check to the Ministry of Public Service, along with the other women in her government, NPR reports.

So yes, to promote and one day achieve parity, we must speed up the tempo and ensure that in the nominations there are more women than men.

Philip Chism was 14 when he followed his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, into a school bathroom, strangled her, stabbed her at least 16 times, and raped her. During his trial, his lawyer admitted Chism killed Ritzer, but said he was suffering from severe mental illness and was not criminally responsible for his actions. A psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Chism was hearing voices and in the throes of a psychotic episode when he killed Ritzer. Ritzer, 24, was a popular teacher at Danvers High School, about 25 miles north of Boston, doing her dream job, teaching math, Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall told jurors in her opening statement. On Oct. 22, 2013, Ritzer asked Chism to stay after school. Another student who also stayed late testified that Ritzer tried to engage Chism—who had recently moved to Massachusetts—in light talk about his new community. The student said Chism became visibly upset and Ritzer changed the subject. A short time later, Ritzer left the classroom. Jurors were shown chilling surveillance video that showed Chism seconds later poking his head out of her classroom and looking down the hall. He then goes back into the classroom, but comes right back out with his hood on. Chism is then shown putting on a pair of gloves as he walks into the bathroom. Minutes later, he is shown emerging from the bathroom carrying the black pants Ritzer was wearing. Chism, now 16, was tried as an adult.

"(Jan 17, 2013  2:18 PM) Concerned that you may not be getting your money's worth when you buy a  $5 Footlong  at Subway? Have no fear: The New York Post is on it. In a stunning exposé, the newspaper has uncovered that some Subway outlets in New York are serving up  footlongs  that are only 11 to 11.5 inches. The Post was first alerted to the problem by an observant eater whose picture of a sandwich next to a tape measure went viral earlier this week, and the newspaper carried out its own investigation into the matter. Four out of seven so-called  footlongs  purchased in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens came up short. Some have speculated that subs end up shorter when they're toasted, but the Post found no evidence of that. The newspaper also learned that cold-cut portion sizes have been cut by 25% recently, thanks to increased food costs, according to a franchise owner. Needless to say, some customers the Post spoke to were none too pleased:  They're cheating us!  says a guy who eats at Subway every other day. (The newspaper points out that, after a year of his eating habits, the lost inch per sandwich will end up  costing  him $100.) But others remained unfazed:  It’s probably good that it’s not a whole foot long—I don’t think anybody needs a full foot-long sandwich,  says another customer.",Scandal: Some Subway 'Footlongs' Just 11 Inches,Scandal: Some Subway 'Footlongs' Just ____ Inches,11,Copy( 11 ),0

To show their loyalty, workers are putting in extra hours to boost production in everything from coal mining to work in fisheries. Bright red flags and propaganda posters have gone up around the country to emphasize the importance of meeting or exceeding production targets, the AP reports.  Our work has become more difficult than usual,  says Nam Myong Hu, who supervises operations of a 5,000-ton refrigerator at the Sinpho Fishery.  There is no distinction between the start and end time of work, and we sleep at the workplace.  The loyalty campaign was called to rally the nation ahead of a major ruling party congress scheduled for May. Kim is expected to use the congress to showcase his achievements and power—and potentially announce a road map for the country's future political and economic strategies. The campaign comes as North Korea is under heavy pressure from the outside world over its recent nuclear test and rocket launches. According to a recent editorial in the ruling party newspaper, the campaign is aimed at  combating indolence and slackness and making a clean sweep of outdated ideological hangovers such as flunkeyism, experientialism, self-protection, and conservatism.

The Caldwell County Sheriff's Office says human remains found Tuesday in a 1968 Pontiac recovered from a Lake Rhodhiss, 75 miles northwest of Charlotte, could help solve the case of Amos Shook, who was reported missing on Feb. 19, 1972. Officials say the car, found in 30 feet of water using advanced sonar, matches the model that belonged to Shook, who was 44 when he disappeared. A sheriff's rep won't say what led investigators to the lake, but adds that there were no initial signs of foul play. The Charlotte Observer reports that the search for Shook, who had retired from the US Air Force and was living in the town of Sawmills, was resumed after his daughter approached police last month with a newspaper article about her missing father and asked them to search again.  Unless the medical examiner says the autopsy shows some type of foul play, we may never know what happened,  an officer says.

It's a staggering number, if you think about it,  says the lead author.  Basically there's one of these planets per star.  The researchers figured the estimate by studying Kepler-32, a five-planet system that, they say, is representative of many such systems in the galaxy, Space.com reports. The planets orbit around the most common type of star in the galaxy, and they are similar in size and orbit pattern to other planets spotted orbiting around the same type of star.  This is as close to a Rosetta stone as anything I've seen,  says a co-author.  It's like unlocking a language that we're trying to understand—the language of planet formation.

Three senators are saying the same, and they've just put forth a  big idea  to deal with the issue, per Politico. On Friday, Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Ed Markey unveiled the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act, which would give a monthly $2,000 check to each American who makes less than $120,000 a year. Married couples filing jointly would get a total of $4,000, while each child (up to three of them per family) would bring in $2,000. The payments would be retroactive to March and would continue until three months after the virus emergency is officially declared over by Health and Human Services.  Congress [has] a responsibility to make sure that people aren't left behind,  a release from Harris says.  Every US resident  would receive a payment, even if they don't have a Social Security number or didn't file taxes last year. Debt collectors would also be forbidden from taking the payments. Forbes notes that it's tough to see the billing passing as is, given that it would give a family of four $8,000 a month. That translates to $96,000 a year, above the median income of $62,000 in 2018. The bill is also competing for funds with similar ones in the works; the magazine notes that  while it is possible an additional stimulus bill may be passed, we will likely see major revisions that would reduce [the] total expenditure of this or other proposals.",Senators' Proposal: Americans Should Get $2K a Month,Senators' Proposal: Americans Should Get $____K a Month,2,"Paraphrase( 2,000 , K )",1

A 2008 settlement agreement dictates that  the doors and windows of the establishment will remain closed from 12:30am until closing when live music is being played,  but on June 22, 2014, the report states, an inspector noticed that a live band was playing  directly in front of one of the establishment’s ground floor windows  while said window was open.  He opened the window to let [a] fart out,  says the owner of the bar.  He cracked it open for five minutes, then the inspector showed up. Twenty f---ing years with not one violation and this is what they came up with. People get stabbed and shot in these other establishments.

Seven men were given life sentences—three of those received multiple life sentences, notes the AP—while another two teenagers were sentenced to lesser terms of at least 20 years each. The convictions stemmed from multiple incidents this year and last year. The verdict was greeted with shouts of  injustice!  from the defendants, adds Reuters, while one victim cried in relief and victims' rights advocates cheered the crackdown.  This verdict is pure justice and the least that those people can get for the crimes they committed,  said one victim's lawyer. The problem—which rose to global prominence when video went viral of a naked victim at a mass rally last month for new President Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi—had reached endemic levels: 250 assaults had been documented in Tahrir Square since 2011, with zero resulting in investigations until al-Sisi was forced to take action in the wake of public outcry.

Programs affected include $300 million to help Pakistan deploy 100,000 troops along the Afghanistan border, as well as training in radios, night-vision goggles, and helicopter spare parts. Some of the US cutbacks are designed to push greater anti-terrorism efforts, while others are in response to Pakistan denying visas to Americans needed to operate the related equipment. The cuts, although they have not been revealed to the Pakistani public, are well known to senior military officials, as the US attempts to get leverage over Pakistan. The cuts do not affect non-military aid or the sale of military equipment, such as F-16 jets.

Politico notes that the tweet failed to mention that the AP's analysis of Clinton meetings looked only at discretionary meetings and not meetings with federal officials or representatives of foreign governments, which tend to make up the majority of any secretary of state's meetings.

Some Wall Street analysts complain that Google is quickly becoming too bloated, but the search king disagrees.

Even with the new workers, Google's 31,000 employs would lag far behind Microsoft's 88,400. And there is no telling how many of the new jobs will be based in the United States.

A police sting caught Weinstein admitting on tape that he grabbed an Italian model's breasts. But after a stable of well-connected Weinstein lawyers and handlers mobilized to discredit Ambra Battilana, 22, the case was dropped within two weeks in April 2015. Prosecutors, including current New York City DA Cyrus Vance, decided Battilana wasn't a credible witness because she disavowed statements she made in Italy related to a sex harassment claim, as well as a sex party thrown by former PM Silvio Berlusconi. Weinstein's lawyers said he touched Battilana's breasts to determine if they were real for a lingerie ad. Prosecutors decided the allegations weren't strong enough. The police disagree.  We brought them a very good case,  a senior NYPD official tells the Times. After the case was dropped, the Times says  Weinstein silenced Ms. Battilana with a substantial payment,  though she says she then watched her fashion career fizzle. Meanwhile, the NYPD said on Sunday they were probing new allegations against Weinstein. And in London, cops said a third accuser stepped forward accusing Weinstein, 65, of sexually assaulting her three times between 2010 and 2015, the Telegraph reports.

With pristine muscle, skin, and fur, the complete mummified wolf pup, believed to have died around eight weeks old, looks as though it's resting. In a sense, it had been until it was unearthed in Yukon, Canada, in the summer of 2016. It was actually the second such discovery by gold miners near Dawson City. A month earlier, on property owned by Gold Rush star Tony Beets, the well-preserved front half of a caribou calf was discovered in an area home to an 80,000-year-old ash bed, left behind from ice age volcanoes. With both specimens carbon-dated to more than 50,000 years ago,  we think this is some of the oldest mummified soft tissue in the entire world,  Zazula tells the CBC. The  spectacular  pup is also thought to be the only mummified ice age wolf ever found, according to a release.  It's got the cute little paws and tail and the curled upper lip showing its teeth,  Zazula tells the Canadian Press.  Once in a while we find remains of ice-age voles or squirrels,  he adds.  This is very, very rare.  Looking for clues about the animals' diets and ancient environment, researchers plan to do genetic testing on the  world-class  specimens, which have  garnered a great deal of international scientific interest,  per the release.

Christopher Plaskon, 18, accepted a plea bargain during a brief appearance in Milford Superior Court, the AP reports. Sentencing is set for June 6. Plaskon was charged with killing 16-year-old Maren Sanchez at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25, 2014. His family and friends said he became upset that Sanchez turned down his prom invitation. Plaskon was held at a psychiatric hospital after the stabbing. His attorneys were considering an insanity defense. Plaskon lawyer Edward Garvin said his client suffered from psychosis and called the claim that the stabbing was over a prom rejection  inaccurate.  State's Attorney Kevin Lawlor, however, said evidence from several sources pointed to the rejection as the reason for the attack. Garvin said state law would allow Plaskon to apply for parole in 13 years, based on the fact that he was 16 at the time of the killing. Lawlor said the plea bargain was the best result possible in the case.

Slate and Salon are featuring excerpts from a new biography of Lewin by Molly Knight Raskin. He was born in Denver, but moved to Israel with his family at age 14, where he attended a technology school and later signed up for the Israeli Defense Force, serving as a commando in an elite counterterrorism unit. He eventually ended up at MIT on a full scholarship, and while there he wrote algorithms to make web content delivery quicker and more efficient.  MIT has a lot of really smart people, and Danny stood out even among that rarified environment,  one of his professors tells CNN. Based on those algorithms, Lewin and that professor founded software company Akamai; he was taking American Airlines Flight 11 to a business meeting on September 11. After the hijacking began, Lewin, 31—who Raskin suggests could have suspected something was amiss before anyone else, because of his IDF training and knowledge of conversational Arabic—got up and struggled with one of the terrorists. Per a 9/11 Commission report issued four years after the attack and based largely on the info two flight attendants relayed to authorities, Satam al-Suqami most likely killed Lewin from behind, by slashing his throat. He died between 8:15am and 8:20am, and the plane slammed into the World Trade Center at 8:46am.  He was the first victim of the first war of the 21st century,  says Lewin's best friend. Akamai, now a multibillion-dollar business, was struggling on September 11—but, Raskin notes, most major news sites managed to stay up and running amid the avalanche of traffic that day because of it.

While the globe is littered with pieces of territory jealously held or fought over for historical reasons, the two neighboring nations signed away tiny plots of their land to the other because they were too much of a practical and jurisdictional bother, the AP reports. When it comes to size, Belgium is the loser, as it will shed a peninsula, rich with birdlife and flora, jutting into the Meuse River that divides the nations. On the flip side, it will lose a jurisdictional nightmare that developed over time as the river meandered to turn the portion of Belgium's land—about 15 soccer fields' worth—into a plot attached only to the Netherlands. The portion the Netherlands gives up, part of the river's lock system, is far smaller. Even though the two are close neighbors with friendly relations, it still took several years to get through legal complications. The Belgian part linked to the Netherlands especially started to pose some problems, as it was rumored to be a haven for drug dealers and sexual escapades. About four years ago, passers-by stumbled onto a headless body—but the Dutch couldn't go there because it was Belgian territory, and Belgian police and judicial authorities found it tough to get there: They're not allowed to cross into the Netherlands without special permission, and the peninsula had no proper landing zone for boats or equipment arriving by water.

"(Dec 2, 2011  12:02 AM) The Senate last night overwhelmingly passed a massive $662 billion defense bill that calls for crippling sanctions against Iran, requires the military to hold suspected terrorists—even those busted on US soil—and would allow detention of American citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely without trial. The White House has threatened to veto the bill because of the ramp-up in the military role in handling terrorists.  Applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the US would raise serious legal questions, and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets,  the White House said in a statement. The bill would require military custody of suspects linked to al-Qaeda or its affiliates and involved in an attack or a plot against the US. American citizens would be exempt. But the legislation also would allow authorities to deny suspected terrorists, even citizens seized in the US, the right to trial and subject them to indefinite detention, reports AP. The provision infuriates civil rights groups.  Since the bill puts military detention authority on steroids and makes it permanent, American citizens are at greater risk of being locked away by the military without charge or trial if this bill becomes law,  said the senior legislative counsel for the ACLU.

The voracious grass carp is among four Asian carp species threatening to reach the world's largest surface freshwater system, the AP reports. Grass carp have been found in Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario, although it's uncertain how many there are or how widely they have spread, US and Canadian researchers said. At least some are reproducing. A spokesperson for the Great Lakes Fisher Commission says the risk to the Great Lakes is  pretty substantial.  Grass carp were introduced to the US in the early 1960s to control weed growth in waterways. Some escaped into the Mississippi River and have migrated northward toward the Great Lakes. They've been turning up more often in recent years, and the threat of a full-fledged invasion appears to be rising. The analysis said it is  very likely  that grass carp will become established in Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario within 10 years unless effective steps are taken to stop them. Researchers are studying how to prevent that.

"(May 31, 2017  6:34 PM CDT) The Ohio attorney general sued five drugmakers on Wednesday, accusing the companies of perpetrating the state's addictions epidemic by intentionally misleading patients about the dangers of painkillers and promoting benefits of the drugs not backed by science. Attorney General Mike DeWine said the companies created a deadly mess in Ohio that they now need to pay to clean up.  This lawsuit is about justice, it's about fairness, it's about what is right,  DeWine said in announcing the complaint filed in Ross County, a southern Ohio community slammed by fatal drug overdoses from painkillers and heroin. A record 3,050 Ohioans died from drug overdoses in 2015, a figure expected to jump sharply once 2016 figures are tallied, reports the AP. DeWine wants an injunction stopping the companies from their alleged misconduct and damages for money the state spent on opiates sold and marketed in Ohio. The attorney general also wants customers repaid for unnecessary opiate prescriptions for chronic pain.  These drug companies knew that what they were doing was wrong and they did it anyway,  DeWine said. The drugmakers sued by DeWine are Purdue Pharma; Endo Health Solutions; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and its subsidiary, Cephalon; Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals; and Allergan. They variously manufacture OxyContin, Percocet, and a host of other painkillers that DeWine said represent the heart of the problem. Other states have filed similar lawsuits; in 2015, Kentucky settled a suit with Purdue Pharma for $24 million.","Ohio Sues 5 Drugmakers, Says They Caused Deadly Mess","Ohio Sues ____ Drugmakers, Says They Caused Deadly Mess",5,Trans( five ),1

The federal indictments and plea deal were announced Wednesday by the Justice Department in Washington involving the pollution violation and an elaborate and wide-ranging scheme to cover it up. It's the largest penalty ever levied by the government against an automaker. The deal also requires VW to cooperate in an ongoing probe that could lead to the arrest of more employees. At a press conference Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said  Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied.  VW installed software into diesel engines on some vehicles that allowed the engines to turn on pollution controls during government tests and switch them off in real-world driving. The software, called a  defeat device  because it defeated the emissions controls, improved engine performance but spewed out harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times above the legal limit. Regulators confronted VW employees about the use of the software in the summer of 2015. Volkswagen at first denied using the defeat device, but finally admitted to it in September of that year.

One of the events was a wedding attended by 91 people on Oct. 17, though the state limits gatherings to 50 people, reports the New York Times. Now, 27 guests, two venue employees, and a vendor have tested positive, and 156 people are in quarantine after possible exposure, Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said at a Wednesday news conference, per the Washington Post. Cutchogue's North Fork Country Club has been fined $17,000 for violating that 50-person cap, per CNN.  This kind of blatant disregard for the well-being of others is not only extremely disappointing; it will not be tolerated,  Bellone said. On the same day as the wedding, some 50 people attended a birthday party in Bellport. It was in compliance with the rules, but 26 guests later tested positive; another 132 people are in quarantine, Bellone said.

Chris Daniels, who leads encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, will also depart Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in a post announcing the news Thursday. It isn't clear what future plans the executives have, the AP reports. Zuckerberg wrote that Cox considered leaving years ago to pursue new projects, but he decided to stay in 2016, around the time Facebook began taking heat for acting as a conduit for misinformation and Russian election interference. Zuckerberg phrased that more delicately, noting that  We both realized we had too much important work to do to improve our products for society.  Cox joined 13 years ago and helped create Facebook's News Feed feature. Less than a year ago, he was put in charge of all of Facebook's apps, including its flagship social media site as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Reversing course, Facebook will not appoint a direct replacement for Cox. Instead, the leaders of each app will report to Zuckerberg. The news of Cox's departure comes a week after Zuckerberg announced a new  privacy-focused  mission for Facebook that will emphasize private messaging over public sharing. Many of the changes Zuckerberg outlined involve duplicating some of WhatsApp's features in Facebook's other messaging apps. Daniels has been at Facebook nearly nine years, and previously led the company's Internet.org effort, a project aimed at bringing internet access to developing countries.

"(Sep 7, 2015  3:51 AM CDT) Showing solidarity with workers on Labor Day, President Barack Obama will sign an executive order today requiring paid sick leave for employees of federal contractors, including 300,000 who currently receive none. The White House wouldn't specify the cost to federal contractors to implement the executive order, which Obama will address at a major union rally and breakfast in Boston. The Labor Department says any costs would be offset by savings that contractors would see as a result of lower attrition rates and increased worker loyalty. Under the order, employees working on federal contracts gain the right to a minimum of one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours they work. Stretched out over 12 months, that's up to seven days per year. The order will allow employees to use the leave to care for sick relatives as well, and will affect contracts starting in 2017—just as Obama leaves office. The Obama administration has been working on the executive order for months, and chose Labor Day to announce it as Obama works to enact what policies he can before his presidency ends despite resistance in Congress to laws he's proposed to improve workplace conditions. Roughly 44 million private sector workers don't get paid sick leave—about 40% of the private-sector workforce, the White House says.

At the largest firms, overall compensation is estimated to be up 31% to more than $340,000, and an analysis of the bonuses leads authorities to believe Wall Street profits may reach $55 billion for 2009, almost 3 times the previous record. State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli calls it  unprecedented.  The record profit would, of course, follow a disastrous $42.6 billion loss in 2008, CNNMoney notes. And though the 2009 bonus pool is much improved over that year, it comes nowhere near its previous highs.

"(Jan 31, 2015  2:16 PM) The sewage being treated by your city could be a veritable gold mine. That's because all kinds of metals end up in sewage sludge, which is the leftovers from treated sewage, Science reports. Researchers in Arizona recently found that a city of a million people could generate up to $13 million a year in such metals, with $2.6 million of that coming in the form of gold and silver. They studied the samples, which came from 32 states, with a mass spectrometer, Discover reports; the tool uses extreme heat to reveal elements. On a global scale, they found, sludge probably contains about 360 tons of gold each year.  While we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising,  a study co-author tells Time. Getting at those metals might sound like a pipe dream, quite literally, but a city in Japan was able to get about four pounds of gold from every metric ton of ash from burned sludge. That's better than what some mines can offer, Science notes.  We need to make this push where we stop thinking about (sewage sludge) as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource,  says an outside researcher. Unfortunately, there's not currently any technology to extract metals from sludge on a large scale, but if we could someday find a way to do so, there could be environmental benefits, too: The metals in sludge, which is often used as fertilizer, may not be great for the environment, so removing them could be a good thing.

More than 400 such crimes—dozens of them alleged child molestations—were barely investigated or completely uninvestigated after being reported to Arpaio's office during a three-year period that ended in 2007, the AP reports. In El Mirage, where Arpaio's office provided contract police services, many of those cases involved illegal immigrants; one former police chief believes whoever made the call not to pursue the cases knew that most illegal immigrants would not complain about the quality of the police work.

It was all in a day's work for the 6'6  legendary zoologist, who was suffering a heart ailment when he died Wednesday at his home in Rowayton, Conn., his son confirms to the Los Angeles Times. Fowler's legacy, at least in part, is a wealth of knowledge shared with millions of Americans as co-host of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom beginning in 1963 and as a guest on more than 100 episodes of the Tonight Show. Whether rescuing a puma from floodwaters or tracking polar bears, he  was trying to create some hope and interest in the next generation about what they can do to participate in preserving the natural world,  fellow wildlife expert Peter Gros tells the Times. Born in Albany, Ga., in 1930, Fowler grew up training birds of prey on a 680-acre farm he later converted to a wildlife preserve. A talented athlete, he also fielded offers from the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies, but ultimately decided to study zoology. Fowler eventually traveled to all seven continents, becoming the first man to trap a harpy eagle and bring it alive to the US, per the Hollywood Reporter.  I learned that if you're gonna fool around with [animals], you better know what the danger points are,  Fowler told Connecticut Magazine in 2015, pointing out the little-known fact that anacondas will  wrap you tail-first.

Shots were fired around 11:45pm Tuesday during a confrontation between protesters and armed men who claimed to be protecting a gas station, reports the New York Times. After initial shots, a graphic video showed a white man with a rifle running away from a crowd, falling, then firing multiple shots into the crowd.

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, at a forum in Seoul, compared Kim Jong Un's alleged 70 executions with those of his late father, Kim Jong Il, who Yun said executed about 10 officials in his first years. An official from South Korea's National Intelligence Service confirmed that the spy agency believes the younger Kim has executed about 70 but wouldn't reveal how it obtained the information. Yun said Kim's  reign of terror affects significantly  North Koreans working overseas by inspiring them to defect to the South, but also didn't reveal how he got the details. Information about North Korea's inner workings is often impossible to confirm, but high-level purges have a long history. To strengthen power, Kim Jong Un's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, removed pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factions in the senior leadership in the years after the Korean War. Kim Jong Un has also removed key members of the old guard through a series of purges; The most spectacular to date was the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason.

Pell—Australia's most senior Catholic and, as Vatican treasurer, the church's No. 3 official worldwide—formally pleaded not guilty to the charges at a hearing in Melbourne Tuesday, the BBC reports. Around half of the historical charges, including the ones Pell's attorney described as the most  vile,  were dismissed, but Pell will stand trial on charges relating to alleged sexual offenses in a pool in the town of Ballarat in the 1970s, and at Melbourne's St. Patrick's Cathedral when he was the city's archbishop in the 1990s, Radio Australia reports. More than 30 witnesses testified during a pretrial hearing that lasted for four weeks. Magistrate Belinda Wallington said some of the charges were dismissed because of inconsistencies and a lack of evidence; others were dismissed because one accuser died and another was found medically unfit to give evidence. Pell, 76, took a leave of absence from Rome last year to return to Australia and face the charges. His passport has now been confiscated by authorities.

He's  the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped,  says a rep for the Seoul-based Abductees' Family Union, per the Daily Mail. And he's one of thousands of fishermen believed to have been taken by the North across decades, though Pyongyang denies it. Some 450 have never returned home, reports the New York Times. The escape, first reported last month, is rare; the Times reports that eight fisherman are previously said to have made it back since 2000. And the ordeal doesn't necessarily end upon reaching home: According to the Mail, South Korean officials are typically suspicious of escapees like Chun, fearing they could have been indoctrinated by the North and set free as a spy. They may also be concerned that the person claiming to be Chun could in fact be a North Korean agent. Chun was reportedly questioned for two weeks upon his arrival in the South before rejoining his family.

Darryl Wright, a former Idaho National Guardsman, appeared for sentencing Thursday in US District Court, where Judge Benjamin Settle said he wanted to hear additional testimony about Wright's mental health before issuing a punishment. Prosecutors are seeking a five-year prison term, arguing that Wright falsified statements from fellow soldiers to obtain two awards—a Combat Action Badge and the Purple Heart—and then parlayed those medals into a wide range of disability and other benefits, including forgiveness of more than $40,000 in student loans. In applications for benefits, Wright claimed to be so severely disabled that he could only focus his attention for five to 10 seconds, and he said he needed a live-in caregiver. In reality, he served as chairman of his city's planning commission, coached high school basketball, and had held a full-time federal government job in Seattle. Wright claimed Social Security disability benefits, insisting he was frequently bedridden.

Authorities had long tried (and failed) to track Song down, but their first big break came in early September, when tips came in on the WeChat social media app on Song's general whereabouts. Ground searches in the mountains in back of his hometown turned up nothing, which is when drones were deployed to help—and success was soon had, when one of the drones spotted a blue steel tile on top of a cliff, with what looked like garbage outside the mouth of a small cave.

"(Jul 16, 2015  10:11 AM CDT) Another year, another controversial TLC show gets the boot. After pulling episodes of 19 Kids and Counting, TLC confirms it has canceled its most-watched show after claims that cast member Josh Duggar molested four of his sisters and a babysitter as a teen. 19 Kids  will no longer appear on the air  after 10 seasons, the network tells the AP, calling the move  the best way forward.  TLC says it will kick off a campaign to raise awareness about child sex abuse, to begin with a commercial-free documentary featuring Duggar sisters Jill Dillard and Jessa Seewald in August.  They're interested in putting the focus on this issue, too,  a TLC rep says of the Duggar family. Seewald and Dillard came forward as victims last month in an interview with Fox News. Josh Duggar hasn't admitted to the molestation claims but vaguely apologized back in May for acting  inexcusably ; he has never been charged.  We are so thankful for our film crew that has shown up at our house for over a decade,  the Duggar family says in a statement, per the Washington Post.  They have become like family to us.

And the stats don't get rosier from there: 38% said they had fallen asleep by accident during the day in the last month, and close to 5% nodded off while driving, reports the LA Times.  Sleep difficulties, some of which are preventable, are associated with chronic diseases, mental disorders, health-risk behaviors, limitations of daily functioning, injury and mortality,  says the report.  Drowsy driving, one of the most lethal consequences of inadequate sleep, has been responsible for an estimated 1,550 fatalities and 40,000 nonfatal injuries annually in the United States,  wrote the report. The survey also revealed that nearly half of Americans snore; that people who are unable to work are much more likely to get less than 7 hours of sleep compared to employed people; and people who are divorced or single tend to be slightly more likely to get less sleep than their married counterparts.

"(Oct 9, 2012  1:58 PM CDT) Want to know what's wrong with the corporate publishing industry? Take a look at Lena Dunham's insane book deal, which Rob Spillman pegs at $3.7 million on Salon. Random House will need to sell at least 500,000 copies to break even, which Spillman thinks is a long shot. But even if the company pulls it off,  is this any way to run a publishing company?  Spillman wonders.  Put aside the cultural impact question for a second. The whole approach seems short-sighted at best.  Imagine if Random House had taken that $3.7 million and instead given $10,000 advances to 370 writers—or even $100,000 advances to 37 writers. Surely a few of the resulting books would have been better and more successful than Dunham's book, and a few of the writers would have outsold her over time. But  this argument presumes time. Which is what corporate publishers don’t have,  Spillman explains.  They have shareholders, and/or parent companies, and must justify their quarterly earnings.  That's why small publishers are increasingly winning the big literary awards after taking chances on books that the major houses won't touch.  Random House’s rash deal with Dunham is … why the corporate publishers are losing cultural relevance, and why they might soon lose solvency as well.

"(May 6, 2014  6:24 PM CDT) Is college still a good investment despite the soaring cost of tuition? Most definitely, concludes a new report by the San Francisco Fed. It found that most of those who graduate with a four-year degree can expect to earn about $831,000 more by retirement age than those who skip college. That includes the cost of tuition and four years of missed wages while getting the diploma, notes Reuters. Researchers found that after 10 years in the work force, graduates in the 1990s-2000s were making $26,800 more per year than those without a degree.  Although there are stories of people who skipped college and achieved financial success, for most Americans the path to higher future earnings involves a four-year college degree,  writes the Fed's Mary Daly.

The refinery supplies 16% of the region's gas, and prices have already jumped from an average of $3.86 to $3.94 in California, analysts say—though a Chevron rep says the blast isn't the only cause of such increases. Still, it could be weeks before normal production is resumed. Investigators—including those who reviewed the BP oil spill—are launching five separate probes to see what caused the explosion and how it could play out. The explosion damaged a section of the refinery that produces clean-burning gasoline, and  California has the cleanest-burning gas in the nation, so this is definitely a market disruption,  says one analyst.

The study out of Columbia University estimates that 36,000 fewer people would have died through early May if those measures began on March 8. If they began on March 1, the figure jumps to 54,000. Scientists came up with the estimates using models that took into account how transmission of the virus slowed once the guidelines did go into effect.  It's a big, big difference,  says Columbia epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman.  That small moment in time, catching it in that growth phase, is incredibly critical in reducing the number of deaths.  The story points out President Trump's reluctance to recommend coronavirus shutdown measures, calling attention to this tweet on March 9:  Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,  he wrote about how the US deals with the flu. The White House, though, is pushing back against the notion that Trump is at fault, reports the Washington Post.  What would have saved lives is if China had been transparent and the World Health Organization had fulfilled its mission,  said a spokesperson.

Ricky Gray was pronounced dead at 9:42pm following a lethal injection at the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Va., the AP reports. The 39-year-old inmate showed no emotion as he was walked into the execution chamber wearing blue jeans and handcuffs. Asked if he had any final words, Gray responded,  Nope.  Gray was condemned to death in 2006 for the murders of 9-year-old Stella Harvey and 4-year-old sister Ruby, and sentenced to life in prison for the slaying of their parents, Bryan and Kathryn Harvey. Bryan Harvey was a guitarist and singer for the rock duo House of Freaks. The family was getting ready to host friends for a chili dinner and Gray and his nephew, Ray Dandridge, were looking for a home to rob when they spotted the open door. Court records show they tied up the family in the basement and Gray slashed their throats and bashed their heads with a hammer before setting their home on fire and fleeing with a computer, a wedding ring, and a basket of cookies. Gray also confessed to participating in the slaying of 21-year-old Ashley Baskerville, her mother Mary Baskerville-Tucker, and stepfather Percyell Tucker days after the Harvey deaths, but he wasn't tried in that case.

The Morning Sentinel reports Kiana French was fishing Sunday on Parlin Pond in Somerset with her father, Gary, and her 14-year-old sister, Cierrah, when their 12-foot aluminum boat started filling with water. Kiana tried to dump the water out using Cierrah's cowboy boot as their dad manned the motor, but it didn't work—and the boat suddenly overturned.  We were a little bit shocked that the boat filled up completely at first,  Kiana tells WGME.  We didn't think we were going to sink.  Kiana was able to get her life jacket on and get the life jackets for her father, who was in shock, and her sister, who's still recovering from a bout with cancer. That's when Kiana knew she was the one who'd have to swim to shore, which she couldn't even see, for help.  I was sad to leave my sister and my dad behind, but I felt like it was the right thing to do,  she tells the Sentinel. The high school senior told herself not to look back at her family and just to keep moving forward through the cold water; after what  seemed like forever,  per the paper, she made it to shore. She'd struggled through 600 yards of choppy water, or the equivalent of six football fields. From the shoreline, Kiana managed to flag down a party boat, and that boat and another vessel rescued Cierrah and the girls' father. EMTs checked all three, who were relatively fine: Other than being cold, there were apparently no other injuries, other than a few scrapes on Kiana's feet and legs. As for Cierrah, she took away her own life lesson from the experience.  I think I learned that I really would not like to die,  she says.

The Corpus Christi Cross Project broke ground at the Abundant Life Fellowship campus off Interstate 37 on Sunday. Pastor Rick Milby says the massive cross will eventually stretch 95 feet wide and 210 feet high, making it the biggest in the Western Hemisphere, reports the Houston Chronicle. The idea for the project came to Milby after he first spotted a huge cross in Houston and heard about  lives that were changed, suicides that were aborted, relationships that were restored because of the influence of the cross,  he writes on the project's website. A cross in Illinois stands just under 200 feet, notes Atlas Obscura, which adds that the FAA requires a light on anything above that height. The Corpus Christi cross will be so big that the design allows for  a two-foot deflection at the top—it will actually sway in the wind two feet back and forth,  Milby tells KRIS TV. And as for whether such winds can topple it, Milby says the concrete foundation's 24 piers will be anchored 48 feet deep,  so if it were to blow over, it would pull up about three acres of land with it.  Once completed, the cross will be visible from 5 miles away by land and 10 miles by air; planes flying into Corpus Christi International Airport will descend about a half-mile to the east. The cross is expected to take about a year, and $1 million, to complete. It will still fall far short of the world's tallest cross—a 495-footer in Madrid. About $142,000 has been raised so far.

Tekerrious  TK  Jackson's death—witnessed by the father's girlfriend, who stopped the beating only long enough to show Duncan how to  whoop  the child properly— was the culmination of 2 weeks of abuse while TK was visiting his father for the summer. Duncan told police he caught the boy not sleeping after his 7pm bedtime Saturday, setting off a flood of violence aimed at getting TK to  man up  that ended only when the boy died.  The saddest thing is, that because of the unconditional love he had for his father, the child would often tell him, ‘I love you daddy,’  one cop tells the Chronicle.","Man Charged With Beating Son, 6, to Death for Not Sleeping","Man Charged With Beating Son, ____, to Death for Not Sleeping",6,Copy( 6 ),0

The transformation began when she got sober and then started working out at age 34 with the intent of getting strong ... and of someday feeling that she  deserved  to pose nude. That happened first in 1994, when she posed for Playboy at 42—twice the age of the typical Playmate. She calls that shoot her  victory lap.  Now, at 58, she does it again, in More. This time around, her intent is to prove that exercise works at any age.

Park enters office at a moment of heightened tensions with the North, weeks after its latest nuclear test, the New York Times notes. In her inaugural address, she urged the North to drop its nuclear weapons program  without delay,  Reuters reports. It marks  a challenge to the survival and future of the Korean people, and there should be no mistake that the biggest victim will be none other than North Korea itself.  According to Reuters, the new president has two options in addressing the North: either  paying off  Pyongyang to halt its program—an option that failed in 2006—or boosting sanctions against the North, a process that has resulted in attacks on Southern territory. Meanwhile, she'll have to win over younger South Koreans fuming over her father's heavy-handed rule. To make things even more complicated, her inauguration comes days after a pastor was arrested after making claims that Park had slept with Kim Jong Il in 2002, the Times notes.

"(Jan 22, 2016  7:05 AM) From Feb. 20 to March 4 of last year, the FBI ran one of the largest child pornography sites on the dark web—a section of the Internet where people usually operate with anonymity—with the goal of using security-cracking software to identify users. Early last year, the site known as Playpen was traced to computers servers located in North Carolina; the FBI in February relocated the site to its own location in Newington, Va. Though the FBI didn't actually upload illicit content to the site, the FBI also didn't attempt to hide 9,000 downloadable images and videos and links to thousands more. The secret operation allowed agents to identify computer addresses for 1,300 of 100,000 users who visited the site over 13 days; 137 have since been charged, reports USA Today. But not everyone is thrilled with how the sting went down. A lawyer for one of the men arrested, a former middle school teacher, likened the move to  flooding a neighborhood with heroin in the hope of snatching an assortment of low-level drug users,  in a court filing requesting charges be dropped. It's not the first time the FBI has used such a ploy. In 2012, it took control of three child porn sites and kept them online to try to identify users. Agents aren't able to prevent the content from being copied and shared elsewhere. But  we had a window of opportunity to get into one of the darkest places on Earth, and not a lot of other options except to not do it,  says a former agent who helped plan a previous site takeover.

"(Apr 26, 2019  11:41 AM CDT) On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders noted that the administration doesn't comment on hostage negotiations, a remark necessitated by reports that North Korea billed the US $2 million for Otto Warmbier's hospice care before the 21-year-old student was sent back to the US in 2017. On Friday morning, however, President Trump headed over to Twitter to address the issue himself, the Washington Post reports.  No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else,  Trump tweeted. Trump doubled down on this claim while speaking with reporters Friday outside the White House, saying,  We did not pay money for our great Otto. I haven't paid money for any hostage. ... We don't pay money for hostages.  Sources tell the Post that the bill—which some, including Warmbier's father, think sounds like a ransom—made its way to the Treasury Department and stayed unpaid at least through 2017. In his tweet, Trump also said  this is not the Obama Administration that paid 1.8 Billion Dollars for four hostages, or gave five terroist hostages plus, who soon went back to battle, for traitor Sgt. Bergdahl!  Those incidents are apparently references to a $400 million cash payment sent to Iran on the same day Iran released four US prisoners in 2016—the US says the cash wasn't a ransom—and the exchange of five Taliban members for US soldier Bowe Bergdahl. In a second tweet Friday, Trump quoted a  Cheif [sic] Hostage Negotiator  as saying,  President Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States.

"(Aug 16, 2018  4:46 PM CDT) One of al-Qaeda's master bombmakers may have been killed in Yemen last year, according to a UN report. If Ibrahim al-Asiri—who was believed to have been involved in an unsuccessful 2009 plot to blow up an aircraft over Detroit on Christmas Day with an underwear bomb—is dead, it would  represent a serious blow to operational capability  for al-Qaeda, the UN says. The report does not detail how al-Asiri may have died. Government officials in the US are now looking into evidence that the Saudi-born terrorist is, in fact, dead, CNN reports. But some analysts say that reports of al-Asiri's death should be received with skepticism because al-Qaeda has yet to acknowledge it. One former British spy tells CNN that  it would be extremely out of the ordinary  for al-Qaeda not to release a eulogy for such a senior leader. In addition to the Christmas Day plot that failed due to a malfunction, al-Asiri, born in 1982, is believed to have built a bomb used in a 2009 attempt to assassinate a Saudi official (the bomber, al-Asiri's brother, was killed in the attempt), according to a 2014 BBC profile. In 2010, al-Asiri built bombs disguised as printer cartridges that were intended to be shipped to Chicago, the Washington Post reported in 2012. This plot was foiled thanks to a tip from Saudi intelligence.

That's the head of Greece's Red Cross commenting on a devastating scene: A group of 26 people who died just 100 feet from the sea and were apparently found hugging one another. They were victims of fast-moving wildfires near Athens that, according to one local official, have claimed 60 lives thus far. And an official with Greece's ambulance service says that number will rise as charred homes and cars are searched.  Unfortunately, at this stage, we do not expect to find more people injured, only more dead,  he tells the New York Times. The largest of the fires, which began late Monday, are located near Rafina, roughly 15 miles east of Athens, and Kineta, about 30 miles west. The aforementioned dead in the seaside village of Mati, which is in the Rafina region, didn't make it to the water but others have: The Coast Guard and about 30 private boats have taken some 700 people away from the flames; at least four who tried to flee drowned.

A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the release of Woodfox, who spent more than 40 years in isolation after being accused of killing a guard. His supporters say it was retribution for his Black Panther Party activism to protest prison conditions. The order came a day after a federal judge ruled that the state can't fairly try Woodfox, now 68, a third time for the killing of a prison guard 43 years ago, and that the  only just remedy  would be setting him free after all the years he spent in  extended lockdown.  Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is appealing the release order, saying Woodfox is a killer who should remain locked up. The stay by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans blocks Woodfox's release until 1pm Friday, providing time for the court to decide whether to accept the state's appeal. His attorney, George Kendall, says he is  hopeful and optimistic  the court will release Woodfox while the state's appeal is pending. But he acknowledges the court could order Woodfox to stay in jail while that process plays out. He describes the conditions Woodfox has served his time under as  brutal,  and blasts the attorney general for fighting to keep him incarcerated.

Authorities haven't commented on how the woman died but say Cwiklinski suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound. According to a neighbor, the woman and a man believed to be Cwiklinski lived in the home where police were initially called and where a bomb squad was later seen investigating a black vehicle.

"(Feb 16, 2011  8:37 AM) Chicago's population fell 6.9% during the decade that ended in 2010, leaving it with fewer people than lived there in 1920. The US Census Bureau reports a population of 2,695,598 people, just under the 2.7 million that were reported nearly a century ago, the Wall Street Journal reports. The recession is likely to blame for a significant migration to the suburbs and the South; even so, Chicago is expected to remain the third-largest city in the nation behind New York and Los Angeles. The Windy City's population peaked at 3.62 million in 1950, then declined for years until it experienced a boom in the 1990s. This most recent decline affected the city's black population more than most; it fell from more than 1 million to 887,608.  The black decline is really powering the city loss,  says a demographer, calling it  part of the great reverse migration to the South.  As Chicago's population fell, however, the population in neighboring counties surged—which could mean those traditionally conservative counties will become more politically diverse.",Chicago's Population Dips Below 1920 Level,Chicago's Population Dips Below ____ Level,1920,Copy( 1920 ),0

Trading on his celebrity status, Mr. Trump personally appeared in advertisements making false promises to convince people to spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn't afford for lessons they never got,  said Eric Schneiderman in a statement that accuses Trump of a  bait and switch.  Trump wasted no time in swinging back, blasting the suit as politically motivated (Schneiderman is a Democrat; Trump is decidedly not) and Schneiderman himself as a  lightweight  who is  trying to extort me with a civil law suit.  Team Donald says that 98% of students rate Trump University as  excellent,  adds the AP.  The attorney general has been angry because he felt that Mr. Trump should have done much more for him in terms of fundraising,  says a lawyer for Trump.  This entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous waste of taxpayers' money.  It's not the first lawsuit; CNN notes that students filed a class-action lawsuit against the school in 2010, accusing it of being  like an infomercial  that doesn't deliver on its guarantees of success.","Trump U Sued for Fraud, $40M","Trump U Sued for Fraud, $____M",40,Copy( 40 ),0

The activists were working with China Labor Watch, a New York-based nonprofit organization, and were investigating Huajian Group factories, the AP reports. The US State Department called Monday for their immediate release. The company has denied allegations of excessive overtime and low wages. It says it stopped producing Ivanka Trump shoes months ago. The lawyer, Wen Yu, said Tuesday that after a day and a half of waiting he was finally able to meet his client, Hua Haifeng.  His condition inside is OK. Nobody beat him,  Yu said.  It's just that he has to sleep next to the toilet. People go to pee all night.  He said the cell was crowded with 21 people who have been ordered not to speak with Hua. Yu said he was told the case was being handled by a national security team, rather than a criminal police squad.  This is strange because it is a small case,  he said.

"(Feb 20, 2018  11:52 AM) Louisville must vacate its 2013 men's basketball title following an NCAA appeals panel's decision to uphold sanctions against the men's program in the sex scandal case. The Cardinals will have to vacate 123 victories including the championship, and return millions in conference revenue from the 2012-15 NCAA Tournaments, per the AP. The decision announced Tuesday by the governing body's Infraction Appeals Committee ruled that the NCAA has the authority to take away championships for what it considers major rule violations. Louisville now must forfeit its third NCAA title, victories, and income from 2010-14, when the violations occurred. The decision culminates the governing body's investigation that followed allegations in a 2015 book by escort Katina Powell that former Cardinals basketball staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits.  I cannot say this strongly enough: We believe the NCAA is simply wrong,  said Louisville interim President Dr. Greg Postel. He made the case that the university admitted wrongdoing and cooperated with the investigation.  Under the NCAA's own rules, this cooperation should have been a factor in the severity of the punishment,  he said.  Instead, it was ignored.

Nichols, who must report to a parole office in Great Falls, was granted parole in April, per the AP, citing coverage in the Missoulian. Nichols, 86, was sentenced to 85 years in prison for kidnapping biathlete Kari Swenson in the mountains near Big Sky and killing Alan Goldstein, a friend helping to search for Swenson when she failed to return home from her run. The reason for the kidnapping? Don wanted Swenson to be a bride for his then 19-year-old son. Swenson, who was 22, said she was chained up during her ordeal and spotted her would-be rescuers before her abductors did. She yelled at them to leave because Nichols had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to help her. Nichols shot Goldstein, and Nichols' son Dan apparently accidentally shot Swenson. She said she was left for dead with a  sucking chest wound  for hours as Goldstein's body lay nearby. Don and Dan Nichols fled and were arrested five months later after a manhunt in the mountains of southwestern Montana.

"(Feb 7, 2015  8:04 AM) MacKenzie Jackson's mom died in 2012 at age 39; her dad died last month at 42. And now the North Dakota 18-year-old is putting the future she planned for—cosmetology school—on hold, replacing it with a new goal: to become the legal guardian of her sister Meagan, 16, and brother Spencer, 14. The Jackson siblings had a difficult upbringing: Mom Rebecca started doing meth when MacKenzie was little, both parents were in poor health, and a couple months before dad Cory died, Meagan and Spencer were put into foster care.  The conditions of my house weren't good for them to be in and my dad was drinking a lot,  MacKenzie tells People.  But it was only after my dad died that I knew I was now going to be in charge of getting them back.  She had already been taking care of her siblings since their mother's death, taking on responsibilities like grocery shopping and making sure the younger kids made it to school, doctor's appointments, and other things, all while keeping her own grades up. After her dad's death, she called social services and began working to become their legal guardian; she also moved out of the house they had been living in.  I want Spencer and Meagan to come back to a new house where we can make new memories,  she explains. She adds that while an older relative could also become the teens' guardian,  I know them the best. They're my responsibility.  And, she tells Valley News Live,  They just really want to come home with me, they just really want their sister, that's all they want.  But she will have support from other family members, including a 34-year-old cousin who lives nearby and says,  She deserves to have her siblings. They belong together.  A GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $12,000 to help the family, and KFGO reports that a benefit is being held for the family today at a local church.

"(Jun 15, 2017  2:21 PM CDT) Lovers of sports spectacles can rejoice: The long-rumored super-fight between undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather Jr. and mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor has been made official. Yahoo Sports reports the two men will face each other in a boxing match on August 26 in Las Vegas. The 40-year-old Mayweather will end a 23-month retirement to face McGregor, the 28-year-old Irishman who went from being a rookie in the Ultimate Fighting Championship to the biggest star in the history of mixed martial arts in just a few years. According to ESPN, McGregor first suggested the idea of a cross-sport superfight with Mayweather on Conan O’Brien’s talk show back in 2015. It wasn’t until McGregor won the UFC lightweight belt last November, however, that the fantasy started to become a reality. Mayweather is considered the heavy favorite going into the fight, though regardless of the outcome McGregor’s paycheck promises to be by far the biggest of his career. According to the New York Times, Mayweather’s 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao drew nearly 4.5 million viewers through pay-per-view. McGregor’s biggest pay-per-view draw to date drew 1.6 million. Forbes reports each fighter could take home more than $100 million for the fight. The two men will meet at the light-middleweight limit of 154 pounds, which bodes well for McGregor, who is currently the UFC's 155-pound champion. Mayweather, meanwhile, won one of the biggest fights of his life when he jumped up in weight to fight Oscar de la Hoya for the 154-pound belt in 2007.

Now their nightmare has doubled: Darryl's 18-year-old brother, Ryan, was killed by a hit-and-run driver over the weekend near the college where he was a freshman, the Detroit News reports.

He undid the changes Saturday amid a shockwave of bad press, but it seems Armstrong's issues with pregnancy go back the days when he was Google's VP of national sales.

Armstrong had promoted her to a top sales-director position and publicly praised her work, but in the month she lost two unborn children, Armstrong demoted her.

But while watching an old documentary about the excavation, Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum officials realized there was a problem: They had only 400 of the artifacts on record, so what happened to the rest? After a monthslong search, the last living witnesses to the dig provided information that led to 48 cardboard boxes that had been tucked away at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, reports AFP.  I had considered the discovery of such a huge collection in whole after nearly half a century as unlikely as finding the treasure of the lost Galleon,  Piotr Cywinski, the museum's director, says in a release. Cywinski says someone may have intended to study the artifacts—including stamps, medical kits, brushes, fragments of shoes and kitchenware, lighters, and watches, per Haaretz—that belonged to those killed at the camp. But  there was a political turnabout in 1968 and the communist authority took a clearly anti-Semitic course,  which may have sidelined the project.  The times then were difficult for topics related to the Holocaust,  Cywinski says. He adds  this is a unique collection in every way  and  an unexpected, totally unique day in the newest history of our Museum.

"(Apr 6, 2016  1:26 AM CDT) One of the world's most popular apps has just added strong end-to-end encryption, making the communications of 1 billion users off-limits to wiretaps and potentially setting up a US legal battle bigger than the Apple-FBI clash. WhatsApp has been steadily increasing encryption over the last 18 months and with its latest update, text messages, attachments, and voice calls can only be deciphered by the recipient, meaning that it would be impossible for the Facebook-owned company to comply with wiretap orders, the Guardian reports. The encryption was built by a relatively small team of engineers, including renowned cryptographer Moxie Marlinspike. Given the scale, this is a  landmark event  for privacy advocates, writes a blogger at Fortune. WhatsApp founder Jan Koum grew up in Soviet-era Ukraine, and he says one of the company's core beliefs is to protect the private communications of its users, most of whom are outside the US.  We're somewhat lucky here in the United States, where we hope that the checks and balances hold out for many years to come and decades to come,  he tells Wired.  But in a lot of countries you don't have these checks and balances. The argument can be made: Maybe you want to trust the government, but you shouldn't because you don't know where things are going to go in the future.  He says that while the decision to encrypt was made before Facebook acquired WhatsApp,  if they were not supportive of us, we wouldn't be here today.",WhatsApp Has Added Encryption for 1B Users,WhatsApp Has Added Encryption for ____B Users,1,Copy( 1 ),0

Hall of the University of Maine, Michael Rosbash of Brandeis University, and Michael W. Young of Rockefeller University were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for shedding light on our biological clocks, reports the AP. In their work with fruit flies, the scientists were  able to peek inside our biological clock  to make discoveries that  explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth’s revolutions,  the Nobel prize committee said in a statement.  You are kidding me,  Rosbash said in response to getting the call, per the Guardian. He and his colleagues will share the $1.1 million prize. The researchers isolated a gene that plays a vital role in regulating circadian rhythms, showing how it is responsible for a protein that accumulates at night and degrades during the day. Among other things, the scientists raised  awareness of the importance of a proper sleep hygiene,  said Juleen Zierath of the Nobel academy.

"(Sep 10, 2020  11:56 AM CDT) A Michigan woman picked up her mail on Tuesday and was transported back in time. Figuratively, of course. Sitting on top of Brittany Keech's stack of mail was a postcard that might've appeared somewhat timely— Halloween greetings,  it read, next to an image of a witch and cat—if not for the postmark. It was dated Oct. 29, 1920, from Jamestown.  I start looking at it and I'm like, 'OK, it's been through some wear and tear,'  the Belding resident tells WXMI, which reports the postcard was sent with a one-cent stamp featuring George Washington. Keech is now hoping to track down relatives of the writer, who'd directed the note to a Roy McQueen of Belding's Division Street.  Dear Cousins, Hope this will find you all well,  Flossie Burgess wrote in a neat script.  I just finished my history lesson,  she went on, describing the  awful cold  weather and her mother's  awful lame knees.  Keech hopes the postcard will resonate with a family member. According to Ancestry.com, there was a Flossie Burgess living in Jamestown in 1940. But she would've been around age 9 in 1920. It's unclear how the postcard ended up with Keech, but a USPS spokesperson says it's unlikely that it was lost in the mail all this time.

Anderson makes the case that Christmas should be pushed from Dec. 25 to Feb. 7. She's got all kinds of arguments—it's too close to Thanksgiving, for instance, which puts a strain on wallets, travel, and even holiday parties—but her main one revolves around what she sees as the  function of Christmas  (as opposed to the  meaning of Christmas,  which has more religious connotations). And that function?  To bring light and warmth to a dark, cold time of year, thereby making us all a little happier.  But when the holiday ends, we get the  sad last hurrah  of New Year's before beginning the depressing, months-long sludge to spring.  This is totally backward,  she writes.  The Christmas spirit ought to help us get through the darkest, iciest months of the year.  Besides, the date Dec. 25 is  totally arbitrary  in terms of the birthdate of Jesus, which is unknown, so why not give ourselves a break?  Lengthening the Christmas season would give us all more time—more time to spread out our shopping, decorating, baking, and reveling, and also more time to retreat to our homes and escape the hustle and bustle,  writes Anderson. As for why Feb. 7, a few reasons: 7 is considered lucky, it's the sum of two and five, and it would place Christmas a week before Valentine's Day, mirroring the Christmas/New Year's set-up we have now.

"(Sep 5, 2018  6:21 AM CDT) British prosecutors charged two Russian men Wednesday with the nerve agent poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The Crown Prosecution Service said the men, known to British investigators as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are charged in absentia with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, and use of the nerve agent Novichok, reports the AP. Russian law forbids extradition of its own citizens, but Britain has issued a European Arrest Warrant, meaning the suspects can be detained if they leave Russia for another European country. Assistant police commissioner Neil Basu conceded it was  very very unlikely  police would be in a position to arrest them any time soon. Police say the men, both about 40, flew to London on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned March 4. Basu said they were probably using aliases. Basu appealed to the public  to come forward and tell us who they are.  Police released images of the men as they traveled through London and Salisbury between March 2 and March 4. Police say the two men flew back to Moscow from Heathrow on the evening of March 4, hours after the Skripals were found collapsed on a park bench. Police believe the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a perfume bottle and applied to Skripal's front door of Sergei Skripal's house. The bottle was found by a local man, Charlie Rowley, in June; he was hospitalized and his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, died. Police haven't determined where the bottle was between poisonings, and aren't ready to bring charges in the second poisoning.

A Delta flight from New York City to Palm Beach, Fla., was grounded yesterday after two passengers argued over a reclining seat. A fellow passenger and witness tells News4Jax:  This woman who was sitting next to me knitting actually tried reclining her seat back and the woman behind her started screaming and swearing.

Potential candidates including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Deval Patrick have had one-on-one sitdowns with the former president at his Washington office in recent months, though, sources say, the subject of the 2020 race hasn't come up in many of the conversations. Rather, Obama is eager to discuss the Democratic Party's prospects in both the midterms and the 2020 election and how those prospects can be improved in order to push back against President Trump and his policies, and is looking to act as a  sounding board  for those likely to play a large role in the party's future. Obama will, however, offer his opinion on campaigns and campaigning against Trump specifically, and his help getting donors and party VIPs to return calls.

She had been killed with a gunshot to the head, and her body was wrapped in duct tape, tied with rope, and put inside of a sleeping bag that was wrapped in a carpet. Unable to identify the woman, authorities called her the  Maidenwater victim.  On Wednesday, the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had identified the woman as Lena Reyes-Geddes of Youngstown, Ohio, FOX reports. Reyes-Geddes was originally from Mexico and authorities were able to identify her body using DNA samples from relatives in that country, per KSTU.

The bear had been captured only hours before, the Guardian reports.  Run and save yourself,  the president of an animal rights group implored.  We are on the side of the bear and of freedom.  The president of the province of Trentino had ordered the capture of the European brown bear after it was spotted near residential areas. After the escape, he authorized rangers to shoot the bear, labeled M49, if it went near people, per MSN. Italy's environment minister overruled that order, saying,  M49's escape from the enclosure cannot justify an action that would cause its death.  He sent a team to Trentino to help catch the bear without harming it, and to investigate the escape. Animal rights advocates mocked the bear's captors. One cheered the bear on, and another said:  A solid electrified fence with adequate power is an insurmountable barrier even for the most astute bears. Obviously the structure was not working properly, since bears do not fly.  An anti-hunting organization said that  evidently, M49 is an escape genius … gifted with superpowers akin to a hero of Marvel Comics.  The group suggested the bear was allowed to escape Sunday so it could be decreed dangerous and killed.

The poll, which was conducted Friday and released Sunday, found that the former New York City mayor has the highest unfavorable rating among likely primary voters of any Democratic hopeful, Politico reports. Some 25% view Bloomberg unfavorably, according to the poll, and he is the first choice of just 4% of likely voters, which puts him in sixth place, behind Kamala Harris but ahead of Andrew Yang. The poll found that Joe Biden is the current frontrunner, with 31% support, followed by Bernie Sanders at 20%, Elizabeth Warren at 18%, Pete Buttigieg at 8%, and Harris at 6%.

Biden, Sanders, and Warren were 4, 5, and 6 points ahead of Trump, respectively. Analysts say a Bloomberg run might hurt Biden and help Sanders and Warren by drawing centrist voters away from the frontrunner.

But the convicted Georgia murderer was granted a stay of execution just 30 minutes before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection, the Guardian reports. Hill, 53, also saw a scheduled execution halted last year, but this time around things are different: Now every medical expert who has evaluated him agrees he is mentally retarded, including three experts who initially refused to diagnose him as such in 2000. They recanted last week, admitting their work had been sloppy. That would seem to satisfy Georgia's near-impossible and unusual requirement that a prisoner's mental retardation be proved  beyond a reasonable doubt.  Still, earlier in the day, the state parole board, the Supreme Court of Georgia, and the US Supreme Court all declined to stop the execution. It was the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals whose judges agreed to further investigate Hill's mental status. Writing for the Atlantic, Andrew Cohen hopes this case reaches the high court. That's because Hill  presents the justices with an opportunity to strengthen—to save, really—the letter and the spirit  of their 2002 ruling that established that mentally retarded prisoners should not be executed, he writes.  In that case, they tried to be all things to all people. It was a mistake.

"(Nov 29, 2010  2:34 PM) For years, five children were concealed from society, living in a dilapidated row home in Pennsylvania with no heat, electricity, or running water. Detectives recently found the children, ages 2 to 13, and charged parents Louann Bowers, 33, and Sinhue Johnson, 45, with child endangerment. The children had no birth certificates or immunizations and had never attended school, the AP reports. They were living with their parents in one room and drank rainwater that came through a leaky roof. Neighbors said they never saw any sign of kids.  How did they do that?  wondered one. Making the story even stranger: Bowers ran away from home when she was 16 and  didn't want to be found,  her attorney said.  I think, unfortunately, Mom's desire to not be found by her family impacted the children's growth.

The question is sure to come to mind after reading about a bizarre case out of the UK, where Essex Police are on #poowatch and tweeting about it. This after a suspected drug dealer believed to have drugs hidden in his body has now for 21 days refused to poop. The BBC reports the 24-year-old was arrested Jan. 17 and has been under supervision since then, with the department's Operation Raptor team that arrested him providing updates like this one, tweeted Wednesday:  Day 21/3 weeks for our man on #poowatch still no movements/items to report, he will remain with us until Friday when we are back at court where we will be requesting a further 8 days should he not produce anything before that hearing.  Last Friday they tweeted that the man is being watched by doctors and was in fine health at the time. Per the BBC, police decided to keep the public informed of the man's bowel movements in an effort to quash any illusions that drug dealing is  glamorous.  The man is reportedly a couple of days away from what a police rep believes to be the record for a suspect not pooping: 23 days. As for the original question about how long one can go, an answer-ish: The Cleveland Clinic says to seek medical help if it's been longer than three weeks; a 16-year-old British girl died in 2013 after the Telegraph reports she did not have a bowel movement for eight weeks.

The bill, which officials say will cost roughly $900 billion over 10 years, would cover 96% of the country, requiring nearly everyone to buy health insurance by 2013. Individuals could do this on a regulated exchange, where private insurers would compete with a new public option. Until then, temporary government programs will provide help for people who’ve been turned away from private insurance companies, reports AP. The plan will also significantly expand Medicaid. No Republicans are expected to vote for the bill, complaining that it would raise taxes on upper-income earners, and cut Medicare payments to insurers.

It was one of three fired at the home in retaliation for a critical restaurant review, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Walley had penned the review on Facebook, explaining her disabled mother was denied service at the Daybreak Diner where she had once suffered a fall.  It was my mother's birthday, and all she wanted was her favorite Greek omelet,  Walley wrote. Told she couldn't be in the restaurant without a companion,  she arrived back home in tears,  Walley added in the review, which prompted hundreds of negative comments and some angry phone calls to the diner, per Fox 35. The restaurant said employees  have never and will never practice any form of discrimination.  But the review was still a talking point that night as the son of the diner's owner drank beer with his roommate and a family friend, 42-year-old Norman Auvil.

Jay Darshane says he was  trying to help the police with their investigation  when officers showed up right after the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting at his restaurant, which WGN notes is located about 50 yards from where the fatal shots were fired. Darshane says the BK's assistant district manager called him that night to tell him there were  four or five  officers asking to review the eatery's surveillance video. Darshane gave the OK, and cops holed up with the tape for nearly two hours, he says—but when they left, there was an  inexplicable 86-minute gap,  from 9:13pm to 10:39pm, that included when Laquan was shot, the Tribune notes.  I didn't know they were going to delete it,  Darshane says, adding that he testified about the missing video earlier this year in front of a grand jury. But State's Attorney Anita Alvarez has said there's no forensic evidence to back up claims the tape was erased on purpose, and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy says those claims are  absolutely untrue  and that there were  apparently technical difficulties.  The Tribune notes that the surveillance camera probably wouldn't have had the vantage point to show Laquan's shooting, but it may have depicted some of the teen's movements right before.

"(NoneDate) It was 4:40 in the afternoon on Saturday, March 25, 1911. The Triangle Shirtwaist Company was close to closing down for the day in New York City. Someone dropped a still-smoking object onto the factory floor. Within minutes, the eighth, ninth, and 10th floors of the building the company occupied were on fire. Workers rushed to the exits, only to find that some of them had been locked. Onlookers outside the building watched in horror as workers jumped out the windows in a vain attempt to survive. When it was finally over, 146 workers, mostly young women, were dead. A firestorm of controversy followed as investigations revealed the company had almost no safety precautions. The workers' rights movement was galvanized in the wake of the fire. The Wagner Act passed soon afterward, making unions and collective bargaining legal.

At Fox News, however, Newt Gingrich is predicting the  great political surprise  of the new year: Republicans will not only win, they'll win big.  After members of the elite media have spent two years savaging President Trump, lying about Republican legislation, and reassuring themselves that Republican defeat was inevitable, the size of the GOP victory in 2018 will be an enormous shock,  writes the former House speaker.

The fear of failure and the fear of wasting your time, and the doubt that you can actually achieve something big on a huge scale.  Craig knew soon after promoting his service that  huge  was an apt way to describe public reaction. At the very least, he proved wrong his girlfriend, who had proclaimed,  You will not sell a single potato.   On our second day that we were live … we started promoting it on Reddit and we got $2,000 in orders, and I just knew this was it,  he tells WFAA. They've sold more than 2,000 tubers since the site's launch in May. What's really  cool,  according to Craig, is that  it takes me about 30 seconds to write on a potato.  And that,  in some sort of weird way, we've had an impact on somebody's life—even for a split second,  he says.

The men paid for everything from hotel stays and a rent-free home where Bush's family apparently lived to a limousine and a new suit when he accepted his Heisman in New York in December 2005. The coaches who presided over the alleged misdeeds—football's Pete Carroll and basketball's Tim Floyd—left USC in the past year.

But its growth will level off around 2065—meaning Nigeria looks on track to be No. 1 in the subsequent decades.

He says some of the survivors were critically injured. At least one person on the ground was also injured when the plane slammed into a maintenance building and caught fire.

According to Reuters, Wayne Huntsman pleaded guilty to three counts of arson Friday for starting the 2014 King Fire in Northern California that took hundreds of firefighters a month to get under control. His sentence was increased because a number of firefighters were injured and 12 homes and dozens of other structures were destroyed. Thousands of residents were displaced by the fire.

"(Feb 4, 2015  8:50 AM) More details from  one of the darkest chapters of Australia's maritime history  are coming to light, nearly 400 years after they occurred. On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered  by accident.  Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more:  This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia—albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here—so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.

Prosecutors said Friday they were in talks with engineer Brandon Bostian's attorney to have him surrender on the charges.

"(Mar 19, 2014  4:43 AM CDT) Around 15% of near-Earth asteroids are binaries—an asteroid with an orbiting  moon  sometimes nearly as big as itself—but what happens when a binary slams into our planet? The answer, at least some of the time, is the creation of two huge craters, and Spanish researchers believe they have found evidence of one such double impact 458 million years ago, the BBC reports. They say two large craters in Sweden, dubbed Lockne and Malingen, appear to have been formed at the exact same time by an impact big enough to have caused an  atmospheric blow-out  over the site.  Double impact craters must be of the same age, otherwise they could just be two craters right next to each other,  lead researcher Dr. Jens Ormo explains. In the case of the Swedish craters, the area would have been sea-covered at the time of impact, and the researchers analyzed plankton-like fossils found there to determine the craters' age—and that they likely resulted from a double impact. Backing up that theory: The craters are only about 10 miles apart, reports the Independent, which describes the distance as  close enough that the two asteroids would have been pulled together by gravity, but far enough for the craters to not have overlapped.  There are a number of other proposed double-impact sites, in Quebec, southern Russia, and southern Germany.

"(Aug 23, 2011  9:51 AM CDT) Turkey's military said today airstrikes on suspected Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq this week have killed an estimated 90 to 100 guerrillas and warned that it would press ahead with offensives against the group both inside Turkey and across the border.  Iraq's north and domestic areas will be monitored for separatist terrorist activity and air and ground operations will continue,  it said in a statement. The Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, had a very different number of casualties: zero. Turkey's claim was a  baseless fabrication  intended to  raise the spirits of their soldiers and to create more pretexts to continue their war against civilians,  said a PKK spokesman. The Kurdish and central Iraqi governments have been extremely hesitant to criticize Turkey for the airstrikes.

"(Sep 10, 2015  12:27 AM CDT) Arkansas will resume lethal injections after a 10-year gap starting next month with the first of four double executions, Gov. Asa Hutchinson says. The state hasn't executed an inmate since 2005, largely because of court challenges to its lethal-injection law and a nationwide shortage of drugs often used during executions. But last week, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge requested execution dates for eight inmates because their appeals had been exhausted, and prison officials said they had an adequate supply of lethal-injection drugs. Hutchinson set four dates through January but acknowledged that challenges are likely. The first two executions are scheduled Oct. 21 for inmates Bruce Earl Ward and Don William Davis. Ward, a former perfume salesman, was convicted in the 1989 killing of 18-year-old Rebecca Doss. Davis, who had an execution date set in 2006 that was later stayed, was sentenced to death for the 1990 murder of a woman during a burglary. The state has had multiple executions in the past, including triple executions in 1994 and 1997. At the time, the state Department of Correction said multiple executions reduced stress on prison staff.

Ronnie Lottz's bar started getting attention when comedian Tamale Rocks posted a video on YouTube of the mirror, which would give anyone concealed in the utility closet behind it a full view of the toilet, NBC Chicago reports. Lottz tells the Chicago Tribune that cops searched the bar after receiving a complaint and found nothing wrong.  There is no hanky-panky going on in that bathroom,  he says.  It's part of the gag.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport's ruling also blocked Russia from bidding to host major sporting events for two years, per the AP. The case centered on a 2014 Olympics doping scheme, with accusations that Russian state authorities tampered with a database from the Moscow testing laboratory before handing it over to WADA investigators last year, the New York Times reports. Russian athletes and teams will still be allowed to compete at next year's Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, as well as world championships—including the 2022 World Cup in Qatar—if they're not implicated in doping or covering up positive tests. One small win for Russia is the proposed team name at major events. The name  Russia  can be retained on uniforms if the words  Neutral Athlete  or  Neutral Team  have equal prominence, the court said.

That includes sugars added to foods and those present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices, but not those occurring naturally in fruits. After a review of about 9,000 studies, WHO's expert panel says dropping sugar intake to that level will combat obesity and cavities. Dr. Francesco Branca, WHO's director for nutrition, conceded the new target was somewhat aspirational.  We should aim for 5% if we can ... but 10% is more realistic,  he said. WHO warned many of the sugars eaten today are hidden in processed foods, pointing out that one tablespoon of ketchup contains about one teaspoon of sugar and that for some people, including children, drinking a single can of sweetened soda would already exceed their daily sugar limit. Americans and others in the West eat a lot of sugar: Their average sugar intake would have to drop by two-thirds to meet WHO's suggested limit.

The department found 137 of them, but less than half actually left the country, whether voluntarily or via deportation. Another 20 died while their cases were still pending, while at least 20 others never saw their cases pursued for various reasons (often poor health). And in 10 cases uncovered by an AP investigation, suspects were ordered deported only to end up in legal limbo—still eligible for Social Security and other public benefits—because no other country would allow the men in. Four are still living in the US, having exhausted their appeals, and the other six lived in the US until they died.  I don't think it's any lack of effort by the American government,  says the chief Nazi hunter for the Simon Wiesenthal Center. But, in at least one case, a suspect remained eligible for public benefits even after his appeals had been exhausted. And, in dozens of other cases, suspects were allowed to keep benefits as they fought deportation. But the US can't just put these people on trial—rather than trying (unsuccessfully) to deport them—because the alleged crimes didn't take place on American soil, the AP explains.

All while making dinner, going to soccer games, serving on the PTA, planning birthday parties, and the myriad of other things mothers somehow find time to do. So, after meeting many millennials in the Bushwick art and yoga scene who sought her advice on and help with everything from landlords to resumés, she launched Need a Mom two weeks ago and already has six clients, reports the Daily Beast. Keneally charges $40 an hour to do anything from cook a meal to sew buttons, reports a sponsored piece in the Bushwick Daily that notes she's a mom, not a maid—so she won't clean your apartment.

The UN estimates that chemical labs around the world are cranking out  new psychoactive substances  weekly, so fast the DEA and other law enforcement agencies can't keep up. The Journal takes a deep look at one of those substances, a synthetic opioid called U-47700, that caused 125 fatal overdoses—at least—in the first nine months of 2016. U-47700 was created by a US pharmaceutical company in the 1970 while searching for the  Holy Grail,  a painkiller as strong as morphine but without the risk. It was abandoned after tests on mice showed it caused dependence. Enter unscrupulous foreign labs—many of them in China—which officials say are combing through old patent records to recreate U-47700 and other abandoned drugs. The labs sell these new versions of old synthetic drugs online, labeling them research chemicals not for human consumption to give themselves legal cover. The first fatal U-47700 overdose in the US was believed to be in May 2015. The DEA didn't move to add it to the list of illegal drugs until September 2016, the same month two 13-year-old friends in Utah overdosed on it. It probably won't help.

They were [mostly] in a cardboard box, nine of the 11—they're very small remains,  says Detroit Police Lt. Brian Bowser. He says some dead infants' names are known to police, and the medical examiner is investigating. At least one of the infants has been on the premises since 2009, WXYZ reports. The funeral home was shut down in April over conditions inspectors called  deplorable  and other violations, including unclean rooms, operating without proper registration, failure to deposit over $20,000 for prepaid goods and services, and keeping mold-covered bodies in an advanced state of decomposition, per WXYZ. The home was told to either hand off its prepaid contracts to another provider or simply cancel them and refund customers. Now, it's far worse:  This is horrific, and it's unethical,  says Jameca LaJoyce Boone, who managed the funeral home until the shutdown, per the New York Times.

Police say they're investigating the theft of an urn containing the ashes of Ryan Wagner, a 6-year-old boy who died from cancer in 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Ryan's parents say that after the urn and other items, including the  courage beads  the boy was given during his treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, were stolen from a safe during a December burglary, the $5,000 reward they offered became a ransom when they were told of a threat to dump out the ashes. On the Bring Ryan Home Facebook page, mom Anita Wagner says they handed $5,000 in small bills to local lawyer Kathleen Bryson last Friday and she returned 45 minutes later with the ashes and other belongings. Bryson tells the Lost Coast Outpost that her client contacted her after learning that people he knew had the ashes and planned to dump them out. Bryson says she gave the family her $500 fee and doesn't believe her client had any share of the reward.  The burglars—I don't know how they sleep at night,  she says.

In honor of marijuana's biggest day of the year, potheads nationwide will light up $4.20 joints, throw 4/20 concerts, hold 4/20 bake-offs, ring in 4:20pm—and some will even do it legally, now that the Man has horned in on the action—all in celebration of their favorite, well, herb.  Most of our chapters are in celebration mode,  says pot legalization advocate Allen St. Pierre.  That was not the case 10 years ago; 4/20 was a day of protest.  But why 4/20? The number of chemicals in pot? The obscure multipliers in that Bob Dylan song? The Fresno Bee checks in with Steven Hager, the former editor of High Times, who says he first saw it referenced at a Grateful Dead show in 1990: A flier being passed around invited potheads to show up at 4:20pm on April 20 for a little  420 -ing. Intrigued, Hager dug a little deeper and found  it's not any of these other crazy coincidences that people bring up.  The term dated back another two decades to a group of five San Rafael High School students dubbed the Waldos. In 1971, they were given a  treasure map  to a weed patch, and agreed to meet after school at 4:20pm. They got high—which eventually turned into a daily after-school activity—and went out searching.  I thought, 'This is important!' And you know everybody thought I had lost my mind,  says Hager.  I started talking to people and I said we will build everything around 420—420 is the new everything.  And it worked: Hager's pet project is now a marketing juggernaut.

But you might be right, and researchers in Britain are currently planning to test that theory. They’re about to spend 10 years and millions of dollars trying to build the Babbage Analytical Machine, a massive punch card computer dreamed up by eccentric mathematician Charles Babbage in the 1830s, the New York Times reports. Babbage never built the analytical machine, and experts have spent years arguing about whether it would have worked. Complicating matters: Babbage was constantly tinkering with his design, so there’s no single blueprint to follow. So a variety of plans will be posted online next year, with the public invited to sort through them and suggest which parts should be incorporated. Researchers will then build a computer model of the room-sized machine and—hopefully—construct it at the Science Museum in London.

"(Sep 25, 2020  9:37 AM CDT) Under a bill House Democrats are preparing, Ruth Bader Ginsburg would have had to retire in 2011—and William O. Douglas, the longest-serving justice in Supreme Court history, would have stepped down in 1957 instead of 1975. The bill, which Democrats plan to introduce next week, limits the terms of Supreme Court justices to 18 years. It excludes those currently on the court, who were appointed to lifetime terms, Reuters reports. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna says it  would save the country a lot of agony and help lower the temperature over fights for the court that go to the fault lines of cultural issues.  Recent polls have shown large majorities in favor of introducing term limits, which are already required on the Supreme Courts of every state except Rhode Island. The bill would allow each president to nominate two justices per four-year term. After their terms expired, justice would became  senior  and would be allowed to return to service on lower courts, as numerous former SCOTUS justices have done, including David Souter. This would allow term limits to be introduced without changing the Constitution, writes Gabe Roth In a USA Today op-ed. Roth is executive director of the nonpartisan Fix the Court group. While Democrats probably won't be able to stop President Trump nominating a replacement for Ginsburg,  they can join with their conservative colleagues who have long embraced the concept of term limits and ensure that never again will a superannuated bench determine the direction of our country,  he writes.",New Bill Limits SCOTUS Terms to 18 Years,New Bill Limits SCOTUS Terms to ____ Years,18,Copy( 18 ),0

It centers on Gao Yan, a 21-year-old who committed suicide in 1998 after claiming she was raped by Peking University professor Shen Yang, whom Gao said had then started a rumor that she had a mental illness. Shared recently by her former classmates—including one who wrote a widely read essay targeting Shen, who denies the allegations—Gao's story is seen as an example of the abuse suffered by women in China, per the Times, and universities including Peking, which Shen left in 2011, have responded with promises to do better.

The now-90-year-old was the sole winner of the jackpot in 2013, walking away with about $278 million after taxes. Flash forward to the present, and the Florida woman is embroiled in a lawsuit against her son over the handling of her fortune. The Florida Times-Union reports the suit was filed in 2018 but discussed in court this week. It targets Scott Mackenzie, who has power of attorney over her finances. Gloria alleges he prevented her from earning  tens of millions of dollars  she should have generated in gains by relying on an unqualified investment adviser who charged her $2 million in fees. The adviser is Harry Madden, co-host of a radio call-in show that doles out financial advice. Her suit alleges that in the 3.5 years Madden managed her money, she saw a return of less than 1%, reports the Jacksonville Business Journal. The suit says family members in 2014 shared with her a report detailing three past complaints against Madden, a move that had Scott threatening the family members with being cut out of Gloria's money. The suit initially filed by Gloria was dismissed in February; she filed an amended version the next month alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, and exploitation of a vulnerable adult.

Honestly, I feel angry on behalf of three great American novels,  says one.  I can safely say that anger and surprise/shock, and just sort of feeling this is an inexplicable decision on the part of the board—that really characterizes, I think, the way all three of us feel.

Despite his villainous reputation in the ring, Kowalski was a religious vegetarian who enjoyed classical music, philosophy and photography. He might have remained a  wrestling obscurity but for a 1954 incident when he accidentally severed an opponent's ear.  My shinbone grazed his cheek. His ear went flying across the ring,  Kowalski said of the incident decades later.  The referee was yelling at me, but I was watching the blood squirting out of his head.

"(Mar 27, 2020  1:05 PM CDT) Ten thousand steps a day: essential or overblown and unnecessary? The ubiquitous goal of fitness tracker users everywhere been called both, but a new study finds one thing is certain: Getting in more steps per day could lower your risk of an early death, even if you don't hit the  magic  10,000 number. Researchers looked at 4,840 participants aged 40 or older and found that higher step counts were associated with a lower risk of death from any cause over the course of a decade. A study co-author explains that people who generally hit around 4,000 to 5,000 steps per day  can get substantial benefit from increasing to 8,000 steps a day,  while those already hitting 8,000 could benefit from going up from there. The study took into account age, sex, health, smoking, and other factors, per the Guardian. Taking 8,000 steps per day was linked to a 50% lower risk of early death compared to taking 4,000 steps per day; those who took 12,000 steps per day had a 65% lower risk. Meanwhile, taking only 2,000 steps per day was associated with a 50% higher risk of early death compared to 4,000. Researchers looked at the intensity of the steps, as measured by steps taken per minute, and found it had no significant impact, though one expert not involved in the study says it's still possible that a faster pace would yield even greater benefits. Of course, since this study is being released during the COVID-19 pandemic, a UK expert who commented on it made sure to note that while you should walk, keep at least 6 feet away from others.",There's a Benefit to Hitting 12K Steps a Day,There's a Benefit to Hitting ____K Steps a Day,12,"Paraphrase( 12,000 , K )",1

The family was ordered out of the car at gunpoint, and while Gilliam was questioned by police, the four girls, ages 6, 12, 14, and 17, were made to lie prone on the ground, the 12-year-old and 17-year-old handcuffed. In a video shot by a bystander, which has since gone viral on Twitter, the children can be heard crying and screaming as they remain on the ground, with police officers standing around them. One officer finally helps the two handcuffed kids sit up; the other two kids are also allowed to sit. Vanessa Wilson, Aurora's interim police chief, says in a statement cited by the Washington Post that the officers were just doing what they were trained to do during a  high-risk stop,  but that  we must allow our officers to have discretion and to deviate from this process when different scenarios present themselves.  She adds she's told her team  to look at new practices and training  and called the family to apologize. The police note that adding to the confusion was the fact that Gilliam's car had been stolen earlier in the year.  [It] makes me very mad, because I am not anti-police,  Jenni Wurtz, who shot the video, tells Denver7.  I'm anti what happened.  Meanwhile, Teriana Thomas, Gilliam's 14-year-old niece who was seen in the video, says she's lost trust in the police.  It's like they don't care,  she tells KUSA.

"(May 6, 2013  10:41 AM CDT) An unsolved poisoning case has enthralled China, 19 years after the fact, and now more than 112,000 people have signed a petition asking the White House to investigate and deport a former suspect who is said to have moved to the US. Zhu Ling was a chemistry student at a top Chinese university when she was poisoned with Thallium in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor explains. She survived, but is now almost blind, paralyzed, and suffering from brain damage. Her case attracted quite a bit of attention at the time owing to the fact that she was young, smart, and attractive; it was never solved, and now a recent, similar poisoning has re-ignited interest. Police investigated Zhu's roommate, Sun Wei, who was said to have access to Thallium, but she was never charged due to a lack of evidence. Many speculated, however, that evidence was actually covered up because Sun's family was politically connected. She changed her name and is thought to live in the US now; in 2005, she even issued a statement declaring her innocence, the New Republic adds. The case was brought back to the forefront of public attention last month, when a student was arrested for fatally poisoning his university roommate. A journalist who has followed the case doubts the petition will do any good, but the Chinese government has definitely taken notice: Censors were briefly removing social media posts about the case, but now even state media are calling for further investigation.",China Wants US Help With 19-Year-Old Poisoning Mystery,China Wants US Help With ____-Year-Old Poisoning Mystery,19,Copy( 19 ),0

Thousands gathered near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the AP reports, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his historic  I Have a Dream  address. They gathered on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man—29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha last Sunday—sparking days of protests and violence.

"(Dec 26, 2016  2:59 PM) Neighbors of property where for years Dartmouth College disposed of mice and other small animals used in science experiments say they fear pollution has contaminated their groundwater. The site has contaminated the water of at least one family, Richard and Debbie Higgins, who blame a variety of health problems on it, including rashes, hair and skin loss, and dizziness. Even their dogs were affected, they say, with one urinating blood and another vomiting.  We have been drinking the water for years and we had no idea, absolutely no idea,  Debbie Higgins tells the AP. Few residents even knew the half-acre plot on Rennie Farm was used from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from  tracer experiments,  in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medical classes. Dartmouth cleaned the site up in 2011, removing 40 tons of carcasses and soil from unlined pits that were legal at the time they were dug. That led to the discovery of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive materials and evidence that at least one chemical used in experiments, suspected carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, had leaked into groundwater. It was found to have contaminated the Higginses' well 800 feet away at twice the state standard. Dartmouth apologized in September, established a neighborhood advisory panel and sampled 110 drinking wells; no others have tested positive.  We are committed to protecting the health of our neighbors, addressing their concerns, and communicating regularly,  a college rep said of the cleanup, which so far has cost $8.4 million. But some want more soil removed, while others want Dartmouth to compensate them for their dropping property values—demands the college says it is considering. The Higginses say their health problems have mostly disappeared since the switch to bottled water. But they want the college to move them away.

There is a 60% chance that  at least one country (and probably more) will leave  the euro in 2012, the head of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says. He adds that Greece's departure seems  pretty certain  and Italy will  more likely than not  follow suit, the Telegraph reports.

Along the way, the think tank says, French and German banking systems could seek bailouts and even be nationalized, the Financial Post reports.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,175 points—the largest single-day point drop in its history—to close at 24,345, per the AP. And it could been have been ever rougher: At one point in the afternoon, the index was down nearly 1,600 points. The other major indexes didn't fare much better. The S&P 500, the benchmark for many index funds, fell 113 points, or 4.1%, to 2,648, and the Nasdaq fell 273, or 3.8%, to 6,967. The Dow's loss amounted 4.6%. Two big factors: The Wall Street Journal blames investor fears about rising inflation and the increasing likelihood that the Fed will again raise interest rates.

Semen from two different men was found on the body of 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge, reports the BBC, but analysis revealed that while both sets matched DNA pulled from a cigarette butt found nearby—indicating that the suspects shared a smoke, notes the Bangkok Post—neither was a match for fellow victim David Miller, 24; his British roommate; or 11 Burmese migrants who had been questioned.

This week, Snohomish County police announced the arrest of William Earl Talbott, 55, in the 1987 murders of Canadians Jay Cook, 20, and Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18. The Washington investigators used a process similar to the one used to crack the notorious Golden State killer case, uploading DNA taken from the crime scene to GEDmatch, a public genealogy site. The suspect’s DNA profile led them to family members of the suspect who had shared their DNA information on the site. Based on the suspect’s DNA profile, a genetic genealogist was able to create an extensive family tree using information from the site, as well as other publicly available and social media sites. Once the detectives had their suspect, they still needed to get an exact match to his DNA, so they followed him and eventually collected a cup he had used. GEDmatch users have mixed feelings about investigators mining the site for clues. Some view it as a violation of privacy.  This is really tough,  an ethicist told the Times about the Golden State Killer case.  He was a horrible man and it is good that he was identified, but does the end justify the means?  But others applaud the results. For Lee Cook, the mother of Jay Cook, the value is clear, while the loss never diminishes.  Jay … would be 51 now,  she says.

He filed a lawsuit Thursday against Disney along with ABC Television, Buena Vista Television, Touchstone Television Productions, Disney Educational Productions, Disney Movie Club, and Buena Vista Home Entertainment alleging that they engaged in  an ongoing, deliberate conspiracy to deceive Mr. Nye and the [other owners of the series], and deprive them of their rightly owed share of the net profits from the [Bill Nye the Science Guy] series and derivative works.  Courthouse News has the full details, but basically, Nye and his co-plaintiffs are accusing Disney, et al, of taking steps to  skew the profits calculation in its favor,  per Variety, including improperly deducting foreign taxes and in some cases falsifying information entirely. Nye's show was developed in 1992 for Seattle's PBS affiliate, and the following year, the owners of the show made a deal with Buena Vista Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television) to promote and distribute the show while it was also still broadcast on PBS. In exchange, the owners were supposed to get half of Disney's net revenue, of which Nye would then get one third (the suit claims the full amount owed to all plaintiffs is $28 million). But in 2008, Nye got suspicious after getting a check for the year prior and then, months later, being asked to return most of that money due to a mistake the company made in a calculation.

The Democratic candidate has spent $63,000 with the network for five days' worth of ads targeting Sunshine State markets starting Thursday. But while it's a smart pre-election purchase in terms of viewership (the Weather Channel is likely to see a surge of watchers as the storm progresses), it could backfire if voters think Clinton is exploiting a dangerous situation for political benefit. (Politico notes other candidates, including Donald Trump, have also bought Weather Channel ads in 2016.

"(Aug 12, 2017  4:49 PM CDT) The FDA is investigating after five people have died since 2016 following an anti-obesity procedure involving silicone balloons, the Washington Post reports. The procedure, which is FDA-approved, involves inserting one or two silicone balloons into the stomach through the mouth and filling them with liquid until they are about the size of a grapefruit. The balloons are left in the stomach for up to six months with the idea being they leave less room for food. All five deaths occurred within a month of the procedure, and three of them happened within three days of the procedure. However, the FDA says it hasn't determined if the deaths were, in fact, caused by the silicone balloons or the procedure to insert them. Four of the deaths are being investigated in connection with the Orbera Intragastic Balloon System by Apollo Endosurgery; the fifth death is in connection to the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System by ReShape Medical Inc., CNN reports.  There is no responsibility that we take more seriously than patient safety,  ReShape says in a statement. Apollo notes that even with the deaths, its procedure has a fatality rate of less than 0.01%. According to NBC News, Apollo says it reported the deaths to the FDA itself.

People can decide for themselves whether  they want the 'wise' 45-year-old or the 'inexperienced' 32-year-old,  he writes.  It may be true that in the conventional sense you become wiser with age, perhaps to deal with today’s problems we need youthful enthusiasm and a willingness to challenge the status quo and take risks.  Forget the historical figures such as Jesus or Alexander the Great who would be deemed unfit to run. Just look at what the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs accomplished before the age of 30, let alone 35.

"(Nov 9, 2017  5:11 PM) Irv Refkin enlisted in the Army in 1940, at age 19, and was sent to Canada after basic training to learn about explosives. But once there, a senior officer with whom he clashed sent him to Britain without notice. Shortly after arriving—the British military still thought he was Canadian, and the US Army hadn't realized he was missing yet—he found himself parachuting into occupied France amid World War II, thanks to his demolitions knowledge and his ability to speak German. That's how Refkin became what the New York Times calls an  accidental spy,  and once the US actually entered the war, he carried out special assignments for his own country in addition to the three missions he had already completed for the British behind enemy lines. The 96-year-old, who has been called one of the war's most successful secret agents, died Thursday at his home in San Diego. Refkin, who was born in Milwaukee and raised in a German Lutheran orphanage after his parents, Jewish immigrants from Russia, were killed in a car accident, was ultimately awarded the Bronze Star and the Office of Strategic Services Society's Distinguished Service Award. During the war, he was said to have assassinated targets in Nazi Germany and smuggled explosives to the French Resistance, among other daring feats that also took him to Italy, the Soviet Union, and even South Africa. Last year, he recalled to the AP why he dressed as a German corporal during one mission:  Nobody looked at a corporal. You carry a garbage bag, put some smelly stuff in it, and they wave you right through. Nobody pays any attention to the guy emptying the ashtrays.

"(Apr 4, 2012  11:30 AM CDT) Federal regulators have filed their first action related to the momentous, crisis-sparking collapse of Lehman Brothers, but it won't amount to much. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a civil case against JPMorgan Chase, accusing it of overextending credit to Lehman, the New York Times reports. But JPMorgan settled the complaint without admitting wrongdoing, and will pay a fine of just $20 million—relative chump change for an outfit of JPMorgan's size.  The firm cooperated with the investigation and is pleased to have resolved this matter with the CFTC,  said JPMorgan in a statement. Regulators say JPMorgan counted customer money when determining how much money it could lend Lehman, which is against the law. Moreover, the Times notes that the customer funds were held in a JPMorgan account, so it should have known that it wasn't Lehman's money. The bank is also accused of withholding other customer funds from authorities. JPMorgan played a key role in Lehman's collapse by demanding more than $8 billion in collateral a week earlier, something Lehman's estate has filed a lawsuit over.",JPMorgan Pays $20M Slap on Wrist Over Lehman,JPMorgan Pays $____M Slap on Wrist Over Lehman,20,Copy( 20 ),0

But when he tried to spread the wealth locally, offering $14,000 to the Prosser School District and the Boys and Girls Club, his donation was refused, the AP reports. The school district—whose superintendent has been a vocal opponent of marijuana legalization in Washington—said no because it  would send an inconsistent message to … students,  as the Yakima Herald-Republic puts it. The district also says there's more pot now in its schools since legalization. And the executive director of the regional Boys and Girls Club said in a press release Monday that  due to the controversial nature of the origin of these particular funds … we believe that accepting this donation will distract our community from [our] mission.

But, as the New York Times reports, the defendant in the case, Johnson & Johnson, doesn’t anticipate having to shell out $4.69 billion to 22 women and their families who claim asbestos-contaminated talcum powder products caused their ovarian cancer.  The same judge has denied similar motions on prior verdicts in his court that were ultimately overturned by the appellate courts,  the company says.  We are confident this verdict will also be overturned on appeal.  In July, a jury awarded the plaintiffs in the case $4.14 billion in punitive damages and $550 million in compensatory damages. That lawsuit is far from isolated, the Times notes: There are some 12,000 plaintiffs in various talcum powder cases against Johnson & Johnson. The possibility of contaminated talc has been a concern at the company for decades, Reuters reports, but it has worked to keep those concerns secret. Based on recent reporting, drug inspectors in India have taken samples from a Johnson & Johnson factory in that country for testing, according to Fortune. In addition to linking contaminated talc to ovarian cancer, some have claimed that the product caused their mesothelioma. So far, per the Times, Johnson & Johnson has never paid awards to any plaintiffs. Sometimes, the company wins cases, and it appeals the majority of cases it loses. But the company is not unscathed: Following the Reuters report, per Fox Business, Johnson & Johnson lost more than $40 billion in value.

USA Today lays out Tipton's  untold story  in full, starting in 2005, when a co-worker at the Multi-State Lottery Association, where Tipton was a software programmer and head of IT security, uttered the sentence that changed everything.  Hey, did you put your secret numbers in there?,  accountant Gene Schaller asked, tipping Tipton off that since he wrote the code for the lottery's numbers-generating software, there was nothing stopping him from placing code in there to get the numbers to go the way he wanted. And that's exactly what Tipton did, finagling the system so that he and his brother, Tommy, could win big time. The Tiptons were arrested in 2015 for fraud, per Time, and pleaded guilty to felony charges; Tommy got 75 days behind bars, while Eddie, now 54, is still serving up to 25 years in prison, with a chance for parole in three years or so, per his lawyers. But it's the story of what happened in between that first conversation with Schaller and his sentencing that's most intriguing, including how he was hired by the lottery system with a criminal background (he'd been involved with a warehouse theft and also in stealing software from Sears as a teen), how he'd actually tried to clue his employers in to the vulnerability of their software, and how the Tiptons' first big win was helped along by … a search for Bigfoot.

Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal—who owns stakes in Twitter and other Western companies and has an estimated worth of $18.7 billion—was arrested as part of a sweeping roundup of royals, officials, and others in Saudi Arabia orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The arrests are being characterized by the government as a crackdown on corruption, but most believe they are instead a consolidation of power by Prince Mohammed. A senior Saudi official says Prince al-Waleed faces allegations of bribery, money laundering, and extortion. Prince al-Waleed denies any wrongdoing, sources say. Prince al-Waleed has spent the last few weeks at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, which has been turned into a prison. Sources say the Saudi government is demanding at least $6 billion from him to be released. Many of the arrested have already paid for their freedom—though $6 billion is one of the highest amounts being sought, sources say. Some close to Prince al-Waleed say he doesn't want to pay because it would be an admission of guilt and hurt his business. Instead, sources say he's trying to get the government to accept a large share of his company, which is valued at $8.7 billion or so. People close to Prince al-Waleed say his arrest was likely a shock to him, as he had been supportive of Prince Mohammed's plans for reform in Saudi Arabia.

Bruno Dey is 93 and in poor health, per Deutsche Welle, but prosecutors say that in the height of World War II, he was a 17-year-old SS sharpshooter capable of climbing up and down the watch towers at the Stutthof death camp in what is now Poland. Some 120,000 prisoners were held there, and more than half would die. Dey, whose name was found on SS clothing in Stutthof’s archives in 2016, is charged as an accessory to murder in 5,230 deaths—5,000 attributed to hostile conditions, 200 to gassing, and 30 to a fatal shot—between 1944 and 1945, reports the BBC. His case is being heard in juvenile court due to his age at the time. Though he's admitted to seeing  emaciated figures  and  people who had suffered,  Dey denies that he  knowingly supported  the murders of Jewish prisoners or  carried out execution orders,  as prosecutors allege, per Deutsche Welle and the Local. As Dey sees it, there was little the teen could do to stand up to Adolf Hitler's regime when he was sent to the camp rather than the war front, owing to a heart disease. As Dey's health is poor, there's a risk his trial will be halted.

"(Jun 25, 2015  1:30 PM CDT) A new study suggests a relatively easy way to gauge whether people are more likely to wind up with an Alzheimer's diagnosis as far as 18 years down the road: memory and thinking tests. A study out of the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago tracked more than 2,000 people with an average age of 73 who did not have an Alzheimer's diagnosis when the study began, explains HealthDay News. They took mental skills tests every three years over a nearly two-decade span, and it turns out that those who scored low on the tests had a greater chance of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. At the time they took the tests, though, they showed no obvious symptoms of looming trouble, save for those low test scores. What's more, the eventual Alzheimer's patients showed progressively worse results in the testing.  The changes in thinking and memory that precede obvious symptoms of Alzheimer's disease begin decades before,  says Kumar Rajan, author of the study in Neurology. He says the findings should be interpreted generally—that low test scores shouldn't be used to predict an individual's risk. But such tests might someday become a routine part of health maintenance for those in middle age, notes Time. For those who fare poorly, it might be wise to try to take preventative efforts. Rajan plans to next study what some of those efforts might be, perhaps even simple things such as crossword puzzles or increased social interaction.

Driver Scott Dixon walked away Sunday from the nightmare crash captured in this video. (Replay starts about 47 seconds in.) It also can be seen in this tweeted video. The LA Times reports that the accident began when driver Jay Howard lost control of his vehicle a little more than a quarter into the 200-lap race. He collided with Dixon, whose car was sent flying through the air before smashing into an inner retaining wall. Though Dixon’s vehicle was demolished, both drivers survived the fiery accident and were released after a check-up at the track's medical center. Afterward, Dixon said he was  a little bit beaten up  and  glad everybody was OK,  calling the incident  definitely a wild ride.  The race continued on, with Takuma Sato later becoming the first Japanese driver ever to finish first, reports the AP.

"(Jan 18, 2015  2:15 PM) Today, cancers are  becoming either preventable or effectively curable,  a researcher notes—and that means that by 2050, hardly anyone under 80 will die of such diseases, a study says.  This is a projection of what is already happening,  the researcher, David Taylor, says, according to Metro.  Lifestyle changes,   protective technologies,  and improved therapies will pave the way, the study notes. Things could move even faster if people follow advice to take aspirin daily, according to the study—though some have questioned that advice, given aspirin's link to ulcers and stomach bleeding, Yahoo UK reports. But another researcher who led the study is standing firm in comments to the Daily Mail.  Taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important single thing we can do to reduce cancer, after stopping smoking and reducing obesity, and will probably be much easier to implement,  says Prof. Jack Cuzick.  If everyone aged between 50 and 65 took aspirin daily for ten years, there would be a 9% reduction in the number of cancers, strokes, and heart attacks in men, and around 7% in women.  (In less positive news, research has recently suggested that bad luck plays a huge role in whether we get cancer.)","Within Decades, Cancer Will Hardly Kill Anyone Under 80","Within Decades, Cancer Will Hardly Kill Anyone Under ____",80,Copy( 80 ),0

Okanogan County Sheriff Tony Hawley says Uriel Hyland died and parents Jacob Hyland, 31, and Jamie Hyland, 26, were severely burned while trying to escape the Cold Springs Fire, Fox reports. Relatives tells KHQ that the family, who live in the Seattle area, were trapped by the fire while visiting a property they'd inherited in Okanogan, 150 miles northwest of Spokane. Their burned vehicle was discovered Tuesday after they were reported missing. Rescuers found the family early Wednesday on the banks of the Columbia River. The boy was dead at the scene and his parents were hospitalized in critical condition with third-degree burns, authorities say. The sheriff's office says the family was apparently forced to abandon the truck, which was found near their property. The Cold Springs Fire, which started Sunday and exploded in size Monday, has burned 337,000 acres together with the nearby Pearl Hill Fire. Hawley says the cause of the fire is still unclear, but if it turns out to be arson, the child's death will be treated as a possible homicide.  To even be talking about the death of a 1-year-old is just devastating,  the sheriff tells the Spokesman-Review. Elsewhere in the region, authorities say a fast-moving wildfire in Lyons, Ore., killed 12-year-old Wyatt Tofte, who was found dead along with his dog, KGW reports.

Peerless Spirit  Scotch whisky, which comes in a decanter inspired by Lalique perfume bottles, is the sixth and final entry in the Macallan in Lalique  Six Pillars Collection,  per a press release, which also announces the jaw-dropping price for this single-malt  masterpiece,  of which only 450 decanters have been made: $35,000. With notes of cracked black pepper, dark chocolate, cloves, cinnamon, and honey, the whisky is said to be one of the oldest ever released by the Macallan estate. And the story behind the decanter's design shows a bottle just as exquisitely crafted: Lalique's creative director created the bottle to resemble a  single peerless drop  of the high-end liquor, influenced by Rene Lalique's mold-blown, pinched glass method. It's no easy task to bring whisky into its golden years. As Maxim explains, depending on the barrel and the climate, oxidation and exposure to wood can ruin a perfect batch before it even hits 50—making this 65-year-old version  a unicorn that's been perfected by time.   This ... final release continues to showcase the unwavering commitment of both the masters of Lalique and the Macallan to create beautiful and desirable objets d'art,  Macallan's brand director says. It's not the first time the distillery has made big-bucks news: In 2014, a 6-liter Macallan M Imperiale Lalique decanter (one of only four made) sold at auction for a record $628,000, per Forbes.

What the Journal claims the silence was in connection with: an alleged consensual sexual encounter Trump had with Stephanie Clifford, who goes by Stormy Daniels in films, in July 2006. Trump wed Melania in 2005. The Journal alleges the payment was made by Michael Cohen in October 2016 upon Clifford's signing of a nondisclosure agreement. A then-27-year-old Clifford and Trump met at a celeb golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, and the Journal points out that it previously reported via sources that Clifford had been considering an appearance on Good Morning America around the time the payment was allegedly made. Backing up the allegations: Jacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of the Slate Group, tells the New York Times he interviewed Clifford in August and October 2016 and was told of the affair and the agreed-upon $130,000 payment. He said she was considering going public because she had yet to receive the payment and feared it wasn't coming.

Miller was a key exec at Columbia Records in the pre-rock 'n' roll era, making hits with singers Rosemary Clooney, Patti Page, Johnny Mathis, and Tony Bennett. Sing Along With Mitch started as a series of records, then became a popular NBC show starting in early 1961. Miller's stiff-armed conducting style and signature goatee became famous.

Police are saying very little about the letter's contents, but they hope the author will reach out again and perhaps end the mystery of what happened to Bernard  Bunny  Ross, reports the Bangor Daily News.

In its report, the Washington Post notes that while the 20-year sentence she is due to serve  brought an end to Patel’s trial ... it may be only the beginning of the public debate about the details of her case.  The case began in July 2013, when Patel went to St. Joseph Hospital in Mishawaka, Indiana, bleeding and with a protruding umbilical cord, a doctor testified. Patel later revealed that she had a miscarriage and had left the fetus, which she says was stillborn, in a dumpster. Prosecutors argued the baby was born alive, hence the child neglect charge. The feticide charge (which PRI frames as  normally used against those who harm pregnant women ) was based on text messages Patel sent indicating she had taken drugs purchased from China in an attempt to abort her fetus, reports the AP; tests showed no such drugs in her or the fetus, however. She was in February found guilty on both counts, though many have argued the two charges were  legally contradictory.  PRI reports that the gestational age of the fetus was fiercely debated at the trial. Her defense argued it was at most 24 weeks old, and would not have survived even with medical intervention; NBC News reports prosecutors argued she was 25 weeks along in their opening statement, and the aforementioned doctor testified that he thought the fetus was as many as 30 weeks.

"(Oct 14, 2015  5:46 PM CDT) Three young sisters died Tuesday in a freak accident on a family farm in rural Canada, the Edmonton Journal reports. The girls—11-year-old twins Dara and Jana and 13-year-old Catie—were smothered by canola seed in the back of a truck, though the details of their deaths remain hazy. A deputy fire chief tells CBC News the girls somehow fell into the canola seed while the truck was being unloaded. But the Journal reports the girls were playing on the truck while it was being filled with seed and were buried. Regardless, family members and neighbors pulled the girls out and attempted CPR without success, according to the Calgary Sun.  Our kids died living life on the farm,  the Alberta family says in a statement.  We do not regret raising and involving our kids … on our farm. It was our life.  The family's pastor spoke on behalf of the family, telling the Journal:  They are obviously devastated. There is just a deep sense of loss and sadness.  Neighbors were planning to finish the grieving family's autumn harvest for them, and nine combines and several trucks were already on the job Wednesday. One man sent up a drone to take a photo of the group effort.  I want Roger to see this,  he said, referring to the girls' father.  I want him to know how everyone is here to help him.

The last thing in it was that we go out to dinner and leave an awesome tip,  brother Seth explains to NPR.  And he said, 'I'm not talking about 25%. I mean, $500 for pizza.'  Seth and his parents raised money from friends and family to carry out the 30-year-old's wish, and made a video about it—which went viral. More people started donating to the cause, giving more than $60,000 to date, so Seth set out on a quest to leave $500 tips in each of the 50 states. He's blogging about the odyssey on Aaron's Last Wish. The 54th tip was handed out last week in Indianapolis, reports ABC News, which has video of the emotional waitress's reaction. Indiana is the 17th state Seth has hit, and he says the experience  never gets old.  He's been handing out tips on a weekly basis, and is planning a four-month trip to hit the rest of the states.

Viktor Bout's sentence was the mandatory minimum he faced, though federal sentencing guidelines had called for life in prison. In court, Bout interrupted a prosecutor who said he agreed to sell weapons to kill Americans, shouting in English:  It's a lie!  The sentencing came four years after Bout's arrest in Thailand, where he was held before his extradition to the US for trial in late 2010. The government had portrayed Bout, the inspiration for an arms dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film Lord of War, as one of the world's worst villains, capable of empowering dictators in war-torn countries by supplying weapons that they could turn on their own people. The defense had countered that Bout was a political prisoner, a victim of a sting operation.",'Merchant of Death' Arms Trafficker Gets 25 Years,'Merchant of Death' Arms Trafficker Gets ____ Years,25,Copy( 25 ),0

We spent 14 months scavenging around the industry, looking at more suppliers than we ever have.  The number actually topped 30, when the fast-food company usually reviews two to five growers. The procurement took another three years, but Wendy's says it will finally have enough berries to decorate a seasonal salad coming to 6,500 North American restaurants. Will the pursuit pay off? Probably, suggests a study of 1,000. Above limiting sugar, salt, or fat, consumers say adding more produce is the most important dietary change they're making, reports the Wall Street Journal. That may partly explain the consumer shift from fast-food to fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle that prepare fresh food. Wendy's and others are hoping to compete. McDonald's is offering kale salads, Del Taco is promoting its use of fresh avocado, and Chick-fil-A is adding what it says is fresh, locally sourced produce, like red cabbage and carrots, to its chicken wrap. In Wendy's case, adding blackberries to the menu posed its  most difficult supply-chain challenge ever,  reports the Journal. As most blackberries are sold to grocery stores, Wendy's had to enlist two growers to plant extra blackberry bushes to meet the company's demand; the bushes take three years to mature. The salad will hit stores next summer.",Why Wendy's Spent 3 Years Looking for Blackberries,Why Wendy's Spent ____ Years Looking for Blackberries,3,Trans( three ),1

The SEC says gambler William Walters received tips and business information about Dean Foods Co. from Thomas Davis, former head of Dean Foods, between 2008 and 2012. The SEC says Walters called Mickelson, who owed him money, in 2012 and urged him to trade Dean Foods stock. The SEC says Mickelson did so the next day, buying 240,000 shares and making a profit of $931,000, per ESPN. He then used that money to pay Walters back his IOU a few months later, the SEC says. Mickelson's attorney told ESPN on Thursday that the golfer, who wasn't charged criminally, has made a deal with the SEC that involves him returning all money made from that trade—what the SEC refers to as  all ill-gotten gains in the form of illicit trading profits,  per USA Today.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said a 16-year-old Palestinian drew a knife on officers in Jerusalem when they stopped him to ask for identification after a bystander said he was behaving suspiciously. She said the officers shot and killed the teenager after he tried to stab them. The incident took place near where two Palestinian men boarded a bus earlier in the week and began shooting and stabbing passengers, killing two. Elsewhere on Saturday, Israel's military said an Israeli pedestrian shot and killed a Palestinian who tried to stab him in the West Bank city of Hebron, a frequent flashpoint where a few hundred Jewish settlers live in close proximity to tens of thousands of Palestinians. The military said the Palestinian was shot dead before he could harm the man. Later, police said a Palestinian woman stabbed a female officer at a border police base in Hebron before the officer shot her dead. The officer's hand was lightly wounded. Over the past month, eight Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 39 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 18 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops.The violence erupted a month ago over the Jewish New Year, fueled by rumors that Israel was plotting to take over Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine and a key national symbol for the Palestinians.

Earlier this week, it was announced two stylists who worked at the same Great Clips site in Springfield—which reopened earlier this month when restrictions on salons were lifted by Gov. Mike Parson—were found to have tested positive for COVID-19, possibly exposing nearly 150 staff members and customers. Both staffers reportedly worked for days while showing symptoms, though both wore masks, as did customers. Now the company and police say  repeated threats  have forced the closure of multiple local Great Clips locations, per NBC News.  To protect the safety of everyone, the local franchisees made the decision to temporarily close salons in the Springfield area,  Great Clips Inc. said in a statement. Springfield Police Department spokeswoman Jasmine Bailey tells the AP that a salon employee received the first threat via Facebook on Saturday. A second threat came in to a salon on Wednesday via a phone call. Bailey says both warnings  were threatening to shut the place down  over the stylists' possibly exposing customers. Meanwhile, an attorney for one of the stylists tells KY3 his client sought a test when she developed symptoms but says she wasn't told by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department not to return to work as she awaited her results. The health department says all patients getting a test have to sign an agreement saying they won't go back to work while waiting for results, though it wouldn't discuss her case due to privacy issues.

Per CNN, investigator Kok Soo Chon announced the long-awaited findings at a news conference near Kuala Lumpur on Monday.

The Times kept David Rohde’s abduction secret out of concern for his safety and had been in sporadic contact with him and his captors. Last night, he and a local reporter climbed over the wall of the compound where they were held and were helped to safety by a Pakistani soldier.  They just walked over the wall of the compound,  said Rohde’s wife. They were airlifted to the US’ Bagram base near Kabul. Rohde, 41, won a Pulitzer while in captivity for coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan last year. He was taken while traveling to interview a Taliban leader.

"(May 5, 2010  4:00 AM CDT) Ernie Harwell, the only baseball broadcaster ever traded for a player, has died aged 92 after a long fight with cancer. The beloved sportscaster spent 55 years broadcasting major league games, 42 of them with the Detroit Tigers. The transplanted Southerner, rated as one of the best baseball broadcasters of all time, became known as the voice of Detroit during his decades of doing play-by-play for the Tigers, the Detroit Free Press notes in a glowing tribute. Harwell started out as a sportswriter aged 16 in 1934 and moved to sportscasting with the Atlanta Crackers. After a stint in the Marines during World War II, he ended up in the big leagues when the Brooklyn Dodgers acquired him from the Crackers for catcher Cliff Dapper. He moved to Detroit in 1960 and was still broadcasting the full 162-game schedule into his eighties. After learning he had just months to live, Harwell said death was just the next big adventure.

Authorities think one man killed six adults and two children in a domestic dispute before committing suicide. Edmonton police found the first victim, a middle-aged woman, inside a home while responding to a weapons complaint at the address yesterday evening. Shortly after midnight, after getting multiple calls about a potential suicidal male at a separate address, they found the bodies of seven more victims—identified only as three women, two men, a boy, and a girl, reports the AP. (Police had gone to the home earlier, about 8:30pm, but left after getting no answer and seeing nothing suspicious.

Scratching off a 1 on the $20 ticket means a $250,000 jackpot, but when the former air-conditioner repairman tried to claim $500,000 after getting two 1's, he was told a printing error had made a 12 and an 18 look like 1's, with only smudges remaining of the latter digits, KOB reports. Wines was offered $100 in lottery tickets instead. Lottery officials say the mix-up was caused by a clogged ink dispenser at the printer, which was supposed to pull all the tickets affected but missed the one Wines bought.

"(Jun 1, 2017  5:59 PM CDT) Experts say one of the biggest icebergs in recorded history—it would be about the size of Delaware—is  very close  to separating from Antarctica, USA Today reports. According to the BBC, a 124-mile-long crack on the Larsen C Ice Shelf grew more than 10 miles over just six days to end the month of May. The crack, which had been running parallel to the edge of the ice shelf, also took a right turn toward the shelf's edge, CNN reports. The crack is now only eight miles from the edge of the shelf, and it appears there's nothing left stopping a major chunk of the shelf from calving free. When the iceberg does split off, it will take 10% of the Larsen C Ice Shelf with it. The iceberg will be more than 1,900 square miles in size and 1,150 feet thick, Gizmodo reports. The loss will make Larsen C less stable, and one researcher says the entire shelf could fall apart  in a day or two.  The Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves already broke up after similar events in past years. The loss of the ice shelf can increase the speed of glaciers flowing from the land to the ocean and therefore the speed of rising sea levels. Researchers are also concerned that larger and larger ice shelves appear to be breaking up.

Per a Dallas Craigslist ad, Bullet, who's said to be  tame and housebroken,  is up for grabs for about $6,000, as long as the purchaser allows her to continue interacting with humans. And that requirement is because right now, Bullet is basically part of the Shoeve family, even coming inside the house when she feels like it.

Shoeve notes in the ad that Bullet also loves to  chase and spar  with her rider lawn mower and truck, just like a  precious gigantic dog —though Shoeve does issue a caveat that Bullet shouldn't be left in the house by herself or alone with kids:  She is still a buffalo, after all.  So far, a camp for autistic kids is mulling over the purchase, and Shoeve and her family are enjoying their final days with their bison buddy.

But a new study suggests this wasn't all for naught, offering  fresh evidence that aggressive and unprecedented shutdowns ... were necessary to halt the exponential spread  of the virus, despite the economic upheaval they caused, per the Washington Post. The research published in the journal Nature looked at how more than 1,700 non-pharmaceutical interventions—school and business closings, working from home, etc.—affected virus spread in six countries: the United States, China, Italy, France, Iran, and South Korea. Based on the examined data, scientists estimated that among those nations, 530 million coronavirus infections were prevented by the shutdowns, with 60 million of those in the US. In China, the result of their own shutdowns was nearly five times that, preventing about 285 million cases. One notable finding, per the Post: Closing schools didn't seem to have any significant effect on curbing infections, though the study's authors say that needs to be studied more. Banning large gatherings similarly didn't make a big dent in curbing infections in China, the US, South Korea, and France, though this move did make an impact in Iran and Italy. A different new study, also published in Nature, found that in 11 European countries,  major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission,  cutting infection rates by an average of 82% and saving about 3.1 million lives.

To people of color, the 'War on Drugs' has arguably been the single most devastating, dysfunctional social policy since slavery,  the resolution reads. Besides the more humanitarian reasons, the group offers economic backup as well.  Huge sums of our national treasury are wasted on this failed public policy,  the resolution states. The mandate also lists Portugal and Switzerland as being examples of countries that have  dramatically reduced the incidence of death, disease, crime, and addiction  by attacking the drug issue through other means other than criminalization.

"(Sep 13, 2017  10:00 AM CDT) It's been more than three years since Payton Leutner was stabbed 19 times by two friends in a Wisconsin park in the  Slender Man  stabbing, and this week a jury hears testimony to decide if one of her attackers was mentally competent at the time. Opening statements began Tuesday in the case of 15-year-old Anissa Weier, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Weier's defense is now tasked with convincing 10 of 16 jurors (12 assigned and four alternates) that Weier was delusional at the time of the May 2014 attack and went after Leutner because Weier feared the internet character Slender Man. Weier has pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree homicide, meaning she admits she took part in the attack; this trial will determine if she can be held criminally responsible, which will impact whether she heads to prison or a mental hospital.  Anissa's broken mind caused her to lose touch with reality,  Weier's defense attorney told jurors Tuesday, adding she'd been a loner who developed a  delusional belief system  with co-defendant Morgan Geyser, believing they could become Slender Man's proxies by murdering Leutner, per the AP. Waukesha County Assistant DA Kevin Osborne refuted that, noting Weier had intended to carry out the attack herself but instead instructed Geyser to do it, which he sees as an indication she knew it was wrong. Weier's father took the stand as a defense witness and said while his daughter had gone through rough times during his divorce,  in my opinion, she was a normal child.  Geyser, who's been diagnosed with schizophrenia, has pleaded not guilty to being a party to attempted first-degree homicide and will go to trial Oct. 9.","After 3 Years, 'Slender Man' Trial Begins","After ____ Years, 'Slender Man' Trial Begins",3,Trans( three ),1

The IPO could now raise as much as $16 billion—dwarfing Google's $2 billion IPO in 2004—and become the third-largest initial stock offering in American history, after Visa and General Motors. The stock goes public Friday. The price hike helped raise other tech stock yesterday, although doubts remain about the company's long-term money-making potential—especially in light of GM's decision to stop running ads on the site.

"(Feb 2, 2015  8:56 AM) An Egyptian court today sentenced 183 people to death over the ransacking of a police station and the killing of 15 policemen after the 2013 ouster of President Mohamed Morsi. The verdict was the latest in a string of mass death sentences that have sparked local and international condemnation. The charges are related to the bloody August 2013 ransacking of a police station in the village of Kerdassah, near Cairo. The attackers killed 15 officers, including the police chief, and mutilated some of the bodies.The assault was believed to be revenge by Morsi loyalists for the government's crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt has officially declared a terrorist organization. Morsi, a longtime Brotherhood official, was ousted by the military in July 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Morsi supporters staged a pair of large public sit-in protests in Cairo, which were harshly broken up by police on August 14, 2013—killing hundreds of Brotherhood cadres. The attack on the Kerdassah police station began a few hours after the Brotherhood sit-ins were cleared. Today's verdict was issued by judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata, who has developed a reputation for harsh sentences against perceived government critics. He also sentenced three al-Jazeera journalists to jail terms ranging from 7-10 years; one of those journalists, Australian Peter Greste, was released and deported yesterday, while the other two remain in prison.",Egypt Hands Out 183 Death Sentences,Egypt Hands Out ____ Death Sentences,183,Copy( 183 ),0

Win Zaw Htun and Zaw Lin, who are both 22 years old, were found guilty on Thursday of murdering British tourists David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, the Telegraph reports. They were also found guilty of robbing the pair, whose bodies were discovered on a beach on the island of Koh Tao, and of raping Witheridge. Lawyers say they plan to appeal the verdict, which Human Rights Watch calls  profoundly disturbing  in light of allegations of police torture and questions surrounding the DNA evidence that was used to convict the two men, reports the AP. Family members who traveled from Britain for the trial say they believe that justice has been served and that Thai police carried out a thorough investigation.  David was hacked from behind, dragged into the sea, and left to die. That will live with us forever,  his brother, Michael, said outside the court, per the Guardian.

"(Sep 27, 2017  6:43 PM CDT) Russian investigators believe a couple may have killed, skinned, and eaten up to 30 people over the past two decades, even secretly feeding  canned human meat  to unsuspecting soldiers at the military academy where they worked, the Washington Post reports. According to the Moscow Times, a construction worker in the city of Krasnodar found a cellphone Sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's SIM card to 35-year-old Dmitry Baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among Russia's worst serial killers. While many details of the case are unknown or unconfirmed, authorities say the alleged murders date back to at least 1999, CNN reports. That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the BBC,  food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin  found in the apartment are being tested for human DNA. Authorities say Baksheev and his wife, Natalia Baksheeva, would knock their victims out with sedatives, though it's unclear how they chose their victims.

"(Jun 12, 2015  2:20 PM CDT) President Obama may have to choose between keeping a tropical paradise as pristine as ever and seeing it transformed into US military training grounds. The Pentagon is toying with the idea of turning Tinian and Pagan—small US territories in the Northern Mariana Islands—into a place to stage war 16 weeks a year. What locals (who are US citizens) think: Pagan's mayor says the people are 100% against the move, which some equate to an  invasion,  the Guardian reports. While Pagan has been uninhabited since a 1981 volcanic eruption, mayor Jerome Aldan says about 50 families aim to return to the 10-mile-long stretch of land. Tinian's 3,000 residents—some of whom own land already leased to the military—could be forced onto a 10-square-mile area. And the plan, which could be put into action by 2017, doesn't just affect people. Biologist Mike Hadfield describes Pagan as a  biological treasure trove  boasting rare fruit bats and tree snails. A rep for the Marine Corps in the Pacific told the Los Angeles Times last month,  We would protect it like it was our own.  (Hadfield's response:  Anyone who believes the US Marines and Navy when they say they'll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy. ) The weeks of war games could see major amphibious assaults, ground maneuvers, and the placement of bombing targets on Mt.

Myerson died Dec. 14 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif, officials say. The Bronx-born Myerson was hailed as a Jewish, feminist Jackie Robinson—a groundbreaker for her religion and sex—after parlaying her stunning 1945 Miss America victory into national celebrity. The 5-foot-10 dark-haired beauty, unlike her predecessors, accentuated her intelligence. Myerson landed a series of television jobs, from game show hostess to on-air reporter, before her appointment as New York City's chief consumer watchdog in 1969. The popular Myerson then helped Ed Koch win the 1977 mayoral race, deflecting rumors that he was gay. Koch later appointed her Cultural Affairs commissioner, but Myerson's carefully cultivated image crumbled in the mid-1980s when a city background check exposed her as an insanely jealous woman who harassed an ex-boyfriend and his new lover. She repeatedly invoked her right against self-incrimination in a 1986 corruption probe of a subsequent boyfriend, Carl Capasso, with purported mob ties. Myerson was later acquitted on charges of trying to fix Capasso's divorce case, but add a couple of shoplifting convictions, and the damage was done. Yet the Miss America Organization says Myerson will be remembered for her unwavering commitment to equality:  Bess used her Miss America title to fight anti-Semitism and racial bigotry as she traveled around the country,  the organization says.",Miss America Later Caught in Scandals Dead at 90,Miss America Later Caught in Scandals Dead at ____,90,Copy( 90 ),0

"(Jul 9, 2015  2:50 PM CDT) The  accrual of high-level evidence  indicates  that the supplements lack efficacy across a range of health outcomes for which their use is advocated.  That pronouncement, a conclusion that comes from an analysis of 24 studies based on randomized clinical trials and published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, is hardly a ringing endorsement. But as the Washington Post reports, we buy those supplements anyway, and lots of them: Americans spend roughly $1.2 billion each year on fish oil pills and associated products; one of the authors of that JAMA research told Reuters in 2013 that about 10% of Americans take them. They're touted for the good fatty acids—omega-3s—they contain. But while they're generally considered safe to take, it's pretty unclear whether they're beneficial for heart health. Writing for the Post, Peter Whoriskey astutely points out that even the National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association can't really make up their minds. The former endorses the supplements, then states  omega-3s in supplement form have not been shown to protect against heart disease  on its website; a scientific consultant with the NIH says the endorsement was supplied by a third-party contributor. As for the AHA, it advises people battling heart disease to ask their doctor about the supplements, but a former AHA president tells Whoriskey,  It would be a good time for that to be updated.  As for those 24 aforementioned studies, all but two showed no benefit. But Whoriskey notes it's possible there is some, and our experiments on heart disease patients just can't pick up on it because heart medications cloud things.

(Note to Chrysler: If you could have made this business model work, you wouldn't have needed the bailout.)

Chen sought medical costs of $250 and $81,000 in psychological damages, a figure the court deemed  excessive.

"(Oct 26, 2016  7:50 AM CDT) A third African country says it will leave the International Criminal Court as fears grow of a mass pullout from the body that pursues some of the world's worst atrocities. Gambia announced the decision on TV Tuesday, accusing the court of unfairly targeting Africa and calling it the  International Caucasian Court for the persecution and humiliation of people of color, especially Africans,  per the AP. The move comes after South Africa last week notified the UN secretary-general it would leave the court; withdrawal takes effect a year after the notification is received. Early last week, Burundi's president signed legislation to leave the court as well. The EU director for Human Rights Watch calls the decisions  shameful.  Gambia's decision is striking because the ICC's chief prosecutor is Gambian. However, the country's information minister says the court is involved in  the persecution of Africans, and especially their leaders,  rather than those in Western countries. He singled out former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Only Africans have been charged in the six ICC cases that are ongoing or about to begin, though preliminary investigations have opened elsewhere. Signatory countries have a legal obligation to arrest anyone sought by the tribunal, but some African states have allowed people wanted by the ICC, notably Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, to visit, and some say leaders ought to be immune from prosecution.",3 Countries to Quit International Criminal Court,____ Countries to Quit International Criminal Court,3,Trans( third ),1

The FBI assisted officers from Seattle and Bellevue in clearing out the area encompassing several blocks in the city's Capitol Hill section, widely known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, early Wednesday, per the Seattle Times. The outlet describes at least 100 officers dressed in body armor and wielding batons and other weapons moving through the area, accompanied by  tactical vehicles.  Mayor Jenny Durkan had issued an executive order declaring  an unlawful assembly requiring immediate action  just before 5am.

Dramatic video showed the home, north of Tampa in Pasco County, collapsing into the hole on Friday morning. The hole quickly grew to 200 feet wide—about two-thirds the length of a football field—and 50 feet deep. Pasco County Fire Chief Shawn Whited told reporters that no one was at the home when crews arrived just after 7:30am. Someone had called about a  depression  under a boat parked in the backyard of a home in Lake Padgett Estates in Land O'Lakes. Within minutes, he said,  the hole opened up,  and the boat fell in. Firefighters were able to get two dogs out of the home and retrieve some belongings before the first home started collapsing into the quickly-expanding hole. By early afternoon, the home next door also had been destroyed by the sinkhole. No injuries have been reported. Kevin Guthrie, Pasco County's assistant county administrator for public safety, said 10 other homes in the neighborhood have been tagged unsafe and the residents have been voluntarily evacuated.

Back in September, the University of Tennessee got wind that the boy, a student in Altamonte Springs, had broken down in tears after classmates made fun of the homemade UT T-shirt that he wore to represent the Tennessee Volunteers football team for college colors week. The school ended up turning his hand-drawn design into an actual shirt that it put up for sale through its VolShop website; it also offered the student a full scholarship.

The closely guarded cost was released last week after Rep. Randy Neugebauer requested the figures last year. Some $132 million of the total went to defend Fannie Mae, mostly over lawsuits and accounting probes that occurred before the subprime crisis; $24.2 million was spent on the defense of three of the mortgage firm’s ex-bosses, the New York Times finds. And the payments continue.  We need to be doing everything we can to minimize any further exposure to the taxpayers associated with these companies,  said Neugebauer, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee. The Times notes that corporations typically cover such legal fees, and Fannie and Freddie themselves spent millions to defend former execs before the takeover; but after the government moved to back the two companies, the Federal Housing Finance Agency agreed to keep footing the bill.

The FDA said four brands from RJ Reynolds failed to show that they don't raise new safety concerns: Camel Crush Bold, Pall Mall Deep Set, Pall Mall Deep Set Menthol, and Vantage Tech 13. In 2009 the FDA gained authority to regulate some aspects of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The agency can evaluate new tobacco products for their health risks and ban those that raise new or uncertain issues.

China’s about to school us all with its announcement that it’s making progress on a supersonic submarine that uses this technology, theoretically giving the underwater vessel the capability to zip along at the speed of sound, reports the South China Morning Post. A sub that can reach a top speed of 3,600mph could make it from Shanghai to San Francisco in 100 minutes, according to a California Institute of Technology report cited in the Morning Post. An engineering professor involved with the project says such technology could have future military, civilian transport, and water sports applications. Supercavitation technology works by surrounding an underwater vehicle such as a sub in an  air bubble  to cut down on water resistance against the surface area of the vessel. Two problems have previously hampered using this technology: The sub would have to be launched at more than 60mph to keep the air bubble intact, and steering inside the air bubble is extremely difficult. Chinese scientists claim they’ve almost got a handle on those two issues, though there are other problems they still have to tackle before such a high-tech submarine would be possible. For comparison, today’s fastest subs crawl through the surf at a mere 46mph, according to the Washington Post—which doubts that even a sub using supercavitation would ever reach 3,600mph, but notes that torpedoes using similar technology have hit 230mph.

But he insists the problem starts in the film business itself:  If the industry as a whole is not doing a great job in opening up its ranks, it's very hard for us to diversify our membership.  Another shocker: the academy's median age is 62, and only 14% of 5,765 voting members are younger than 50.

The haul was seized Tuesday from a cargo ship, the MSC Gayane, at the Port of Philadelphia, the Inquirer reported.  This amount of cocaine could kill millions—MILLIONS—of people,  US Attorney William McSwain tweeted. Two crew members were charged with breaking federal maritime drug trafficking laws. According to court filings, the men helped haul dozens of bales of cocaine aboard from at least 14 smaller boats that approached the Gayane while going back and forth to Peru. Shipping records showed the ship arrived in port early Monday morning. One of the crew members said he was paid $50,000 to participate in the scheme, court filings show, per NBC Philadelphia. The Gayane's recent stops included Panama, the Bahamas, and Colombia, according to shipping records. MSC, which owns 54 cargo ships, is headquartered in Europe, with operations in several US cities. In March, $77 million in cocaine was seized at the Port of New York and New Jersey, which officials at the time said was the largest drug bust this century at that port.","Ship's Cargo Was $1B in Cocaine, Feds Say","Ship's Cargo Was $____B in Cocaine, Feds Say",1,Copy( 1 ),0

On Friday, police officials shared what the New York Times describes as  part letter, part journal, in 13 pages with many cross-outs and messy scrawl.  It's variously emotive and mundane, including things like directions and details of the exercises he did, and he reportedly told the fisherman who brought him near North Sentinel Island to pass it to a friend should something happen to him. The Times has excerpts, and the writings tell more of what he brought to the tribe—scissors, safety pins, and fishing line—and how he attempted to communicate with them. Chau wrote that he sang worship songs and responded to the yells of one man, who was bedecked with a white, flower-like crown, by saying some words in Xhosa that he had picked up while in South Africa.  They would often fall silent after this,  he wrote. On other occasions, they laughed. At one point he questioned whether the island was  Satan’s last stronghold.  When the fisherman again brought him near the island on Nov. 16, he told them he planned to stay overnight, so they left him for the first time. On their pass by the island the next morning, they saw his body being dragged by a rope. The letter's last lines:  Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed. I love you all.

A huge number of Americans, according to the creator of a new app that lets people know if they have winning tickets. LottoLotto creator Brett Jacobson tells CNN that he filed public-records requests around the country and found that just over $2 billion in lottery winnings went uncollected last year—which works out to more than $38 million a week, or enough to create five new millionaires every day. The app records the numbers when a user takes a photo of a lottery ticket, lets them know which old ones are winners, and alerts them when a ticket wins. Some huge prizes go unclaimed—somebody missed out on a $16.6 million Powerball jackpot in Florida last year, according to the Tampa Tribune—but most of the unclaimed winnings are amounts as low as $2 or $4, says Jacobson. He says the app has had plenty of support from retailers, and with more lottery tickets sold every year, the amount of unclaimed cash is likely to keep growing.

"(Sep 5, 2020  6:30 AM CDT) He's had six murder trials, spent nearly two dozen years behind bars, and been sentenced to death four times. Now, Curtis Flowers is officially free. The Black man from Mississippi was released on bail in December—after the US Supreme Court overturned his most recent conviction involving a 1996 quadruple murder at a Winona furniture store—as it was decided to drop the charges against him or bring him to yet another trial. On Friday, it was announced the former had been chosen, with prosecutors noting a lack of witnesses, AFP and USA Today report.  It is in the interest of justice that the State will not seek an unprecedented seventh trial of Mr. Flowers,  prosecutors from the Mississippi attorney general's office said in a memo, per the New York Times. Until January, the same prosecutor, Doug Evans, had attended to Flowers' case through all six trials. Evans was accused of keeping Black jurors from serving—out of the 72 jurors in total who'd heard Flowers' case, 61 of them were white. In the US Supreme Court's decision last year, the justices found Evans had improperly kept Black jurors away. Flowers' first three convictions, which came with death sentences, were overturned by the state's Supreme Court, which cited misconduct on the part of the prosecution. The next two trials ended in hung juries, with the final conviction and death sentence handed down in 2010. Evans recused himself from the case earlier this year. Flowers, meanwhile, has always maintained his innocence.  I am finally free from the injustice that left me locked in a box for 23 years,  Flowers, 50, says in a statement on the charges finally being dropped.",He Was Tried 6 Times for Murder.

The boy's body can probably handle the altitude, doctors say, but psychologists and some members of the climbing community fear he may not be old enough to deal with the stress of having to make potentially life-or-death decisions.  My gut reaction was that 13 seems young to have the emotional maturity to decide to be there himself,  Erik Weihenmayer, the only blind person ever to reach Everest's summit, tells the New York Times. But  when I went up the mountain, I had people like one of my heroes, Ed Viesturs, saying I was going to slow my team down and kill them and myself, so I won’t be a dream crusher.  Romero—who is climbing with his father and three Sherpa guides—is currently at a base camp 6,000 feet short of the summit waiting out high winds, the AP reports.

My baby is gone,  Codrick's mother, Ashley Beal, lamented outside the house.

"(Jul 26, 2018  5:15 PM CDT) Always thought politicians were crooks? Now Amazon's facial recognition system agrees with you, but not in a good way. A test by the ACLU matching all 535 Congress members to 25,000 mugshots found 28 false positives—with a notably high number of people of color, the Verge reports.  An identification—whether accurate or not—could cost people their freedom or even their lives,  says the ACLU.  Congress must take these threats seriously, hit the brakes, and enact a moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition.  But Amazon defended its Rekognition API software, saying the ACLU used the default certainty threshold of 80%, while Amazon suggests cops crank it up to at least 95%. Yet there's nothing to make law enforcement use the higher setting. Rekognition drew attention in May when the ACLU revealed that several law enforcement agencies were using it. Privacy and civil rights groups cried foul, but police liked the price tag (around $12 a month), and at least one police force kept using it after a trial run, per USA Today. Some are concerned about racial bias: 39% of false positives in the ACLU test are people of color, including civil-rights leader John Lewis, while people of color comprise only 20% of Congress. Another test of facial-recognition software found higher false positives among blacks and women. Now three members of Congress have written Jeff Bezos expressing concerns about Rekognition.

But in spite of police questioning 12,000 men, only one suspect was ever arrested in the intervening five decades, and the case against him was ultimately thrown out for lack of evidence. Elsie's parents both died without learning who had killed their daughter, and her older sister and younger brother say that after all these years they want justice, and  didn’t want to die thinking we had not done anything.  Now, finally, police say there's been a break in the case. A year after Elsie's siblings asked police to reopen their investigation—which they did following a BBC Radio 4 series on the murder—authorities say they've arrested a 78-year-old man, reports the BBC. Peter Pickering, who was born in Manchester, apparently had links to Yorkshire, where Elsie was murdered, and would have been in his mid-20s in 1965. Though a murder weapon was never found, Elsie, who was said to have taken a different route home from school because she didn't want to get her new shoes muddy on her usual route, was found stabbed twice in the back (one pierced her heart), twice in the head, and once through the hand, reports the Guardian.

The boys could only talk in grunts; they weren't toilet-trained, and feces were strewn throughout their apartment home. The boys were saved from the apartment late last month, the AP notes, though child protection officials knew about the family for more than a year, the Denver Post reports. A family lawyer working near the home says he called child abuse services twice—once in 2012, and once this year—regarding his concerns, but the calls weren't investigated. Even before that, both parents had pleaded guilty to child abuse in both 2006 and 2009. Finally, doctors' suspicions were aroused on Sept. 29 when Bailey brought one child in to have a cut treated; the injury, as well as the child's condition, raised red flags, 7 News notes. Now, the state child protection ombudsman is investigating the delayed rescue, the Post reports.

For centuries, being able to afford the delicacy was a sign of prosperity—and with many Chinese coming into a time of just that, many are worried the booming country’s demand for shark’s fin will go too far. But along with slamming the distasteful process of ‘finning,’ critics are also beginning to notice how absolutely flavorless the fins themselves really are. After an arduous soaking and boiling process, Eilperin writes that the fins are  finally boiled for six to eight hours with chicken stock and Chinese ham to add flavor because there’s no taste otherwise.  In Hong Kong, demand is on the wane, but rural China is just getting started—shark’s fin soup has become a staple at middle-class weddings or business lunches.

The 59-year-old, charged Monday with issuing a bad check, allegedly failed to pay a $13,000 bill despite a police warning. He ordered 355 ceramic mugs, 288 T-shirts and 650 vinyl decals from Promotional Sales Limited in Stamford, Conn., receiving an invoice for $12,998.05 in September 2017, reports the Stamford Advocate.

A pair of US military jets intercepted six Russian aircraft near the coast of Alaska Wednesday evening, reports AP. The Russian pilots never entered US airspace, but instead remained in something called the Air Defense Identification Zone, which extends about 200 miles from the coast. Still, NORAD sent up two US jets  basically to let those aircraft know that we see them, and in case of a threat, to let them know we are there to protect our sovereign airspace,  says a spokesperson. The six Russian planes—two fighter jets, two long-range bombers, and two refueling tankers—eventually looped back toward Russia. Hours later, Canadian fighter jets intercepted two Russian long-range bombers over the Beaufort Sea, near the Canadian coast but again in the international zone.

But there will be a tournament, the NCAA said Monday. All 68 tournament games instead will be played in one place, CBS Sports reports, in recognition of the risk posed by the coronavirus pandemic. March Madness was canceled this year for the same reason.  It will be a very controlled environment,  an NCAA executive said, per the AP.  It'll be different, it’ll be historic, and it’ll be hopefully something we all treasure and experience just once, hopefully not ever again.  The tournament usually opens in Dayton, which counts on $4 million being generated. The regional sites were to be Minneapolis, New York, Denver, and Memphis. The NCAA made no announcement about the women's tournament, which runs at the same time. As of now, the women's Final Four is planned for San Antonio. The NCAA is negotiating to make the Indianapolis area the host, per ESPN. That surprised local health officials, though the NCAA had said it was  developing a solid plan to present a safe, responsible  event.  The Marion County Public Health Department has not received any details regarding this proposed initiative announced by the NCAA,  a statement said. The NCAA promises a  controlled environment  but not a  bubble  like the NBA formed. Anyone who enters that environment will not be able to leave and reenter, so the student-athletes who make the Final Four will have to stay in Indiana for a month.

And in 2018, two cops pleaded no contest to sexually assaulting several woman while on duty. The officers, Luis Valenzuela and James C. Nichols, said one worked as lookout while the other committed rape in an unmarked car. They're now serving 25 years each in state prison.

"(Apr 22, 2014  12:44 PM CDT) A few weeks after some newly-returned vets sang patriotic Toby Keith songs at a Colorado Springs bar's karaoke night in 2012, the bar owner found herself slapped with a $21,000 fine for not having permission to play the songs in her bar. LeShawn Carey registered the Carey-On Saloon with two of the three performing rights organizations that enforce copyright laws—ASCAP and SESAC—but not the third, BMI. She got in trouble for seven of the karaoke songs, five of them Keith's; the country star is repped by BMI. Carey says she's telling her story so other business owners know how important it is to register with, and pay fees to, all three organizations, the Gazette reports. The rule is: Any establishment that uses music to  enhance  a patron's experience needs to register—even if the music in question is coming from the radio or a TV—and it's safest to register with all three, so that you're covered no matter whose music ends up getting played. How much? For one business owner, fees for all three organizations add up to $4,500 per year. The companies have various methods of tracking down business owners not in compliance; in Carey's case, she was reported by an undercover BMI rep. BMI's PR director insists fines are a  last resort,  only after every effort has been made to bring a business into compliance. But Carey was already on BMI's radar after she previously closed the saloon in 2011. BMI told her she owed $1,200 at that point, but she didn't have the money, and when she re-opened, BMI wouldn't let her register unless she paid $8,693. It's not clear why the amount jumped so much.",Bar Owner Fined $21K— Over Karaoke,Bar Owner Fined $____K— Over Karaoke,21,"Paraphrase( 21,000 , K )",1

The new study isn't quite the same: It didn't measure what happens to happiness after the $50,000 mark, it just found that those making less than $50,000 weren't as satisfied with their lives. The new poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found that those making at least $50,000 per year were more satisfied in every area surveyed, including housing, relationships, neighborhood safety, health, employment, spirituality, community involvement, retirement prospects, finances, and general life direction.

"(May 23, 2015  2:45 PM CDT) Workers constructing a sewer line in East Jerusalem last month discovered a 2,000-year-old water-supply system that—think about this—worked fairly well until the last century, LiveScience reports. The 13-mile long Lower Aqueduct, which was fed by a spring south of Bethlehem and runs through four modern-day Jerusalem neighborhoods, was built by kings governing Judea and environs from roughly 140 BC to 37 BC. City rulers kept it up over the years, covering the open channel with terra cotta pipe about 500 years ago. It remained a major water-supply source until an electrical water distribution system replaced it roughly 100 years ago, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority. The IAA says it will cover part of the aqueduct  for the sake of future generations  and expose parts for access by the general public, Discovery reports. Meanwhile, archaeologists are marveling:  The aqueduct begins at the ‘En ‘Eitam spring, near Solomon’s Pools south of Bethlehem,  says IAA Director Ya'akov Billig.  Despite its length, it flows along a very gentle downward slope whereby the water level falls just one meter per kilometer of distance.  The original designers look pretty smart, too, having built the aqueduct in uninhabited areas where Jerusalem neighborhoods now exist, the Times of Israel notes. Other parts of the aqueduct system have been found before, including tunnels in the City of David and ones near the Sultan's Pool beside Mount Zion in Jerusalem.",Workers Stumble on 2K-Year-Old Marvel in Jerusalem,Workers Stumble on ____K-Year-Old Marvel in Jerusalem,2,"Paraphrase( 2,000 , K )",1

David Hemler says he walked off a base in Germany 28 years ago and hitchhiked to Sweden, where he only planned to stay a week but ended up building a new life under an alias, Reuters reports. Hemler, now 49, says he deserted at the age of 21 after getting involved with a pacifist church and becoming disillusioned with Ronald Reagan's policies. He is married to a Swedish citizen and has three children. His family in Pennsylvania had assumed he was dead until they heard from him a few weeks ago. Hemler says he decided to finally come forward after his youngest daughter turned two—old enough for his wife to put her in day care if he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations says Hemler contacted the agency about 10 days ago.  We really want to catch this guy,  she tells the New York Times.

"(Apr 25, 2016  8:03 AM CDT) It's long been speculated that Saudi Arabia played a major role in 9/11, and the so-called  28 pages  that have been locked up for years in the Capitol's basement may soon shed light on the matter if they are released by President Obama—a move that's now expected, the AP reports. The papers detail the findings of a congressional inquiry into what foreign entities provided support to the 9/11 hijackers while they planned the attacks. Former Sen. Bob Graham, who helped lead that inquiry, notes a White House official told him intel officers are reviewing the docs.  The most important unanswered question of 9/11 is: Did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?  he said on Sunday's Meet the Press, adding he finds it  implausible  they could have carried out such a plan without outside aid, per the Hill.  All the evidence points to Saudi Arabia,  he said. Graham isn't alone: The 28pages.org website has been lobbying for the pages to be brought  out of the shadows,  while other lawmakers and some 9/11 victims' families are similarly quizzical regarding Saudi involvement. Then-President George W. Bush had ordered those pages stripped from the original 838-page report, warning that US intelligence secrets could be at risk. When asked how declassifying these pages would impact the strained relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, Graham said  7.838  on a scale of 1 to 10, per the New York Daily News—i.e., a  high-level negative impact,  as Chuck Todd put it. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, says it's been  wrongfully and morbidly accused of complicity  and that it wants those 28 pages publicized so it could  respond to any allegations in a clear and credible manner.

"(Sep 23, 2017  5:04 PM CDT) A humanitarian crisis grew Saturday in Puerto Rico as towns were left without fresh water, fuel, power, or phone service following Hurricane Maria's devastating passage across the island, the AP reports. A group of anxious mayors arrived in the capital to meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossello to present a long list of items they urgently need. The north coastal town of Manati had run out of fuel and fresh water, Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez said.  Hysteria is starting to spread. The hospital is about to collapse. It's at capacity,  he said, crying.  We need someone to help us immediately.  The death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico was at least 10, including two police officers who drowned in floodwaters in the western town of Aguada. That number was expected to climb as officials from remote towns continued to check in with officials in San Juan. Authorities in the town of Vega Alta on the north coast said they had been unable to reach an entire neighborhood and were particularly worried about residents of a nursing home.  I need to get there today,  Mayor Oscar Santiago said.  Not tomorrow, today.  Rossello said Maria would clearly cost more than the last major storm to wallop the island, Hurricane Georges in September 1998.  This is without a doubt the biggest catastrophe in modern history for Puerto Rico,  he said. Officials said 1,360 of the island's 1,600 cellphone towers were downed, and 85% of above-ground and underground phone and internet cables were knocked out. With roads blocked and phones dead, officials said, the situation may worsen.

Now Adam is suing the Washington DC university, where he just finished his junior year, USA Today reports. Adam Semprevivo's lawyer tells the Daily Beast Georgetown notified the rising senior on Wednesday that he would be expelled. Per the lawsuit, the university is also considering nullifying his earned academic credits. The suit says doing so would deprive Semprevivo of due process and violate 10 of the procedures outlined in Georgetown's honor system, including appointing an investigations officer, making a written report on the alleged violation, organizing a hearing board, and allowing the student the right to appeal evidence. Semprevivo says he had no knowledge of his father's payment, a portion of which allegedly went to then-tennis coach Gordon Ernst, who allegedly fraudulently designated the younger Semprevivo as a Georgetown tennis recruit. Per the lawsuit, Georgetown started investigating Ernst as early as 2017, yet despite knowing about the alleged bribes as well as his connection to Semprevivo's admission, it continued allowing Semprevivo to pay tuition and take classes. Semprevivo's lawyer says Adam offered last month to withdraw from Georgetown as long as the university agreed not to expel him or nullify his credits; on Tuesday, the university's legal counsel said it would not agree to that, per the lawsuit.

"(Sep 10, 2020  4:37 PM CDT) An economist is backing a provocative idea on a COVID vaccine: Anyone who gets a shot should receive $1,000 from the government. So argues Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw in a New York Times op-ed. Mankiw is actually writing in support of a proposal first floated by fellow economist Robert Litan at the Brookings Institution. The thinking goes like this: When a vaccine finally arrives, it won't have maximum effect until enough people get a shot to achieve herd immunity. But that means 70% to 90% will need to be vaccinated, and current polls in the US suggest we won't reach that threshold. Solution: Give people a financial incentive to roll up their sleeves for a shot.  Immunology, meet economics,  writes Mankiw.  One of the first principles of economics—perhaps the most important—is that people respond to incentives.  This proposal is  textbook economics,  he writes, delving into the particulars of  positive externalities  and such. It would be a huge expense, somewhere around $300 billion, but that is actually a  bargain  when compared to previous and proposed relief packages, Litan asserts. Mankiw adds that Congress can worry about lowering the government debt once the pandemic subsides. He ends with a suggestion to apply the principle elsewhere:  Perhaps after seeing how a vaccine subsidy can end one crisis, Congress will pay for it by adopting a carbon tax to avert another.

And as the New York Times reports, top US officials are keeping Kosovo very much in mind as they weigh their options. President Obama would likely never get the approval of the UN Security Council for a military response because of Russia's veto power. When Bill Clinton was in the same boat in 1999, he turned to NATO and got its blessing for 78 days of airstrikes.  It’s a step too far to say we’re drawing up legal justifications for an action, given that the president hasn’t made a decision,  a government official tells the Times.  But Kosovo, of course, is a precedent of something that is perhaps similar.  Obama was meeting today with national security aides to determine next steps if the US concludes that Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons.

But after pulling 16 of the 18 teeth, the dentist stopped and told Walters to get her heart checked. As Waddell and Walters' sister struggled to get her and the oxygen tank to the car, Walters said she couldn't breathe, and though staff came out with more oxygen, nobody performed CPR until an ambulance arrived, at which point it was too late. The family has passed its $2,000 GoFundMe goal to cover funeral costs. Meanwhile, an investigation is underway.

"(Nov 28, 2016  5:36 PM) For more than two years, Leroy Bailey has been hoofing it around the US to raise money for hope—and on Saturday, he finally made it home. The 54-year-old contractor has been on the road for the past 29 months—he took leave of his Virginia Beach home in June 2014—and he's covered more than 11,500 miles, all in the name of attracting funds for his plan to erect  hope centers  (i.e., homeless shelters) across the country, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Bailey, who says he'd been homeless himself while in his 20s in Buffalo, NY, per the Servants of God Ministries website, relived that experience during his trek, on which he was constantly stopped by cops apparently suspicious of his backpack and even turned away by churches.  If you look homeless, they don't want you there,  he says. And so he often resorted to napping under bridges or sprawled on picnic tables, jars of peanut butter his only reliable food source (his church contributed money toward other meals). He also had to deal with illness—he was hospitalized in Maine for pneumonia—walking-induced injuries like blisters and shin splints, and missing and stolen belongings. His long haul stretched way past the original 18 months Bailey had allotted for his journey (he ended up plowing through 10 pairs of shoes), and he only raised about $10,000 out of his $400,000 goal, per his GoFundMe page. But he says that's enough to at least start a shelter in Virginia Beach, and he also reaped another unexpected benefit: contact with his son, whom he'd been searching for for years (the son now lives in New York) and whose wife saw Bailey's story circulating on social media.  It's amazing after all these years he was just a hop, skip, and a jump away,  Bailey's wife, Luci, tells the Pilot.

Interior Minister Matteo Salvini—an anti-immigrant politician who has refused to let the asylum seekers set foot on Italian soil—has threatened to send those aboard the vessel, which is named the Diciotti, back to Libya. Critics say Salvini is breaking both Italian and international law. And Italian media has reported that a public prosecutor was investigating an  unknown person  for illegal imprisonment, according to DW.com. In reply to potential legal jeopardy, though, Salvini said,  I'm not afraid of anything. I have a clean conscience,  per Courthouse News. On Thursday, 27 children between 14 and 16 years of age were allowed to leave the boat, per DW.com. As for the rest of the migrants, Salvini, who has pledged to deport some 500,000 immigrants from Italy, is asking other European Union countries to accept them, even threatening to withhold payments to the EU. As of Friday, Belgian and Hungary had refused, according to reports, and Germany has not made a decision. While Salvini's hardline stance on immigration reportedly has popular support, not all Italians agree with him. Earlier this week, some 300 people brought arancini (fried rice balls) to the Sicilian port where the Diciotti is docked as, organizers said,  a symbol of welcome and assistance, The Local reports.

The jury's verdict orders the religious group to pay a record $21 million in punitive damages to the victim, now 26, reports MSNBC. It also has to pay a portion of the $7 million in compensatory damages awarded earlier.  This is the first case I know of where a church has been hit with liability involving a rank-and-file member,  says an attorney for the congregation. He plans to appeal. The jury found that senior members of a Jehovah's Witnesses congregation in Fremont were aware that one member was convicted of the sexual abuse of a child but, following national church policy, kept the information secret. The member then allegedly molested the plaintiff over a two-year period beginning when she was 9. The accused member was never criminally charged with molesting the plaintiff, but police are now investigating.

"(Apr 2, 2012  6:16 PM CDT) Federal officers rounded up more than 3,100 immigrants today in what the Obama administration called the biggest-ever sweep of illegals across the US, the AP reports. The six-day operation, involving more than 1,900 officers and agents, focused on apprehending immigrants who were fugitives or had serious rap sheets. Others had ignored previous orders to leave the country.  There are 3,168 fewer criminal aliens and egregious immigration law violators in our neighborhoods,  said top immigration officer John Morton. The round-up exemplifies President Obama's decision to pursue allegedly dangerous immigrants—a policy that tries to thread the needle between so-called  amnesty  and the deportation of illegals without a criminal record, the Huffington Post reports. Two previous round-ups, last September and last May, together netted more than 5,300 immigrants.

Agents served search and arrest warrants on homes, warehouses, and smoke shops in at least 25 states this morning, a DEA spokesman said. The largest single operation is a state-wide effort in Alabama. Agents also are serving warrants in Florida and New Mexico, among other states. The crackdown involves 33 DEA cases, and seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations.

Heather Mosher married David Mosher on Dec. 22 during a small ceremony at St. Francis Hospital, where Heather was being treated for triple-negative breast cancer, an often more aggressive and difficult to treat form, WFSB reports. The ceremony was held in the hospital chapel, with the couple surrounded by family and friends. The bride, who was on life support, said her vows from her hospital bed, wearing a wedding dress, jewelry, and a wig, ABC News reports. Eighteen hours later, she passed away. The couple, who met as part of a swing dance group, got engaged Dec. 23, 2016, exactly one year prior to the day Heather died; their engagement came on the same day Heather was diagnosed with breast cancer.  A pair of draft horses, a carriage, and I arranged it all for that night. We went out on the carriage ride and I proposed to her under a street light,  David said. The cancer began spreading in September, and doctors in December told David that Heather likely wouldn't make it to the couple's scheduled wedding date, so they pushed the ceremony forward about a week. On Dec. 30, David Mosher attended his new wife's funeral on what was originally to be their wedding day.

Keith Jean fled into the sewer system in Newark, NJ, two weeks ago after swimming across the Passaic River to get away from police, and there's been no sign of him since either inside or outside the sewer system, NJ Advance Media reports. The chances of the 31-year-old having created a Penguin-style crime lair down there are slim: Officials say the outflow pipe he entered leads to a network of cramped chambers where he would find potentially deadly gases, and to a main tunnel where there's a constant flow of human waste from Newark and 47 other northern New Jersey communities. Robots have searched the tunnels, and cadaver dogs have sniffed sewer grates, but they haven't found traces of Jean, alive or dead. Cops say he was a passenger in a car stopped for suspicious activity near a parking lot where there had been reports of car break-ins, the Jersey Journal reports. After he fled, they discovered there were warrants out for his arrest in two New Jersey counties. Manholes were staked out after he fled into the sewer, but police believe he may still have been able to slip away.

Widely considered the most popular Spanish-language writer since Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century, the Colombia native achieved literary celebrity that spawned comparisons to Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. His flamboyant and melancholy fictional works—among them Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Love in the Time of Cholera, and Autumn of the Patriarch—outsold everything published in Spanish except the Bible. The epic 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude sold more than 50 million copies in more than 25 languages. His stories made him literature's best-known practitioner of magical realism, the fictional blending of the everyday with fantastical elements such as a boy born with a pig's tail and a man trailed by a swarm of yellow butterflies.

A former neighbor, 30-year-old Jason Kozan, has been charged with feloniously vandalizing the home starting in May 2014 and ending in June 2015, according to court records. Albert Clemens Sr. has said the attacks damaged his home and kept his family on edge.

Clemens said he used to clean up each time but stopped because it was happening so often—the house would be egged several times a week. He said his insurer wouldn't settle a claim until police caught the vandal, so Clemens said he would wait until then to make repairs. Detectives haven't identified a motive for the eggings, but they largely stopped once Kozan moved away.  Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,  Lt.

The move ends a 140-year effort (called the longest-running litigation in Kiwi history) on the part of a Maori tribe who claim the Whanganui River as an ancestor. The settlement, passed into law by Parliament on Wednesday, means that harming the river on the North Island is equivalent to harming a person.  We consider the river an ancestor and always have,  Whanganui tribal negotiator Gerrard Albert tells the Guardian. He says the fight was over finding a legal means of treating the river, the country's third-longest,  as a living entity  instead  treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.  The  Whanganui Treaty settlement  includes $80 million in redress and another $30 million to ensure the river's health, per the BBC. Two guardians will be named, one from the tribe and another from the crown, who would represent the waterway in court proceedings. Legislator Adrian Rurawhe explains the concept is normal to the Maori and best captured in the tribal saying,  I am the river and the river is me.  He tells the New Zealand Herald that maybe the rest of the world is finally catching up with the Maori and  seeing things the way that we see them.  Still think it's, well, bizarre?

Thirteen years after playing the same set of numbers every month in the Idaho lottery, the group of 33 workers who work on heating and cooling university buildings hit pay dirt when Steve Hughes left his truck running to keep his dog Stella warm while he went inside to a gas station near Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, on Jan. 6. Utah has no lottery. When he returned to his truck, his miniature pinscher had locked him out by putting her paw on the manual lock. Hughes, 29, planned to buy the ticket elsewhere, but instead he had his girlfriend buy it there while he tried to open the door with a slim jim. He eventually coached Stella to put her paws on the electronic window button in the back seat, allowing Hughes to get in the car. What seemed like an annoying delay that day turned out to be serendipitous when the group discovered Wednesday night that they had won second prize in the Idaho Powerball.

Here's a little song / About a man gone wrong  begins Baez's  Nasty Man,  the first song she's written in 25 years, and it's a protest anthem apparently inspired by Trump himself. Among other topics, the song, which Baez posted to her Facebook page Tuesday, alludes to the president  stomping  through the White House Rose Garden, the  big-liest wall  he wants to build, and Melania Trump holing up in New York with her jewels. Baez even throws a bit of prognostication into the final lyrics:  When the dirt on this man finally hits the fan / And no one gives a damn about his tweets / He'll be finally and forever obsolete.  Baez, 76, who's set to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Friday, tells Rolling Stone she's not sure if she'll actually release the ballad— It's not a good song,  she says, adding she mainly did it to make people laugh—but she says it did lift her out of a 10-year funk of sorts.

"(Feb 9, 2018  12:13 PM) In Arizona lurks Necessary Evil, an imposing rock face that has presented a  heinous  climb for the only dozen or so male athletes who have ascended it. One climber who attempted it says it's an incredibly challenging task for anyone under 5 foot 10, but this week, two female rock climbers, Michaela Kiersch and Paige Claassen, became the first women to  send  (successfully finish a route without falling or leaning on gear) the behemoth 90-foot climb—one charting in with a height of just 5 foot 6, the other at 5 foot 1, per Outside. The tinier of the two women, 23-year-old Kiersch, was the first one to earn Necessary Evil honors on Tuesday, while 27-year-old Claassen sent the route the very next day. Outside describes in detail the arduous challenges of conquering Necessary Evil, including extra-long reaches between extremely small holds, a rough rock surface that scrapes one's skin, an ear-piercing din from the trucks on the highway below, and the need for perfect weather.  It's finicky—it can't be too hot or too cold or too humid, because it will feel impossible,  says climber Alex Honnold, who has tried and failed to conquer the rock.  Unless it's too dry, then it will feel slippery.  Still, both women persevered and got their payoff.  [Michaela and I] are very different climbers in terms of strength and size, but it was cool to cheer each other on, and we had a solid group of ladies up at the crag,  Claassen says.

"(May 15, 2019  12:34 PM CDT) North Korea said Wednesday it is suffering its worst drought since 1982, with an average of just 2.1 inches of rain having fallen in the country during the first five months of the year. In 1982, the level was 2 inches during that same period. The drought is expected to continue until the end of this month; a North Korean newspaper says officials and workers are trying to find new water sources as well as minimize the damage to agriculture. Earlier this month, UN food agencies reported a joint assessment showing that after one of the worst harvests in the country in a decade, about 10 million people there are facing  severe food shortages.  And in February, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations issued what the AP calls  an unusual appeal for urgent food assistance.  The Guardian reports that last year, food production in North Korea hit its lowest level in a decade.  We are particularly concerned about the impact that this early drought will have on children and adults who are already struggling to survive,  says a Red Cross rep.  Even before this drought, one in five children under five years old was stunted because of poor nutrition. We are concerned that these children will not be able to cope with further stress on their bodies.  North Korea has blamed bad weather and international economic sanctions for the food shortage, and experts say climate change is playing a role. South Korea is considering providing food aid, but Japan's foreign minister said last week food aid should not be sent as long as the country's leaders prioritize nuclear weapons development over citizens' welfare.",North Korea Suffering Worst Drought Since 1982,North Korea Suffering Worst Drought Since ____,1982,Copy( 1982 ),0

"(Mar 23, 2016  4:44 PM CDT) A 12-year-old boy who was shaken as a baby and remained in a vegetative state for the rest of his life has died, authorities said Wednesday. Aiden Stein died Sunday at a Columbus hospital. The case drew national attention when his parents waged a successful legal fight to prevent a court-appointed guardian from having him removed from life support. Three doctors had testified that Aiden would never recover. The Ohio Supreme Court eventually ruled that a probate court lacked the authority to allow a guardian to stop the care keeping Aiden alive when his parents hadn't permanently lost their parenting rights. Four-month-old Aiden was rushed to a Mansfield hospital in March 2004 after his father, 21-year-old Matthew Stein, reported the baby had lost consciousness. Stein was later convicted of felonious assault and child endangerment and spent eight years in prison despite his assertions that he never injured his son. Richland County Prosecutor Bambi Couch Page told the AP on Wednesday that it was  unlikely  she'd pursue further charges against Stein.  I would have to look at the reason (Aiden) died,  Couch Page said.  But there would probably be a stretch in jurors' minds that he died as the result of what the dad did.

Illma Gore's piece,  Making America Great Again,  is hanging at the Maddox Gallery in London after US galleries refused to show it over security concerns, the Guardian reports. Why the big stir? In part because the Republican presidential candidate's penis appears a little small—especially when compared to the painting's $1.4 million price tag.  Who knew it would be such a big deal?  says Gore.  I think an artist’s job is to take the times we’re living in and then set the scene. It is a representation of where we are.  She says she went to Britain after receiving the anonymous death threats. The painting first went viral on Gore's Facebook page in February, and she has since been tangled up in a confusing back-and-forth with the site over the image, Motherboard reports. First it was banned, but it's now back. It also was delisted from eBay after an anonymous third party filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice threatening to sue Gore if she sells the work, reports CBS News. Amid all this, Gore is offering free downloads on her website. Cordelia de Freitas, director of the Maddox gallery, says interest rose in the 11 -by-14  painting after Trump referenced the size of his genitals in a debate.

Liliya Shobukhova, winner of the Chicago Marathon from 2009 to 2011, is said to have paid Russia's athletics federation some $550,000 to cover up a positive drug test.

Judge John Cleland revoked his bail and ordered him taken to the county jail to await sentencing in about three months. Many of the charges carry mandatory minimum sentences. Sandusky half-waved toward his family in the courtroom as the sheriff led him away. Outside, he calmly walked to a sheriff's car with his hands cuffed in front of him. Almost immediately after the judge adjourned the case, loud cheers could be heard from a couple of hundred people gathered outside the courthouse as word quickly spread that Sandusky had been convicted. Yesterday, Sandusky's adopted son, Matt, told prosecutors for the first time that he had been molested, too.",Jerry Sandusky Guilty on 45 Counts,Jerry Sandusky Guilty on ____ Counts,45,Copy( 45 ),0
"(Apr 5, 2019  11:03 AM CDT) If you or any family members stayed at a Motel 6 in the state of Washington between Feb. 1, 2015, and Sept. 17, 2017, you may want to check out the latest statement from the attorney general there. Per NPR, Bob Ferguson announced that Motel 6 will pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit filed by his state after the hotel chain infringed on the privacy of tens of thousands of guests by sharing information on those guests with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The attorney general's statement notes that over that two-year-plus time period, workers at seven Motel 6 locations gave up to ICE personal details on about 80,000 guests, without those visitors' consent. In addition to guest names, info offered to the agency included everything from driver's license and passport numbers to DOBs, license plate numbers, and what rooms guests were staying in. That release of info spurred ICE to investigate guests with Latino-sounding names, which led, in some cases, to loss of jobs and homes, and even to deportations, per the AG statement. One anecdote mentioned a Seattle dad who holed up in a Motel 6 room near SeaTac to wrap Christmas gifts for his kids. ICE agents detained him, then deported him; his wife had to go to the hotel room to pick up the Christmas gifts.  Motel 6's actions tore families apart and violated the privacy rights of tens of thousands of Washingtonians,  Ferguson says. In addition to the $12 million payout—more than $10 million of which will go toward restitution for affected Motel 6 guests—Motel 6 also has signed a contract that assures no more guest info will be handed over without a warrant or via other lawful means, and the chain will train workers on what to do if they're asked to give up such information.",He Went to Motel 6 to Wrap His Kids' Gifts.

"(Oct 1, 2019  2:28 AM CDT) A disbarred attorney from Georgia who allegedly killed his mother and went on the run instead of surrendering to serve a prison sentence has been recaptured after eight months as a fugitive. Authorities say Richard Merritt was arrested by the US Marshals Service in a thrift store in Nashville on Monday, CNN reports. Merritt pleaded guilty in January to theft, forgery, and elder-exploitation charges involving 17 of his clients, 11 Alive reports. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to report to the Cobb County Jail on Feb. 1. Instead, authorities say, he cut off his ankle monitor. The body of Merritt's mother, Shirley Merritt, was found in her home on Feb. 2. Merritt had been living with her while out on bond. Police believe Merritt stabbed his mother to death and stole her vehicle. Before he was sentenced, investigators said Merritt, who surrendered his license to practice law in early 2018, settled lawsuits without his clients' knowledge and spent the money to go on vacations and buy a Porsche. In addition to the 15 years in prison, he was sentenced to 15 years of probation and ordered to pay $454,706 in restitution, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. His brother, Robert, says their mother was close to Richard and was always very supportive. He says it was a mistake for the judge to give his brother time to get his affairs in order before going to prison.  I think there was always a concern that he might flee given the nature of the crimes he had committed, but no one ever saw this coming,  he says.",Fugitive Disbarred Attorney Captured After 8 Months,Fugitive Disbarred Attorney Captured After ____ Months,8,Trans( eight ),1

"(Sep 9, 2016  10:14 AM CDT) The five-second rule is off by about five seconds in many cases, and not in the direction you hoped. That's what Rutgers researchers say in a new study debunking the classic kitchen rule, which declares it safe to eat food off the floor if scooped up in a flash.  We decided to look into this because the practice is so widespread,  despite little research to back it up, Donald Schaffner tells Rutgers Today. After dropping watermelon, bread, bread with butter, and gummy candy on stainless steel, tile, wood, and carpeted surfaces crawling with salmonella-like bacteria about 2,500 times—and leaving the food untouched for one, five, 30, or 300 seconds—Schaffner and his team found that food could become contaminated  instantaneously,  they report in Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The longer food sat on the surface, the more bacteria was usually transferred. But in certain cases, contamination occurred immediately, Schaffner says. That's because bacteria  move with the moisture, and the wetter the food, the higher the risk of transfer.  Watermelon, for example, was contaminated most often, and gummy candy least often. To sum up,  the five-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food,  Schaffner says. If you are going to eat food off the floor, carpet is your best bet, since it was least likely to transfer bacteria, say researchers—who point out a 2005 Mythbusters episode found no differences between food left on the floor for two or six seconds, per CTV News.

In a Narratively piece titled  What it Feels Like To Be Adopted at 17,  Lyric, now a college grad who lives in Seattle, recounts her experiences of transitioning from a dysfunctional environment into a loving, supportive one. Lyric recalls an episode from when she was 7 years old in which a trip to Chuck E. Cheese gets sidetracked. Instead of games and prizes, the day ends with both of her parents being hauled away by the police.  I chased the cop car carrying my mom,  she writes.  The car was too fast to keep up with.  Some 10 years later, a high school counselor tasked Lyric with examining her life and family.  So I did,  she writes. She began to see how dysfunctional her home life was. Why hadn't her parents intervened when she was molested? Why did they buy new TVs when food and clothes were lacking? She also began spending more time with the Esparzas.

The spot near St. Mark's Square reportedly charged them $1,350 for the meal; they paid the tab then filed a complaint Monday.

One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States, maybe it's true here as well,  he said, per the Guardian,  is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be' and then we start sometimes creating what’s called a 'circular firing squad,' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.

George Thomas Thornton gained national attention over the exploding whale, and the act endured for decades thanks to a video that shows giant pieces of whale carcass splattering across the beach and spectators. Thornton got the call Nov. 12, 1970, to remove a 45-foot-long sperm whale estimated to weigh 8 tons that had washed up near Florence and had started to stink; at the time, the state Highway Division had jurisdiction over beaches. Thornton felt they couldn't haul the whale out to sea because it would wash back up. They couldn't bury it on the beach, because the waves would uncover it. And they couldn't burn it. So Thornton consulted the Navy and other munitions experts, and was advised to blow it up. His crew set the dynamite on the landward side of the whale, hoping to blow it into the water and into little pieces that could be consumed by gulls and crabs. About 75 spectators and news reporters drew back to a sand dune a quarter mile away. When the blast erupted, it was greeted with cries of wonder that were soon replaced by sounds of revulsion as bits of whale covered people in goo; one big chunk even flattened the roof of a car. Thornton had refused to talk about the exploding whale for many years, once remarking that every time he did,  it blew up in my face.",Man Who Famously Blew Up Whale Dead at 84,Man Who Famously Blew Up Whale Dead at ____,84,Copy( 84 ),0
"(May 15, 2018  12:15 PM CDT) Pattie Bastian waited more than 30 years for some kind of closure on her young daughter's death—and now, finally,  justice is Jenni's.  In what the News Tribune calls  one of the most heartbreaking  cases in the history of Tacoma, Wash., 60-year-old Robert D. Washburn was arrested Thursday and charged with the murder of 13-year-old Jennifer Bastian, who disappeared during a bike ride in a local park on Aug. 4, 1986. Jennifer's body was found more than three weeks later in what KOMO describes as a  remote area  of Point Defiance Park, and evidence showed she'd been sexually assaulted and strangled. The case soon went cold—until DNA evidence that emerged in 2013 took investigators in a new direction. Even though DNA retrieved from Jennifer's bathing suit didn't initially find a match in national and state registries, there were 2,300 names listed in Jennifer's case paperwork—and investigators decided to ask those who didn't have DNA on file to voluntarily submit to testing. Washburn—who'd once called in a tip on Welch's case and had since moved to Illinois—was one of those names, and in March 2017 he submitted a sample; a match was made and he was arrested in Eureka.  This is the best feeling yet,  one of the original detectives who worked on the case tells KOMO. Jennifer's mother told reporters Monday:  We never gave up on wanting justice for Jenni. Tacoma never gave up wanting justice for Jenni. And now, after all this time, justice is Jenni's.

"(Sep 20, 2012  6:54 AM CDT) The latest iPhone operating system is missing a key feature: Embedded Google maps. Instead, phones using iOS 6 will be treated to Apple's own mapping system, and that's a very mixed bag, analysts tell the New York Times of the software update released yesterday. Sure, it looks nice; it zooms and pans faster and offers 3D overhead views of major cities. Plus, users can ask Siri for directions and get detailed, spoken guidance. But Apple's brand new system needs some serious tweaking. Notes an entrepreneur blogger: Apple has  used their platform dominance to privilege their own app over a competitor’s offering, even though it’s a worse experience for users.  For example, the app couldn't find  Heine Brothers  coffee shop when a user searched for  Heine Bros.  Nor was it able to identify Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. There's no public transportation information, and sometimes the app comes up with the wrong city in searches.  It takes a long time and effort to figure out how to do this right,  says a Google rep. But with millions of potential users, Apple is likely to give the app a serious upgrade within a year or two, an expert notes.","iOS 6: Goodbye, Google Maps","iOS ____: Goodbye, Google Maps",6,Copy( 6 ),0

But Chicagoans should hope the honor goes elsewhere, writes Steve Chapman for Reason. The Olympics tend to be a huge cost and hassle with little benefit. Does Chicago, home state of the most powerful man in the world, need any more exposure? Studies have found that the massive publicity hosting the Olympics gives a city doesn’t really confer any measurable reward. Then there’s cost: London’s budget for the 2012 Games has tripled since it won the bid.

Colombian officials have nabbed Mark Grenon and his son Joseph Grenon and accused them of selling a  miracle  drink that has already killed seven Americans, CBS News reports. The nation's top prosecutor said the Grenons were arrested in the town of Santa Marta for sending their  Miracle Mineral Solution —really chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleach—to the US, Africa, and other parts of Colombia. Mark Grenon is the leader of a purported Florida church called Genesis II, which peddles the substance and claims it can cure nearly any illness, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, and, of course, COVID-19. Back in July, federal authorities charged Mark and his three sons with dealing an unregulated, possibly dangerous substance. Hazmat teams searched the church grounds in Bradenton under federal order and uncovered 50 gallons of muriatic acid—which health officials warn can cause  severe corrosive injury —along with 8,300 pounds of sodium chlorite, which can be unhealthy in large amounts. The US Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of MMS and told consumers of the product to  stop now.  When the Guardian prompted Mark for a response, he said in part:  May God open your eyes Picklehead Ed that doesn't research the Truth or YOU ARE A PAID LIAR!

The hack, initially reported last year, was far larger than was clear at the time, the Journal notes.  It was a real big deal,  the official says.  The thing got into the bloodstream, and it wasn't just in the main arteries, it was in all the little capillaries.  But the response, he notes, was ultimately a  success.  That response was led by Adm. Michael Rogers, President Obama's nominee to be the next head of the embattled NSA, and he'll likely face questions over the attack as he seeks confirmation. Rogers has his defenders, though:  It was a big problem, but it was a success,  says a senior Pentagon official.  Mike Rogers did a very, very good job handling this.  The attack, which lasted until November, hit the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, which handles nonsensitive information; classified networks don't appear to have been hacked, officials say. Immediate repairs cost some $10 million, and that figure is poised to increase as authorities look to patch holes revealed by the attack.

An indictment issued last month said seven Vineland Developmental Center nurses failed to aid the  physical or mental health  of resident Wendy Hart, whom officials described as physically and mentally disabled. Prosecutors alleged the nurses wrapped a bandage around Hart's hand so tightly that it developed gangrene and had to be amputated in April 2012, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services report.

Officials said two of the defendants were registered nurses and the others are licensed practical nurses. They are charged with endangering the welfare of a disabled person. Four of the nurses are also charged with official misconduct and falsifying or tampering with records.

A jury this week awarded 53-year-old Marion Hedges the money seven years after the incident at the East River Plaza Mall left her with severe brain injuries, reports the New York Times. She has partially recovered, though she continues to suffer the effects today, as evidenced by this line in the New York Post: Hedges  shook with emotion when the verdict was announced—but she didn’t shed a tear because a side effect of her brain damage is the inability to cry.  Hedges had been returning to her car in a parking kiosk after shopping for Halloween candy when two boys, ages 12 and 13, dumped a shopping cart from a walkway more than 70 feet above her. The cart struck her in the head. The boys were caught and served time in a juvenile detention facility, but the jury found them only 10% responsible. Jurors deemed the mall 65% responsible and a security company the remaining 25%. Hedges is a philanthropist, and she promises to use part of the money to help kids in the neighborhood.

Backers say the tide of public opinion has turned strongly in favor of legalizing and taxing pot for personal use, especially in light of its potential to help alleviate the state's catastrophic budget woes. In Oakland alone, legalization could mean $400,000 a year in extra municipal revenue, advocates contend.  It's not the complete answer to the state budget crisis, but it's a piece of the puzzle that could be put into place relatively easily,  said one proponent.

Anthony Sanborn, 44, had been convicted of killing 16-year-old Jessica Briggs and sentenced to 70 years in prison. At a hearing earlier Thursday, Hope Cady testified that as a troubled 13-year-old she was pressured by police and prosecutors into identifying Sanborn, who was 16 at the time, as the killer. She said she was facing juvenile charges, and authorities threatened to send her away for years. She said she was legally blind when the murder occurred, meaning her vision wasn't good enough to have been able to see what happened, the AP reports. Officials say Briggs' throat was slit and she was stabbed repeatedly before being thrown in Portland Harbor. Cady testified that police and prosecutors told her what to say at trial and she had no knowledge of the killing. She said two detectives  stalked  her and shouted at her during an hours-long interview. Justice Joyce Wheeler appeared alarmed by how heavily the state had relied on Cady's testimony, reports the Bangor Daily News.

Police arrested a 13-year-old boy the day after the Dec. 11 attack in New York City's Morningside Park, and on Friday arrested the 14-year-old boy they say actually wielded the knife; that teen had been arrested Dec. 26 but was initially released. The third and final suspect is another 14-year-old boy whom police had previously questioned but let go, the New York Post reports. Both 14-year-olds, who are being tried as adults, pleaded not guilty in a court appearance Wednesday to charges including second-degree murder, first-degree robbery, and second-degree robbery. Prosecutors say one of the 14-year-olds put Majors, 18, in a  bear hug or headlock  while the other stabbed her to death during what authorities say was a botched robbery. They say all three boys considered two other victims before settling on Majors as she walked in the park.  The defendant stated ... that he was in the park and tried to take the girl’s phone and ‘she was hanging onto her phone’ and that he hit her with a knife,  according to a criminal complaint. Per NBC New York, a witness told police he  heard a male voice [say] 'run your s---. Gimme your phone. You got some weed, gimme that too.'

It’s just one of several Paris Air Show embarrassments for the Boeing rival, the AP reports: Airbus also canceled the demo of its A400M military transport plane due to a gearbox issue, and the company on Saturday announced that two versions of its A350 jet would be delayed two years.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls the DOJ warrant unconstitutional and a  fishing expedition.  The digital rights organization, which is advising DreamHost, says  no plausible explanation exists for a search warrant of this breadth, other than to cast a digital dragnet as broadly as possible.  Similar warrants have been used to go after websites disseminating illegal content, such as child pornography, but DreamHost says DisruptJ20.org was only used to facilitate legal political speech.

That's what archivists at the National Library of Norway in Mo i Rana recently discovered during a digitization project, stumbling across two reels of a long-lost 1927 Walt Disney movie that was the company's first Christmas film, the Huffington Post reports. Empty Socks stars Oswald, a precursor to Mickey whose relation is obvious once you see the character is basically Mickey with rabbit ears. The only other footage that's known to exist of this film is a 25-second scrap of footage housed at NYC's Museum of Modern Art. The newly discovered reels had been kept all this time in a special room with controlled temps and humidity, AFP reports.  At the beginning, we didn't know it was a lost cinematographic treasure,  an archivist says in a statement. In fact, library staff thought the five-minute, 30-second flick (with one minute missing in the middle) was a Felix the Cat oldie. But after weighing in with an animation historian, they realized they had one of the earliest movies with Oswald, created by Disney himself and partner Ub Iwerks. The library has the original—which was provided by the Norwegian Film Institute and probably originated with a private collector—and sent a copy to the Walt Disney Company. But why did Oswald fall out of favor with Disney? Universal wrested rights to the character away during a contract dispute, forcing Walt and Ub to come up with someone else who stuck around a little longer: the most famous mouse in the world.

Instead, the staffer ensured an unwitting couple were significantly richer in time for Christmas. The New York Times has the story from Midsomer Norton, England, where a couple had dropped off boxes at a dump after cleaning out the home of a deceased relative, who had a habit of hiding cash. Upon discovering that one box containing a household item also contained a separate box with stacks of bills, a staffer at the facility alerted team members, who called police, then analyzed CCTV footage to see who had left the money behind.

I thought it would be better to force him some way to remember—at least once a week—what he did,  said Thomas Towers, the victim's father.  I think this does that.  The sentence didn't go into detail about what Gaudioso should write in his letters, but it did specify that if he doesn't turn one in weekly, postage attached, to his probation officer, he'll face 15 years in prison. The unusual punishment is part of a trend in  creative sentencing  which utilize public shame, like wearing a giant chicken costume or a sandwich-sign that reads  I STOLE FROM THIS STORE.  Many legal scholars sharply criticize the practice as a reversal of a history of increasingly impersonal penalties:  There is a sharp difference between shame from a punishment and shame as the punishment,  a Georgetown constitutional law professor says.

"(Oct 16, 2013  1:03 AM CDT) Cleveland has suspended a sizable chunk of its police department over a car chase last year that left two unarmed suspects riddled with bullets after a pursuit involving 63 cars. The city's chief of police says 63 of the 104 officers involved will be suspended for up to 10 days for  administrative charges ranging from excessive speed to insubordination,  the Plain Dealer reports. One police supervisor has already been fired, two demoted, and nine suspended over the incident, and the department has yet to deal with the 13 officers who fired 137 shots into the car, killing the driver and his passenger. The chase began on November 29 last year when police thought they heard a gunshot from the car of Timothy Russell, 43. He refused to stop for officers and was shot dead along with Malissa Williams, 30, after a chaotic 23-minute chase. No weapons were found in the vehicle and investigators now believe the  gunshot  police heard was the sound of Russell's 1979 Chevy backfiring, reports Reuters. Cleveland's mayor says his department is  not throwing officers under the bus for political reasons and we're not covering anything up.   Prosecutors haven't decided whether to charge the 13 officers involved in the shooting.","Cleveland Suspends 63 Cops Over Massive, Deadly Chase","Cleveland Suspends ____ Cops Over Massive, Deadly Chase",63,Copy( 63 ),0

That’s almost seven times the number of domestic-response troops 5 years ago—a move that would have been  unbelievable  before 9/11, says a defense official. Critics worry that the assignment signals an executive-power expansion and undermines a 130-year-old law restricting domestic military deployment. Three rapid-reaction forces will be prepared to confront chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive attacks that might overwhelm civilian authorities, the Post notes. The military began readying for a homeland WMD attack under Clinton, and operations picked up steam under the Bush administration, but funding and troop commitments were only made recently.","US Readies 20,000 Troops Against Homeland Threats",US Readies ____ Troops Against Homeland Threats,"20,000","Copy( 20,000 )",0

Instead, they argued, the government should give money directly to banks for them to lend. Too bad Paulson listened, writes Steven Pearlstein in the Washington Post, because he's blundered away $125 billion. Now these same folks are shocked that banks are not lending, but paying dividends, paying off executives or building their capital reserves. Paulson never should have abandoned his original strategy, which stood a good chance at succeeding, nor should he have forced banks to take no-strings-attached money they didn’t need. But now that they have the cash, it’s theirs, not ours.

A Florida jury added an extra $25 million in punitive damages on Monday against Gawker Media, its founder, and its former top editor, for posting excerpts of a sex tape featuring the former pro wrestler, USA Today reports.  Just spoke to a juror,  tweets WTSP reporter Jennifer Titus, who asked whether the jury was sending a message to Gawker-affiliated websites.  I think we did,  the juror said. The decision means Gawker Media chief Nick Denton has to pay $10 million out of his own pocket and former Gawker editor AJ Daulerio, who chose to post the excerpts, must pay $100,000. But the initial $115 million award  is already far beyond their means,  Gawker attorney Michael Berry told the jury before the latest ruling, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Heather Dietrick, general counsel and president of Gawker, said she's confident the company will win on appeal.  There is so much this jury deserved to know and, fortunately, that the appeals court does indeed know,  she writes. According to Dietrick, Hogan had said he knew he was making a sex tape, had made other tapes with the wife of former friend Bubba Clem, and sent text messages to Clem  that undermine this case.  But Hogan, née Terry Bollea, saw reason to celebrate.  I think we made history today, because I think we protected a lot of people today who may be going through what I went through,  he said outside the courthouse, Reuters reports.

The US economy shrank by an unprecedented 33% annual rate in the April-to-June quarter, reports the Wall Street Journal. It is by far the worst figure for gross domestic product since such records began in 1947, notes the AP, with the previous high being a 10% fall in 1958. By the reckoning of CNBC, economic activity in America hasn't plunged this much in a quarter since 1921. As bad as the GDP number is, however, it's not as high as the prediction of 35% by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. It  just highlights how deep and dark the hole is that the economy cratered into in Q2,  says Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics.  It’s a very deep and dark hole, and we’re coming out of it, but it's going to take a long time to get out.  The GDP is expected to show a strong resurgence in the third quarter, perhaps by an annual rate of 17% or so, though rising coronavirus cases and lockdowns are putting a new damper on expectations.

Jenkins, the 16-volume Left Behind series sold more than 80 million copies worldwide, Moore said, and popularized a Bible interpretation that said born-again Christians will be instantly taken to God in the rapture, while those left behind on earth endure seven years of tribulation. LaHaye was a key figure in conservative political groups, encouraging the Rev. Jerry Falwell to create the Moral Majority and forming the Council for National Policy, a secretive strategy group for prominent political and religious conservatives. Along with his wife, Beverly, he started Concerned Women for America in 1979, as an alternative to liberal feminist organizations. LaHaye was also a prolific nonfiction writer, writing more than 60 additional books, including the Christian sex manual The Act of Marriage. Born in 1926, LaHaye had a hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, served in the Air Force at the end of World War II and graduated from Bob Jones University. He earned a midcareer doctorate at Western Seminary in Portland, Ore., and joined the Southern Baptist Convention.

Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud—identified by the New York Times as the buyer—is, however, close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and might be exempt from his crackdown on corruption. Documents seen by the Times show that Bader, one of 5,000 Saudi princes, told officials at Christie's auction house that he made his money in real estate. Bidding for  Salvator Mundi,  the only da Vinci in private hands, was down to Bader, bidding anonymously through a representative, and another bidder after $260 million. Bader won with a $30 million jump for his final bid. The Washington Post notes that one of the things that makes the buy surprising is the fact that the painting is of Jesus. He is considered a prophet in Islam, and most Muslims consider visual portrayals of the prophets to be sacrilege.

An internal company investigation of claims about the show was prompted by a BuzzFeed News report in July based on 36 interviews with ex-staffers, who complained about or said they witnessed improper and unfair treatment. Most of the allegations were tied to executive producers and senior managers, including Glavin, Leman, and Norman, BuzzFeed News said. The people making the claims against them were not identified. DeGeneres informed staff of the shakeup Monday in a video conference call, according to Variety, which first reported the development. She said she found claims about the show's environment to be  heartbreaking,  the trade publication said, citing unidentified sources. In a July statement, Warner Bros. said parent company WarnerMedia's investigation revealed what it called  some flaws in the show’s daily management.  Although not all of the allegations were corroborated, the studio said it was  disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show’s day-to-day management.  No details were specified at the time, and Warner Bros. had no further comment Monday beyond confirming the producers' departures.

Police say the starving children were living with five adults in an underground trailer near Amalia, NM, the BBC reports. The compound was searched after officers watching the property received a message that said:  We are starving and need food and water.

Two men, described by the sheriff as heavily armed, uncooperative, and possible Islamic extremists were arrested. Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were detained and later released. Police say one of the men, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, has been charged with abducting his 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, from Jonesboro, Ga., last year.

The curse was supposedly cast during the 1945 World Series, when Billy Sianis, the owner of Billy Goat Tavern, is said to have shown up at the ballpark with his pet goat, Murphy. The goat wasn't allowed entry by Cubs owner PK Wrigley himself because it reeked, the Washington Post notes, and Sianis reportedly screamed in a rage outside the park:  The Cubs ain't gonna win no more!

Barris died of natural causes Tuesday at his home in Palisades, New York, according to publicist Paul Shefrin. Barris made game show history right off the bat, in 1966, with The Dating Game, hosted by Jim Lange. The gimmick: a young female questions three males, hidden from her view, to determine which would be the best date. Sometimes the process was switched, with a male questioning three females. But in all cases, the questions were designed by the show's writers to elicit sexy answers. Celebrities and future celebrities who appeared as contestants included Michael Jackson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Martin, and a pre-Charlie's Angels Farrah Fawcett. The grinning, curly-haired Barris became a familiar face as creator and host of The Gong Show, which aired from 1976 to 1980. The program featured performers who had peculiar talents and, often, no talent at all. When the latter appeared, Barris would strike an oversize gong, the show's equivalent of vaudeville's hook. As The Gong Show and Barris' other series were slipping, he sold his company for a reported $100 million in 1980 and decided to go into films. He directed and starred in The Gong Show Movie, a thundering failure. Afterward, a distraught Barris checked into a New York hotel and wrote his autobiography, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. In it, he claimed to have been a CIA assassin, though the book (it was made into a 2002 film) was widely dismissed by disbelievers who said Barris had allowed his imagination to run wild.

Instead of using funds to buy up troubled securities as initially intended, the focus will now shift to purchasing bank equity—in essence partially nationalizing banks. It's the same tactic the British government began last week. White House officials derided a similar proposal by Democrats just last month.

The winning numbers were 16-19-32-34-57 and the Powerball number 13. All six numbers must be correct to win, although the first five can be in any order.

"(Feb 28, 2017  10:56 AM) In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, a 38-year-old man has been sentenced to time behind bars because he lost control of his drone. Paul Skinner, who owns an aerial photography business in Washington state, was found guilty of reckless endangerment in January and handed a $500 fine plus 30 days in jail in Seattle Municipal Court on Friday after an incident during Seattle's Pride Parade in 2015, per the BBC. Skinner’s drone—about 18 inches square and weighing two pounds, per Engadget—flew into a building, then dropped onto a crowd of people below, knocking a woman unconscious and leaving her with a concussion, reports the Seattle Times. A man also suffered minor bruises. Judge Willie Gregory acknowledged Skinner hadn't meant to hurt anyone but said he  put people in danger of being injured.  A prosecutor added drone  operators should know that we will continue to go after them when they disregard public safety.  But Skinner's lawyer, who plans to appeal, tells the Times his client is being made an example of—a drone expert told the court he wasn't aware of a similar case involving a drone hobbyist sentenced to jail time—and his sentence is  too severe.  With or without an appeal, Skinner will need to complete a drone safety course. A hearing scheduled for May will also determine how much restitution should be paid to the woman he injured.

The unreleased video  appears to depict multiple officers working together to manufacture evidence,  according to the city's public defender. The news comes less than two weeks after a separate video was released seeming to show a police officer planting drugs in an alley while with two other officers. The latest video involves different officers, reports the Baltimore Sun. It shows authorities repeatedly searching a vehicle during a November 2016 traffic stop but finding nothing, lawyer Debbie Katz Levi of the public defender's office tells WBFF. Later, she says, an officer looks like he places an item in the car. Two officers are under investigation, but Levi says the video shows  approximately six officers standing around while this suspected misconduct is taking place,  per CBS Baltimore. The public defender's office said it would not release the video because one of the suspects featured in the video isn't a client; meanwhile, charges were dropped Monday in this case. Days earlier, the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office announced 34 drug or weapons cases had been dropped in connection with a Jan. 24 body-cam video allegedly depicting officer Richard Pinheiro planting drugs in the company of officers Hovhannes Simonyan and Jamal Brunson.

"(Apr 2, 2020  9:40 AM CDT) The four men jailed in Pakistan for the 2002 kidnapping and beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl are set to walk free. British national Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh has been awaiting the outcome of an appeal since he was sentenced to death for murder, terrorism, and kidnapping for ransom in 2002. It came Thursday, with a Karachi court overturning the murder and terrorism convictions—US authorities say alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admitted while housed at Guantanamo Bay in 2007 to killing the journalist five years earlier, though his confession wasn't part of the appeal—and downgraded the final charge to kidnapping, reports the Journal. Sheikh, 46, was  given seven years for the kidnapping  but  has already served 18 years, so ... he will be out in a few days,  defense lawyer Khawaja Naveed Ahmed says, per the Guardian. The three co-accused, Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil, and Salman Saqib, who were serving life sentences, were acquitted by the high court of Sindh province, per the AP.  Most of the evidence against these men was not collected, but created,  Ahmed tells the Journal. Faiz Shah, the provincial prosecutor general, says he will  probably  appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, per the Guardian. Testimony from the 2002 trial indicated Pearl was duped by Sheikh, who'd offered to introduce him to a cleric. The journalist investigating religious extremism was instead taken to a compound and beheaded, as seen in a video shared online.

According to Jeffrey Reinhardt's $49,000 lawsuit, he suffered a compressed disc and tears to his back and neck muscles after being bashed by the suitcase on the January 2013 flight from Portland, Ore., to Las Vegas, Fox reports. Reinhardt, who says the suitcase fell after a flight attendant came over to help the passenger, is seeking $10,000 for medical bills, $5,000 for lost income, and $34,000 for pain and suffering. Reinhardt's suit holds the airline responsible for allowing the passenger to bring the oversized suitcase on board and for failing to train the flight attendant on putting luggage in the overhead bins, although he isn't seeking damages from his fellow passenger, reports the Oregonian. A 1998 study found that baggage falling from overhead bins injures around 4,500 passengers every year, reports Mashable, which notes that while lawsuits aren't that common, there is apparently at least one lawyer out there specializing in  overhead bin malfunctions.

He raked that in by investing in two hijacking ventures and personally hijacking a third ship. What does all that cash get him?

The Perth, Australia, attraction—if it can be called that—is a house colored an Instagram-perfect shade of blue sitting on the Swan River. CNN reports it's the  most photographed travel attraction  in the city, and that has caused a problem. Located near a residential neighborhood, there are no public bathrooms nearby. That will soon change. The Perth City Council in late May approved funding for the installation of a solar-powered toilet, at a cost of $278,000. The council cited complaints from a nearby restaurant owner who said visitors were increasingly using his facilities at a cost to him, and that there had been incidents of vandalism and verbal abuse involving them. The new toilet is expected to be completed by August. Australian Geographic reports the original boatshed was thought to have been erected in that location in the 1930s; it was rebuilt over the years.

The final vote on the two-year measure was 64-36 in the Senate. The House approved the bill last week. The legislation is designed to prevent the kind of budget brinkmanship that has prevailed over the past three years of divided government and that led to this October's partial government shutdown. The White House supports the bill, and Obama's signature is assured. The legislation, which cleared the Republican-controlled House by a wide margin, met the short-term political needs of Republicans, Democrats, and the White House. As a result, there was no suspense about the outcome of the vote in the Senate—only about fallout in the 2014 elections and, more immediately, its impact on future congressional disputes over spending and the nation's debt limit.",Senate Passes 2-Year Budget Deal,Senate Passes ____-Year Budget Deal,2,Trans( two ),1
"(Dec 21, 2020  5:03 PM) Cheating on a math test at the US Military Academy, which is facing its worst cheating scandal in more than 40 years, can be a national security issue, a West Point law professor says.  There's no excuse for cheating when the fundamental code for cadets is that they should not lie, cheat or steal,  Tim Bakken says.  Therefore when the military tries to downplay effects of cheating at the academy, we're really downplaying the effects on the military as a whole.  Officials said more than 70 cadets cheated on a math exam taken remotely because of the pandemic, USA Today reports, 58 of whom have admitted it. West Point's chief of staff said Monday that the cheating wasn't a serious violation and wouldn't have happened if the cadets had been on campus. Others were more troubled.  It's very sad,  said a 79-year-old Army veteran, per the Times Herald-Record.  In these times, the way things are going, people are doing desperate things.  Rep. Jackie Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said greater transparency is required to get to the bottom of the issue.  Our West Point cadets are the cream of the crop and are expected to demonstrate unimpeachable character and integrity,  she said.  They must be held to the same high standard during remote learning as in-person.  Academy officials said this cheating scandal isn't as serious as the one in 1976, when 153 cadets resigned or were kicked out over an electrical engineering test.  They're early in their developmental process,  one said.  And so on occasion, these incidents happen, but we have a system in place to deal with them when they do.

A judge made the ruling Friday in a lawsuit brought by conservatives who argued that the state should have voided the registrations of people who did not respond within 30 days to a letter asking them to verify their addresses, the AP reports. The state Elections Commission argues that the power to manage the registered voter list is its alone. The panel, whose membership is split evenly between the two parties, says taking people off the list now would add confusion for those voters who had not moved, per the Washington Post. Because Milwaukee and places with college campuses had the largest shares of voters whose registrations were on the line, Democrats fear they'll be affected more than Republicans. That could complicate their efforts to carry Wisconsin in the presidential election next year; President Trump carried the state by fewer than 23,000 votes last time.

Now she has come forward, though anonymously, in a new lawsuit against Epstein's estate, reports the Wall Street Journal. The woman says she was 14 when an older teenage girl from the neighborhood brought her to meet Epstein at his Manhattan mansion around 2002. He asked her age, then disrobed for a massage that became sexual, she says. Afterward, Epstein  put on a robe and retrieved three hundred-dollar bills from his robe pocket, which he handed to (Jane) Doe,  per the New York Times. She went back regularly over the next three years, and the encounters became even more sexual, she alleges.  All told, Doe was sexually assaulted by Epstein countless times over the course of three years,  the lawsuit says, per CNN. The woman says she was an easy target because she was poor and desperate for money. She made even more cash if she recruited other young women, according to the lawsuit, and she stopped going to school to spend most of her time  gratifying him sexually.

In August, a hunter shot an elderly roe deer bearing a single, centered antler in the forests of Slovenia, reports National Geographic. It's not uncommon to find deer with just a  spike —what a remaining antler is called after one is lost; even an injury to a buck's hind leg can cause an abnormality. But in this case, both antlers had fused into one, giving a unicorn-like appearance. This was a first for scientist Boštjan Pokorny, who confirmed the roe deer's fantastical and  untypical  deformity, which National Geographic notes was probably caused by an injury sustained as the antlers were forming, which is an annual occurrence. The roe deer lived to be quite old and was a little pudgy, leading Pokorny to infer his unusual deformity didn't hold him back in life. Meanwhile, on another continent, another hunter also recently bagged a  unicorn deer.  KULR reports Amy Calkins shot what she thought was her first buck in Washington state in mid-October—except it turned out to be a doe with a single antler. Calkins posted photos on Facebook of the deer and its four teats, and she says she later learned that a hormone imbalance caused the unusual growth. Mississippi State University's Deer Lab notes that it's  difficult to identify the particular cause of a particular buck's (or doe's) abnormality without a detailed dissection or necropsy.

A settlement between GM and the Justice Department could come as early as tomorrow, though the Wall Street Journal—citing  people familiar with the matter —warns any deal could still fall apart.

The Journal reports the settlement will likely come with a charge of criminal wire fraud against GM for making misleading statements and hiding information about the problem. For example, a government report found GM avoided using the word  stall  when discussing the issue to avoid people thinking it was a safety problem. According to sources cited by the Journal and NBC, GM will be fined somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion. The amount is expected to be less than the $1.2 billion Toyota was fined in a similar case last year because GM cooperated with the government investigation, the Journal reports.

Analysts, however, say ICE's problem is that it can't do anything about America's demand for illegal drugs.

"(Sep 28, 2012  9:38 AM CDT) Bank of America says it has agreed to pay $2.43 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit related to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of investors that bought or held Bank of America stock when the company announced its plans to buy Merrill as the banking industry and federal government struggled to contain fallout from the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Among the plaintiffs' allegations was that Bank of America and some of its officers made false or misleading statements about both companies' financial health. In announcing the proposed settlement today, Bank of America denied the allegations; it says it agreed to the settlement to get rid of the uncertainties, burden, and costs related to the lawsuit. As part of the settlement, the bank has also agreed to adopt several corporate governance policies until Jan. 1, 2015, including those related to majority voting in board member elections, annual disclosure of noncompliance with stock ownership guidelines, and other policies.

"(Apr 23, 2017  1:09 PM CDT) President Trump is proving as polarizing and vexing as candidate Trump once did: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that while Trump remains a deeply unpopular president, the people who voted for him are sticking by him. The current inhabitant of the Oval Office has a 42% approval rating among all Americans, and the Post has to go back to Dwight Eisenhower to find another president with a lower such rating at this point in the game. His disapproval numbers are also stratospheric at 59%; the previous high was Bill Clinton, who also had a bruising first 100 days, at 39%. The Post notes that Trump's predecessor's approval rating was 69% at this stage, disapproval at 26%. Fox News, though, finds the silver lining, with a staggering 96% of people who voted for Trump saying they'd do it again, while only 2% said they'd change their minds. And the president's approval rating is starkly different among Trump voters (94% like the job he's doing) and among Republicans (84%). Trump also beats Clinton's start in the percentage who say he's gotten either a great deal or a good amount done: 42% to 37%, respectively. And Trump again edges Clinton among those who feel campaign promises are being kept, 44% to 42%. Another chink in Trump's armor: Only 38% of respondents said he was honest, compared to 74% for Obama and 62% for George W. Bush. The complete poll is here.

The New York Times reports the group, which included two horses with  champion bloodlines,  was being transported in a tractor-trailer that caught fire after striking a concrete median at 3am near Trenton.

"(Jan 31, 2019  1:19 PM) Kim Davis became the most famous county clerk in the nation a few years ago when she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in Kentucky. Current Gov. Matt Bevin considers Davis, who is no longer in the job, an  inspiration  for what she did. In court, however, Bevin's attorneys say that Davis herself—or at least the county clerk office where she used to work—should have to pay nearly $225,000 in legal fees that resulted from the controversy, reports Kentucky.com. The attorneys don't think the state itself should have to pay the bills, and the matter is now being ironed out in court. The hefty bill is the result of a 2017 decision by a federal judge, who ruled that Kentucky taxpayers should cover the legal fees of the couples who sued the state. The thinking of the governors' attorneys goes like this: We don't think Davis did anything wrong, but because a federal judge ruled that she violated the civil rights of gay couples, either Rowan County or Davis herself should pay the $222,000 in legal fees, reports the AP.  The governor’s office have taken no position as to whether Ms. Davis acted unconstitutionally,  says Bevin's general counsel, Steve Pitt.  Governor Bevin does not believe that she has done so and continues to support Ms. Davis’s actions.  Davis spent five days in jail in 2015 over her refusal to issue the licenses.

The body of alleged attack mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud was positively identified Thursday, and forensics experts also confirmed the body of Hasna Aitboulahcen, said to be Abaaoud's cousin, per the Guardian. The third body found at the scene of the Saint-Denis raid has yet to be IDed, and there's some confusion on the gender: The Guardian says it's  understood to be a man,  while Sky News reports it's a female. And a lawyer for Omar Abaaoud, Abdelhamid's father, says the family is upset that Abdelhamid wasn't captured alive—not because of familial devotion, but because they want to know where Abdelhamid's younger brother Younes is, per the Times. A security source tells Reuters that a younger brother IDed as Yassine Abaaoud has been in Moroccan custody since October, though it's unclear if Younes and Yassine are the same person.

Michelle Carter was convicted in June by a judge who said her final instruction to Conrad Roy III caused his death. Carter was 17 when the 18-year-old Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in July 2014. Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz gave Carter a 2½-year jail sentence but said she had to serve only 15 months of that. He also sentenced her to five years of probation. He granted a defense motion that would keep Carter out of jail until her appeals in Massachusetts courts are exhausted. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, had asked the judge to spare his client any jail time and instead give her five years of probation and require her to receive mental health counseling. Prosecutor Maryclare Flynn called probation  just not reasonable punishment  for Carter's role in Roy's death. The prosecution sought the maximum sentence of 20 years. Cataldo argued that Roy was determined to kill himself and nothing Carter did could change that. Cataldo also argued that Carter's words amounted to free speech protected by the First Amendment. In convicting Carter, the judge focused his ruling on Carter telling Roy to  get back in  after he climbed out of his truck as it was filling with carbon monoxide and told her he was afraid.

Kobach said Trump's transition team is considering dusting off the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which Kobach himself helped design as a member of George W. Bush's Justice Department in the wake of 9/11. Under the program, people from nations deemed high-risk had to undergo interrogations, fingerprinting, and, in some cases, periodic check-ins upon entering the US. The program, NSEERS, was abandoned in 2011.  These programs had Kobach's signature all over them,  the director of the Migration Policy Institute tells NBC News.  Now, the architect of the old program again has a seat at the table.  Kobach, in fact, is rumored to be on Trump's list of attorney general candidates, reports McClatchy. Meanwhile, a spokesman for a pro-Trump super PAC has drawn attention for saying the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII could serve as a model for Trump's policy on Muslim immigrants.  We've done it based on race, we've done it based on religion, we've done it based on region,  Carl Bigbie of the Great America PAC told Fox News, per Politico.  Come on, you’re not proposing we go back to the days of internment camps, I hope,  responded Megyn Kelly.  I’m not proposing that at all,  Higbie responded.

Cecilio Lopez was hurt when he fell about 16 feet inside the Inti Machay cave in a ravine in Leimebamba district. Rescuers brought 44-year-old Lopez out of the mouth of the cave yesterday to cheers from an international team of 107 people who joined in the effort to get him out. The rescuers, who included 58 Spaniards, hugged each other in excitement. Rescuers said they had been getting food, water, and medicine to Lopez, but his extraction was made difficult by the remoteness of the cave and the cavern itself, which narrows at places. Doctors previously diagnosed Lopez as having two injured lumbar vertebras and he was carried into a tent and kept lying on the rescue stretcher.

Some of the world's foremost water scientists say the planet will have to cut its consumption of animal-based products from 20% to about 5% by 2050, assuming we want to feed the additional 2 billion people who are projected to occupy the Earth by that date. Basically, we need to figure out how to squeeze more food out of our existing land and water, and a vegetarian diet uses five to 10 times less water than animal-based foods, reports the Guardian.  The UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. This will place additional pressure on our already stressed water resources,  reads the report, whose release coincides with the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm. And water supply issues won't be limited to food: The report notes that the need to feed more will come as  we also need to allocate more water to satisfy global energy demand—which is expected to rise 60% over the coming 30 years—and to generate electricity for the 1.3 billion people currently without it.",You May Have to Turn Vegetarian by 2050,You May Have to Turn Vegetarian by ____,2050,Copy( 2050 ),0

It's not exactly overwhelming (especially in light of the fact that some 70% of emails sent are spam), but spam accounts for one in 200 social media posts, Mashable reports. The findings are based on Nexgate's review of 60 million items from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and YouTube from 2011 to 2013; it found Facebook and YouTube are the most spam-heavy networks. And it's  not just in the increase in volume  we should consider, says Nexgate's CEO. There's also been  increasing sophistication and diversification of the mechanisms used to distribute spam.  (One example: An app that promises to show how many Facebookers have viewed your profile that is actually, you guessed it, spam.)

The rate dropped because a survey of households found the number of employed Americans rose by 541,000. Overall, however, the total number of people who have lost jobs during the recession is now estimated to be 8.4 million. Many economists say businesses are reluctant to add workers because it's not clear whether the recovery will continue once government stimulus measures, such as tax credits for home buyers, end.

"(Jan 2, 2016  8:19 AM) A woman who was shot after being sexually assaulted in 1992 became a homicide victim when she died in November, the New York City Medical Examiner’s office has decided. Charlene Thomas, who was 65 when she died, was 41 years old when she was attacked in her home by then-23-year-old Eric Shaw. He was sentenced to a maximum of 18 years in prison for attempted murder and sodomy but served additional time because of prison contraband offenses and state inmate records show that he was released on parole in March of 2015, reports the New York Daily News. Police say Thomas died as a result of her gunshot wound, and the crime is now considered a homicide. It's not clear whether Shaw will face additional charges, reports the Daily News, which notes that in recent days, NYC authorities have decided that two other decades-old crimes were homicides because of deaths in 2015. The August death of a man shot in a nightclub in 1979 was ruled a homicide, as was the March death of Roy Evans, who was stabbed outside a Harlem bar in 1969. CBS New York reports that the medical examiner concluded that spinal cord injuries and sepsis from the stab wound contributed to the 75-year-old's death.

That was because the gift from great-aunt Alison came with a special instruction:  On the plain white box was a card that read, 'Do not open until your 1st disagreement,'  Kathy Gunn wrote in a post on the Love What Matters Facebook page, spotted by UPI.  Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments, and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,  writes Gunn.  There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box.  Doing that, she says,  would have symbolized our failure.

"(Jul 5, 2015  6:45 PM CDT) A teenager's punishment for sleeping with an underage girl has sparked yet another effort in the movement to reform sex-offender laws, the New York Times reports. Last December, 19-year-old Zachery Anderson of Elkhart, Indiana, met a girl on the dating app Hot or Not, met her in person on Dec. 19, and had sex with her at a Michigan playground. Worried about her whereabouts, the girl's mother called police—who eventually arrested Anderson because the girl was 14, not 17 like she'd told him. Anderson pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct, was sentenced in April to 90 days in jail, and has been placed on a sex-offender registry for 25 years, reports WNDU. He'll be out on Thursday and will have to keep away from public places and allow authorities to search his home every three months. And during his 5-year probation, Anderson can't own a computer, use a smartphone, or continue his computer-related degree, the South Bend Tribune reports. WNDU noted in May he had to abandon his major and would probably lose his scholarship. Anderson's parents, the girl, and her mother all appealed for leniency, and Michigan has a law (the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act) that actually allows first-time offenders between ages 17 and 21 to receive a lighter sentence. But instead the judge lectured Anderson about online hookups:  Meet, hook up, have sex, sayonara,  he said.  Totally inappropriate behavior.  The head of an advocacy group aiming to reform sex-offender laws says Anderson's case (she terms it a conviction  on steroids ) is common, and often ruins people's careers. But changing laws is difficult, Brenda V. Jones says, because lawmakers are nervous about being  soft on sex offenders.  Meanwhile, Anderson's family is trying to find him a new home to accommodate sex-offender laws while their lawyer tries to withdraw Anderson's guilty plea; an Aug. 5 hearing is planned.

A federal jury in West Virginia convicted Blankenship of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards. The misdemeanor charge carries up to one year in prison. Jurors did not find Blankenship guilty of a more serious conspiracy charge included in the same count that could have netted five years in prison. He was also acquitted of making false statements and securities fraud. He was charged with conspiring to break safety laws and defrauding mine regulators at West Virginia's Upper Big Branch Mine, as well as lying to financial regulators and investors about safety. The mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 men.

"(Apr 4, 2012  1:00 AM CDT) At least 30 Santa Monica College students were pepper-sprayed when they chanted outside a trustees meeting last night to protest budget cuts and fee hikes.  I got pepper-sprayed with no warning,  said one student, 21, who had been standing in a hallway outside the meeting. A college spokesman, who noted pepper spray has never been used before on campus, said it was the  judgment of campus police that the crowd was getting out of hand,  reports the AP. At least two people were taken to a nearby hospital. Others standing in the hallway were overcome by the spray that filled the enclosed space, reports the Los Angeles Times.  I saw all these students rushing and they were crying,  said a 19-year-old student.  I couldn't stop coughing.  The students had planned to enter the meeting during the public comment portion. One video of the scene before the pepper-spraying shows students chanting:  Let us in  and  No cuts, no fees.  They switch to  shame on you  after students are sprayed. After they were cleared from the building, city cops were called in to  secure the perimeter.  The trustees were removed to another space, and some students were later allowed to address them from an adjoining room, according to the Times.

Turkish forces pushed further into the region Thursday, carrying out air and ground attacks against Syrian Kurdish fighters, reports Reuters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 23 Syrian Defense Force fighters have been killed, while Turkey says 277  terrorists  have been  neutralized.  Turkey also says one of its soldiers was  martyred.  The SDF says at least nine civilians have been killed by Turkish airstrikes, while Turkey says mortar fire from Kurdish forces has killed six people, including a baby, in Turkish border towns. Turkey says it plans to go no further than 19 miles into Syria. Amid international criticism of the offensive, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the European Union not to call it an  invasion,  the AP reports. He threatened to  open the gates  and allow tens of thousands of Syrian refugees into Europe. The Kurdish militia was America's ally in the fight against ISIS, and many of those fleeing the Turkish offensive say they feel betrayed, the Guardian reports.  Betrayal leaves the bitterest taste,  said a man waiting to leave Qamishli, the region's biggest city.  I am 63 years old and I have never seen anything like this,  he said.

The Republican capture of the House in '94 was made possible by retiring Democrats—some 22 of the 54 seats they picked up that year were open, while just four Democrat-held House seats will be open in  even vaguely competitive territory  next year, Kilgore writes. The Senate looks even less likely to fall to resurgent Republicans than the House, Kilgore argues, since it would require the Dems to lose 11 seats while not recapturing a single one. The GOP also won't be getting a bounce from redistricting the way it did in 1994, and President Bush's failure to win over Hispanics means just about every demographic trend is going against the party. Demographics do offer the Republicans one glimmer of hope, notes Kilgore: older voters are lot more skeptical about President Obama than their younger counterparts—and a lot likelier to vote in midterm elections.",2010 Won't See Another Republican Revolution,____ Won't See Another Republican Revolution,2010,Copy( 2010 ),0

"(Apr 30, 2019  4:14 AM CDT) There was a disturbing jump in teen and tween suicides in the month after Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why made its debut, researchers say. The researchers analyzed federal data on suicides among people 10 to 64 from Jan. 2013 through Dec. 2017 and found that the month with the most suicides among children among 10 to 17 was April 2017, the month after the show's March 31, 2017 debut. The researchers say the suicide rate among that age group remained higher for the rest of the year, with an estimated 195 more suicides in the nine months after the show aired than in the same period in preceding years, the AP reports. The series is about a teen girl's suicide, but researchers found the increase in suicides was almost entirely among boys, the New York Times reports. Study author Jeff Bridge, a suicide researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, says the teen suicide rate that April was the highest in 19 years. The show had  a very graphic depiction of the suicide death,  which can trigger other suicides, he says. The study's authors say they were unable to determine whether watching the show actually caused any suicides, though seasonal differences in the suicide rate and other factors were taken into account.  The results of this study should raise awareness that young people are particularly vulnerable to the media,  researcher Lisa Horowitz said in a release from the National Institutes of Health, which supported the study. Netflix says they have  worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly  and are looking into the latest research.

"(Jun 29, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) A federal judge on Friday prohibited President Trump from tapping $2.5 billion in military funding to build high-priority segments of his prized border wall in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. in Oakland acted on two lawsuits filed by California and by activists who contended that the money transfer was unlawful and that building the wall would pose environmental threats, per the AP.  All President Trump has succeeded in building is a constitutional crisis, threatening immediate harm to our state,  said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who led a 20-state coalition of attorneys general in one lawsuit. The decisions are in line with Gilliam's ruling last month that blocked work from beginning on two of the highest-priority projects—one spanning 46 miles in New Mexico and another covering 5 miles in Yuma, Ariz. But the fight is far from over. The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to take up the same issue of using military money next week. At issue is President Trump's February declaration of a national emergency so that he could divert $6.7 billion from military and other sources to begin construction of the wall, which could have begun as early as Monday. Trump declared the emergency after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House that led to a 35-day government shutdown. In the second suit, brought by the ACLU on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, the judge determined that the use of the $2.5 billion for two sectors of the wall was unlawful, although he rejected environmental arguments that wall construction would threaten species such as bighorn sheep.",Federal Court: $2.5B in Military Funds Can't Be Used for Wall,Federal Court: $____B in Military Funds Can't Be Used for Wall,2.5,Copy( 2.5 ),0

Kim Dong Chul had been detained in the North on suspicion of engaging in spying and stealing state secrets. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor after a brief trial in Pyongyang. North Korea's Supreme Court found Kim guilty of espionage and subversion under Articles 60 and 64 of the North's criminal code.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the country's main spy agency, has said Kim's case wasn't related to the organization in any way.

Still, she began pumping,  the rhythm of the machine and flow of breast milk, connecting mom and baby when no other connection was possible,  the Tribune writes. Addie died after 160 days in the NICU; a few weeks later, Hanson pumped for the last time, then gave away all her excess milk: 5,000 frozen ounces—that's nearly 40 gallons—or enough to feed about 22 preemies for a month, nurses say. And it's the perfect food for them, per BabyCenter, which explains the mother's body in these cases produces milk with  extra calories, vitamins, and protein.

The Daily Dot reports that the 60-year-old former host of To Catch a Predator now runs a YouTube channel called Have a Seat With Chris Hansen, and last week, Hansen showed up at the home of YouTuber Onision—who has also gone by the names Gregory Jackson, James Jackson, and Gregory Avaroe—to try to get an interview with the 34-year-old. Mashable notes that for the past few months, Hansen has been interviewing women who say Onision, who's been accused of child grooming and emotional abuse, and his spouse, Kai Avaroe, had groomed them when they were underage. When Hansen showed up at Onision's door last week, however, the YouTube star tried to flip the script by calling authorities.  Hi, uh, there's a person who's been stalking me online, and they just showed up to my house,  Onision is heard saying in the 911 call obtained by Hansen. (Listen to the full call here, or read the transcript.) When the dispatcher asks Onision if he can ID the person at his door, Onision replies:  It's Chris Hansen.  Onision says that a 19-year-old he rebuffed due to their  mental disorder  and negativity went to Hansen  and said a bunch of mean things about me, and so now this person is like, trying to aggressively pursue me in a really hateful way.  Per Insider, Hansen says his camera crew and an attorney he'd brought along remained in the street and weren't being threatening, as Onision claims.

"(Dec 21, 2016  1:59 PM) With HIV no longer a death sentence, decades-old HIV laws and the heavy sentences they carry have become more contentious. A prime and much publicized example was that of Michael L. Johnson, now 25, a Lindenwood University wrestling star at the time of his 2013 arrest who is serving 30.5 years for  recklessly  infecting a male partner with HIV and exposing four others to it. Or, was: On Tuesday, a new trial was ordered for Johnson by a Missouri appeals court, which overturned his conviction after finding the trial court did indeed  abuse its discretion  in airing portions of jailhouse phone calls Johnson made that the defense didn't get access to until the morning of the trial's first day. In Missouri's case, not disclosing your HIV status to a partner, as Johnson's accusers alleged and he denied, can be a felony. The ACLU of Missouri is backing Johnson, and as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, flagged what it (and others) perceive to be problems with the conviction and sentence: that the  law under which he is charged is based on outdated science.  Critics of such laws cite significant medical advances and note that while the person with HIV faces legal repercussions, the partner who chose to have unprotected sex does not, reported BuzzFeed last year. BuzzFeed separately reports on what was in those taped calls: Johnson saying his level of confidence that he had alerted his partners to his status was  pretty sure.  The court pointed out it was  the only evidence in the record of Johnson stating to anyone that he was not certain,  making it  highly prejudicial evidence  that Johnson's defense should have had time to prepare to for.

How did they do in 2020? A single one went to Joe Biden, giving it the always-correct crown. The honor goes to Clallam County, Wash., and ABC credits the county's makeup,  a healthy mix of Republicans, Democrats, and swing voters.  Biden ended up with a 5.5-point edge among voters in the county, population 77,000. ABC also notes another feather in Clallam County's political cap: Since the start of the 20th century, it's only aligned with the losing side in two elections, in 1968, when it voted for Hubert Humphrey instead of Richard Nixon, and 1976, when it chose Gerald Ford instead of Jimmy Carter. But the 2020 outcome puts an end to two streaks even more impressive than Clallam's, reports the New York Times: New Mexico's Valencia County had gotten it right in every presidential election since 1952; for Indiana's Vigo County, the streak dated to 1956.","19 Counties Always Picked the Right President.

The happy accident occurred during an attempt to create new materials for use in electronics when a grad student extracted a mix from the furnace and saw a brilliant blue.  You know what Louis Pasteur said?  the professor, Mas Subramanian, recently asked NPR.  Luck favors the alert mind.  The group was lucky indeed, because the blue is the first to be discovered in two centuries. The team named the blue YInMn for the elements it comprises—yttrium, indium and manganese—and it has just become commercially available as paint via the Ohio-based Shepherd Color Company, reports Quartz. Scientists also are working on an energy-saving roofing material with YInMn because the compound can resist water and sunlight better than other blues, including the last one created, cobalt blue. Expect to see it in plastics, too. Subramanian and his team also are developing other colors using YInMn, which is, as New York describes it,  part neon-blue and two parts Cookie Monster.  Meanwhile, Artnet reports that YInMn has been entered in a Harvard Art Museum pigment collection that preserves the  world history of color,  while artists are calling the color  Mas Blue —mas means  more  in Spanish and happens to be Subramanian's name.

The South African surfer has just become the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone on a stand-up paddleboard. Granted, his 1,360-pound board was a bit fancier than most. The 20-foot-long craft equipped with radio, GPS, weather forecasting equipment, solar panels, and a tiny cabin for sleeping helped Bertish overcome massive waves, intense winds, and even  shark encounters  during his 93-day venture more than 4,050 nautical miles from Agadir, Morocco, to Antigua's English Harbour, where he arrived Thursday, reports SUP Magazine. At times, it looked like he might not make it. Roughly 2 months into the trip, Bertish told SUP his craft had been taking on water for nearly two weeks due to rough conditions.  I have a sea grass growing on my entire deck because it's underwater the entire time,  he said. The New York Times reports he ended up having to  jury-rig  a dozen broken items, and suffered a torn rotator cuff that will require surgery. But he kept paddling, nabbing an additional record for longest distance traveled solo and unsupported across open ocean in a 24-hour period at 71.96 nautical miles, per NPR. He also raised more than $490,000 for three charities with the goal of building schools in South Africa, providing food for hungry kids, and funding cleft lip and palate operations, reports CNN.

Marube says he met the bears early in the morning on a dirt road in woods near Auburn, Maine, the Guardian reports. He says he can't swim, and knows better than to try to climb a tree to escape a bear, so he decided running was his only option when they charged. Marube says he managed to make it to a vacant house he had passed earlier. He got to the porch and closed the screen door with the bears just 10 yards behind him. Over the next few minutes, the two bears sniffed around the porch and looked through the screening before wandering off. Marube tells the Lewiston Sun Journal that he encountered a leopard once while running in Kenya, where he grew up, but the close call with the bears was much worse.  I don't fear lion,  he says.  I don't fear anything else. But a bear is scary.  Marube says he plans to start his runs later in the morning and will carry pepper spray in the future. Authorities in Maine say people who encounter aggressive bears are not advised to run. Instead, they should try to make themselves look larger while slowly backing away—and  remain calm  if they charge.

What was really waiting for the 32-year-old on Oct. 10 in Wisconsin's Winnebago County: an arrest, as the girl was actually an undercover cop, the Oshkosh Northwestern reports. The Washington Post lays out the online relationship Jenkins and  Kaylee Marie  allegedly started on Oct. 1, including instant messages in which the supposed teen revealed she was 14 and liked to drink, and which soon became explicit, per a police affidavit. On Oct. 6, the affidavit notes,  Kaylee  agreed to have Jenkins come to Wisconsin to get her—and he messaged her he'd started walking. It's not clear how much Jenkins actually walked, but he sent  Kaylee  pics as he made his journey, authorities say; they add he also sent a message saying he wanted to have 500 kids with her.

But the Aventa-M ventilators ended up in the trash. Not only were the models made by a subsidiary of Rostec, a Russian state-owned company under US sanctions, but they weren't of the correct electrical voltage for US hospitals and were suspected of causing fires that killed six people in Russian hospitals, as Reuters reported at the time. After Trump touted the  very nice  delivery, the ventilators ended up sitting unused in storage facilities in New York and New Jersey, per BuzzFeed. By then, Russia's health care regulator had suspended their use after the fires, reports the Moscow Times. It reauthorized the Aventa-M units in July, deciding they hadn't caused the fires, but FEMA didn't use its stock.

"(Aug 1, 2018  7:00 PM CDT) The TSA is reportedly mulling over a proposal to eliminate screenings at some airports, which would mark a major departure from the pricey, time intensive and often headache-inducing security measures put in place post-911. CNN reported Wednesday that the move would lift the requirement at 150 small and some medium-sized airports that serve aircraft with capacities no larger than 60 passengers. Per documents obtained by CNN, travelers from the affected airports who travel to larger hubs would be subject to screenings upon arrival. The move would also save serious federal cash in the range of $150 million a year, according to the documents, freeing up more money for security measures where experts feel they're more needed.

"(Jul 8, 2017  12:21 PM CDT) World powers lined up against US President Donald Trump on climate change Saturday, reaffirming their support for international efforts to fight global warming. The final statement of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, underlined that the other countries and the European Union supported the Paris climate agreement rejected by Trump, the AP reports. They called the deal to reduce greenhouse gases  irreversible  and vowed to implement it quickly and without exception. The other countries, from European powers such as Germany to emerging ones such as China and energy producers such as Saudi Arabia, merely  took note  of the US position, which was boxed off in a separate paragraph that the summit host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, made clear applied only to the United States. She said the US position was  regrettable  but that the summit had achieved  good results in some areas,  and cited a hard-won agreement on trade that does include Trump and the United States. On climate, summit deputies hashed out a three-part fudge that everyone could sign. That meant a first section with a broad pledge to fight climate change in general; a separate paragraph carved out that acknowledged the US did not support the Paris deal; and a third paragraph in which the other 19 members reaffirmed their support for the deal. Advocates for efforts against global warming expressed relief that the other countries had remained unanimous in support of the Paris accords.

The US Olympic Committee awards $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze—and the IRS then takes its cut. Depending on their tax brackets, athletes owe up fo $9,900 per gold, $5,940 for silver, and $3,960 per bronze, reports USA Today. It figures Phelps will owe about $55,000, though his net worth of $55 million means it probably won't pinch much.

Seth Lockhart has been sentenced to 12 years in prison on charges including Medicaid fraud, embezzlement, reckless endangerment, and unlawful dental acts, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Investigators said Lockhart, who was reported by a former employee, increased profits by sedating patients for longer than necessary.  In reviewing all this over and over again, I have this visceral response—you darn near killed some people,  Anchorage Superior Court Judge Michael Wolverton told Lockhart on Monday. A jury found Lockhart guilty of 46 charges in January. In the hoverboard incident, he was filmed standing on the board while extracting a tooth from an unconscious patient and then riding away with his arms raised in triumph, reports the New York Post. Prosecutors said the 34-year-old sent the video to at least eight people, boasting that it was a  new standard of care.

"(Feb 26, 2014  10:49 AM) It's been more than a year since the legal justification for secrecy expired on a collection of roughly 33,000 pages of documents from the Clinton presidency. But the files in question—which are held at the Clinton Presidential Library and are reportedly related in part to scandals such as Whitewater—remain off-limits to the public, Politico reports. Per the Presidential Records Act, such papers can be held for 12 years after a president leaves office, meaning they could have been available in January 2013. Now, following Politico inquiries, officials say the White House has OKed the release of 25,000 pages. But  it will take … additional time to complete the logistics of making available such a large release,  says a rep for the National Archives, which, along with the library and lawyers for presidents Clinton and Obama, plays a role in the release process. Politico's Mike Allen tells MSNBC that  another 8,000 of some of the president’s most sensitive communications … are still being blocked,  the Washington Free Beacon reports. The White House has delayed the deadline on those remaining pages until March 26, the rep says. Bill Clinton could use executive privilege to keep them secret, but that would probably prompt a court battle, Politico notes. Also among the documents is confidential advice Clinton requested or received, along with files from Hillary Clinton's office, and a Gettysburg College professor offers her take on the apparent secrecy:  The obvious answer is they are trying to protect Hillary,  perhaps ahead of a 2016 presidential bid of her own.",33K Pages of Clinton Files Are Still Hidden —Why?,____K Pages of Clinton Files Are Still Hidden —Why?,33,"Paraphrase( 33,000 , K )",1

"(Aug 17, 2013  4:06 PM CDT) When Lakisha Briggs' violent boyfriend showed up at her door last year, fresh from a prison stint related to their last fight, calling 911 and kicking him out was not an option, she tells the New York Times. Why? Because Norristown, Pennsylvania, where she lived, has a law that means renters who call police three times within four months face eviction—and Briggs had no calls left.  If I called the police to get him out of my house, I’d get evicted,  says Briggs, 34, who has a 3-year-old daughter.  If I physically tried to remove him, somebody would call 911 and I’d be evicted.  Days later, Briggs' boyfriend assaulted her with a broken ashtray, leaving a 4-inch stab wound in her neck. Her neighbor called 911. Norristown authorities instructed Briggs' landlord to evict her within 10 days. Norristown is just one of hundreds of cities and towns in the US with  nuisance property  or  crime-free housing  ordinances, reports the Times. The laws are intended to force landlords to deal with disruptive and law-breaking tenants, but for victims of crime, they can create an impossible choice between safety and a place to live.  These laws threaten citizens’ fundamental right to call on the police for help,  says a Harvard sociologist, whose study found a third of nuisance citations issued to landlords in Milwaukee involved domestic violence. For its part, Norristown authorities claim Briggs had ignored their instructions to get a protection order, and they'd never seen evidence of physical injury to her in 10 previous calls to her house.

On top of his game in the water. Totally content away from the pool.  It turned out pretty cool,  Phelps said, another gold medal around his neck.  It's just a perfect way to finish.  Phelps put the United States ahead to stay on the butterfly leg of the 4x100-meter medley relay, reports the AP, giving the most decorated athlete in Olympic history his 23rd career gold medal Saturday night. If that was the end, and Phelps insists it is, the numbers are simply astonishing. No other Olympian has more than nine gold medals. With 28 medals in all, he's 10 clear of anyone else.  It's not even once in a generation,  said his coach, Bob Bowman.  It might be once in 10 generations that someone like Michael Phelps comes along.

The Denver Post reports Jimma Pal Reat, his brother Ran Pal, and others were driving from Denver to their apartment in Wheat Ridge when a red Jeep pulled up next to them. The men in the Jeep yelled racial epithets at Reat and the others, and one brandished a gun. They also threw bottles and bottle rockets hard enough to break the car's window, according to Courthouse News Service. Reat and the others made it back to Wheat Ridge and called 911. Dispatcher Juan Rodriguez, who has since been fired, told them— for reasons that remain unclear,  per the court ruling—that they'd have to return to the scene of the crime if they wanted help.  I said, 'I'm here at home, this is where I feel safe so please send somebody,' Pal tells the Denver Channel.  He said, 'No. If you don't go back that way, we won't be able to send anybody, and it's going to be your loss.  After 14 minutes of begging, insisting they were hurt and afraid, Pal and the others agreed to return to Denver. They were standing outside their car when the red Jeep came back and opened fire. Reat was shot and killed, and the suspects have still not been identified. Reat's family sued Rodriguez, but the court found him not liable for Reat's death and ordered the suit dismissed. The court ruled Reat and the others were free to ignore Rodriguez's instructions.

"(Apr 7, 2020  12:06 AM CDT) Australia's highest court on Tuesday dismissed the convictions of the most senior Catholic found guilty of child sex crimes, the AP reports. Cardinal George Pell welcomed the news and said his trial had not been a referendum on the Catholic Church’s handling of the clergy sex abuse crisis. Pope Francis’ former finance minister, Pell had been the most senior Catholic found guilty of sexually abusing children and has spent 13 months in high-security prisons before seven High Court judges unanimously dismissed his convictions. The High Court found there was reasonable doubt surrounding the testimony of the witness, now the father of a young family aged in his 30s, that Pell had abused him and another 13-year-old choirboy at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne in the late 1990s.  I have consistently maintained my innocence while suffering from a serious injustice,  Pell said in his first public statement since he was convicted in December 2018. He released the statement before he was driven from the gates of Barwon Prison and past waiting media two hours after the verdict. Pell, 78, added:  I hold no ill will toward my accuser.  Pell was regarded as the Vatican’s third-highest ranking official when he voluntarily returned to Melbourne in July 2017 determined to clear his name of dozens of decades-old child abuse allegations. All the charges were dropped by prosecutors or dismissed by courts in preliminary hearings over the years except the cathedral allegations.

The New York Times reports that this has been worst summer for the film industry in North America since 1997. Ticket sales from May through August are expected to come in at $3.9 billion, down 15% from last year. While movies such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Angelina Jolie's Maleficient, and Scarlett Johansson's Lucy did relatively well, supposed blockbusters such as Edge of Tomorrow and Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn't meet expectations, and sequels in general didn't seem to have the lure they once did. Studios will surely counter that ticket sales must be counted worldwide now, not just in North America, but  what they do not often mention is that overseas ticket sales are often less profitable,  writes Brooks Barnes.

"(Sep 21, 2012  1:03 PM CDT) Mitt Romney has released his 2011 tax returns: He and wife Ann paid $1.94 million in federal taxes on last year's income of $13.7 million, for an effective tax rate of 14.1%, his campaign said today. That's slightly above the 13.9% rate the couple paid in 2010. Most of the 2011 income was from investments. Campaign officials said the couple filed the return today with the Internal Revenue Service, after receiving an extension. They were to publicly release their full 2011 returns later today. Brad Malt, the trustee of the couple's blind trust, added that Romney and his wife last year claimed a deduction for $2.25 million of their $4.02 million in charitable contributions, reports the AP. In the previous year, a large percentage of those contributions went to the Mormon Church. Critics, including President Obama, have urged Romney to release more than just the two years of returns and follow his father's model.

Germany ended up last in Group F while Sweden and Mexico advanced to the round of 16. South Korea was also eliminated despite the victory. It was the first time Germany has been eliminated in the first round since 1938, reports the AP.

Binchy's books, among them short-story collections and the novel-turned-movie Circle of Friends, have sold more than 40 million copies, and addressed the tensions of a modernizing Irish society, the Guardian notes. Her passing prompted praise from fellow writers as well as the highest levels of government.  Today we have lost a national treasure,  said Irish PM Enda Kenny.  She is a huge loss wherever stories of love, hope, generosity, and possibility are read and cherished.  Binchy got an unlikely start as a traveling youth detailing her adventures in post cards home.  My parents were so impressed with these eager letters from abroad they got them typed and sent them to a newspaper and that’s how I became a writer,  she later said. From there, she became the women's editor and then London editor for the Irish Times, until she published her first novel in 1982. She returned to Dublin when  the fax was invented so we writers could live anywhere we liked, instead of living in London near publishers.

Coast Guard members were patrolling near the island when they spotted four Mexican fishing boats about 800 yards north of the US-Mexico maritime boundary line, reports WVUE. As the Coast Guard approached, officials say the boats fled into Mexican waters. However, members found illegal longline fishing gear and gill nets left behind, along with five dead sharks and 50 live ones. The sharks were then set free in the Gulf of Mexico, along with two tripletail that were also found about 400 yards offshore.  The Coast Guard is absolutely invested and engaged daily in combating the intense illegal fishing by Mexican [fishermen] in US waters,  says a commander in Corpus Christi.

In a case report on Jo Cameron in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, scientists say they discovered two genetic mutations at play (one on a previously unidentified gene) and that the 71-year-old may be experiencing other effects beyond the lack of pain. She's had broken bones with no painful reaction; when she burns herself she can be unaware it's happening until she smells her flesh singeing, per a press release. She's had dental work done and gone through childbirth without the need for pain relief. The BBC has video of Cameron eating the fiery Scotch bonnet chili pepper and smiling through the process. But she's also an optimistic person who reports almost never panicking—including when a car accident two years ago left her vehicle upside-down on its roof, reports the Guardian; she experiences very little anxiety, is almost never afraid, and her wounds tend to heal quickly.  I didn't know anything strange was going on until I was 65,  Cameron says. That's when doctors X-rayed her hip and found massive deterioration in the joint. They couldn't believe she wasn't in pain. At 66 she had a surgery on her hands that's described as  excruciating ; again, no discomfort. That's when she was sent to pain specialists in London.  We hope that with time, our findings might contribute to clinical research for post-operative pain and anxiety, and potentially chronic pain, PTSD, and wound healing,  says study author Dr. James Cox.","Woman Feels No Pain, Didn't Realize It Until Age 65","Woman Feels No Pain, Didn't Realize It Until Age ____",65,Copy( 65 ),0
"(Nov 2, 2017  2:04 PM CDT) To say that it was an indulgent purchase would be an understatement: A Chinese millionaire paid a record $10,050 for a shot of 1878 Macallan single malt scotch in July—except it turns out the alcohol was all of 40 years old. Eyebrows were raised about the veracity of Zhang Wei's purchase after photos were posted online of Zhang posing with the bottle and the manager of the Waldhaus Am See hotel; the Swiss hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar has a 2,500-bottle collection. The prime condition of the vintage bottle, and the wording on the label didn't add up, said doubters. They were right. The BBC reports a series of lab tests were performed and returned all-around negative results. University of Oxford researchers carbon dated the sample and say there's a 95% probability it was produced between 1970 and 1972. And it's not even a single malt, as testing by alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson found it was a blend of 60% malt and 40% grain. Manager Sandro Bernasconi tells the Scotsman,  The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.  The repayment was done in what's likely the most expensive way possible: SwissInfo.ch reports Bernasconi flew to Beijing to apologize and reimburse Zhang. The Daily Meal suspects the bottle is one of a batch of fakes that were so convincing Macallan actually purchased 100 such bottles in 2002.

The state education minister specifically blames organo-phosphorus, the BBC reports, and he says investigators are looking into how it got in the food. One doctor treating the children thinks the vegetable oil the meal was cooked in, which the education secretary described as  foul-smelling,  could have been contaminated. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme, an effort to boost attendance, has had issues with poor hygiene and food poisoning in the past; it is the largest school lunch program in the world and feeds 120 million children. The incident took place at a government-run school in a village in the poor eastern state of Bihar. AFP reports that such schools are notorious for having poor kitchen hygiene. Sweltering heat probably didn't help. TV reports aired footage of sick children laid out on  wooden tables in a primitive state-run hospital.  Parents have been protesting since the deaths, and the BBC warns that the toll could rise as other children are in critical condition.

The court found that Matthew Tinling, 25, knifed his victim 17 times and tried to sever his spinal cord in a  savage and prolonged  murder—all to get his PIN number and withdraw $365 to buy crack cocaine.

The AP recounts a 1995 conversation with Keane, in which he attributed his comic's staying power to its simplicity and consistency.  It's reassuring, I think, to the American public to see the same family —in his case, Billy, Jeffy, Dolly, PJ, and their parents (wife Thelma was the inspiration for  Mommy,  and her spitting image, notes the AP).

"(Nov 11, 2014  7:03 AM) The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled  Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,  the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that  careful estimates  put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the  biggest bombshell for some.  The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed  for eternity alone,  suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were  for time and eternity ). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the  wrenching trial  of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that  the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.  Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share  reliable, faith-promoting  info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

"(Sep 30, 2020  9:30 AM CDT) The first person cured of HIV—a feat Timothy Ray Brown managed more than a decade ago—has died from cancer. He was 54. The BBC reports Brown, known as the  Berlin patient,  learned he had HIV in 1995 while living in the German city. In 2007 he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and the AP reports he underwent two bone marrow transplants from the same donor, in 2007 and 2008. The donor had a mutation that bestowed a resistance to HIV on Brown. His HIV levels became undetectable, and he stopped taking antiviral drugs. He was free of the virus until his death, which was caused by a resurgence of the cancer last year; it spread to his brain and spinal cord. He died Tuesday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif., according his partner, Tim Hoeffgen. The BBC gives context to Brown's cure, explaining it's too costly and high-risk an approach to use as a general treatment, but noting that his story  inspired scientists, patients, and the world that a cure could eventually be found.  The head of the International Aids Society said pretty much that:  We owe Timothy and his doctor, Gero Huetter, a great deal of gratitude for opening the door for scientists to explore the concept that a cure for HIV is possible.  As Brown himself wrote in 2015, when it came time to look for a bone marrow donor,  many patients do not have any matches; I had many matches, 267. This gave Dr. Huetter the idea of looking for a donor who had a mutation called CCR5 Delta 32 on the CD4 cells making them nearly immune to HIV.  A second man, Adam Castillejo, is thought to have been cured by a transplant much like Brown’s in 2016.",The First Person Cured of HIV Is Dead at 54,The First Person Cured of HIV Is Dead at ____,54,Copy( 54 ),0

Now, however, thanks to Kufrin's stint as the current Bachelorette and a new profile on Luyendyk in GQ,  the most hated bachelor in America  is back in the spotlight. Rebecca Nelson spent two days in Scottsdale, Ariz., with the 36-year-old and Burnham, a  reserved  26-year-old, and Luyendyk insists he was made into a villain by the crew and feels  100%  betrayed. He's especially irked about the supposedly unedited footage of his breakup with Kufrin, which he says was more staged than suggested. Viewers had raged that Luyendyk wouldn't leave after Kufrin told him to.  It was completely edited,  he says.  I was told to stay on that couch. I tried to leave, and then production was like, 'You need to go back inside.'  Still, Luyendyk understands the producers' role ( it's their job to make it entertaining for people ), and the rest of Nelson's stay involved tagging along with the couple as they went house hunting, hearing about how Luyendyk ended up on the show in the first place in 2011—he was a fill-in for a last-minute dropout—and learning about Luyendyk's thought process as he struggled to choose between two women. Nelson's visit with the couple didn't end on a great note: After a one-on-one with Burnham in which Nelson revealed to Burnham (who hadn't watched the finale) about a comment Kufrin had made about how she'd  challenge [Luyendyk] a lot more  than Burnham, Nelson got a text from Luyendyk.

Throughout most of American history, it's been pretty easy to call yourself Christian,  he said.  ...But things are different now.  It was certainly different from his visit in 2016, when everyone with a TV heard Trump crowing about clutching women's genitals.  Shortcomings are no excuse for inaction,  Pence told students at the time.

"(Jul 24, 2012  9:59 AM CDT) In its ongoing effort to extend the Bush tax cuts for (and only for) the bottom 98% of households, the White House today released a report calculating that the average family making less than $250,000 a year would see their taxes go up $1,600 if a deal isn't reached.  So far the only reason the middle-class tax cuts have not been extended is that Republicans in Congress continue to insist on cutting taxes once again for the wealthiest few,  the report said, according to the AP.

It's a very unique situation,  says the police chief in Aliquippa. The boy says he found the loaded .22-caliber handgun on a bed and stuffed it in his backpack because he knew his brother wouldn't look there. When he brought it to school, another student found about it and told a teacher.  He’s a very sweet kid,  a family friend tells WPXI of Pittsburgh.  He wasn’t taking the gun to school to hurt anyone.  It sounds as if police and school officials believe the boy, and police are still considering whether to file charges against the child's mother or her boyfriend. The gun isn't registered to either of them.  I just can't stop thinking about a loaded gun lying on a bed with a 3- and 5-year-old in the home,  writes Michele Zipp at the Stir.

These 42.1 million people provided an average of 18.4 hours of care per week, up 9% from the previous study in 2007. Instead of seeing themselves as  caregivers,  they  describe what they do in terms of their relationship with the other person: as a husband, wife, partner, daughter, daughter-in-law, son, grandson, niece, or close friend, for example,  said the study. The study found the average caregiver to be a 49-year-old woman who still works a full-time job and cares for her mother about five years.  The 2009 estimate of the value of family caregiving is conservative,  the study said,  because it does not quantify the physical, emotional, and financial costs of care.",AARP: Families Provide $450B in Unpaid Care,AARP: Families Provide $____B in Unpaid Care,450,Copy( 450 ),0

Once a New York liberal, Kristol grew disaffected with liberalism in the 1940s and founded conservative magazines like Encounter and the Public Interest, which had small circulations but influenced powerful audiences.

He has arthritis and a Pacemaker and uses a cane; he's served on a number of boards in the community; he used to work at a local paper plant; and he told his wife, Gennell Eubanks, that he once killed a man in  the accident that happened  decades ago—but said he never meant for it to happen, she tells the AP. Yesterday, federal agents arrested Miller on 33-year-old murder charges after tracking him to Mineola, and Miller was quick to confess. They say Miller shot a man in the head in a parking lot outside a hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1981. The victim, Thomas Waller, was found dead inside his car. Miller was charged with murder and three other felonies, but fled the state. Investigators got a tip that he had been living in Mexico under the name of his deceased cousin, and used that information to trace him to Texas. Miller's wife says her husband claimed he was trying to help his brother during a fight when Waller was killed, and that his relatives in Pennsylvania  didn't want him to come back. They told him to leave.  Oddly, Miller also pleaded guilty in a 1959 murder, but his life sentence was commuted in 1971 after he had served more than 11 years, the Patriot-News reports.

Though the Senate passed the bill and the House had been expected to pick it up last night, Boehner announced late that the decision would have to wait until the new session of Congress, which begins tomorrow. This likely means that the Senate will have to vote anew on the package. A bipartisan cadre of legislators from affected districts blasted the delay, with New York Rep.

"(Jun 15, 2016  8:07 AM CDT) It started with a conversation last year that Michelle Moon had with her terminally ill daughter, Julianna, about where she'd want to be if she got sick again: in the hospital or at home. Julianna picked home, even if it meant she'd die there, and that's where the 5-year-old peacefully passed away Tuesday, CNN reports.  Our sweet Julianna went to heaven today,  Moon wrote on her blog.  I am stunned and heartbroken, but also thankful. … We got almost six years together.  In her post, Moon also documented the fight Julianna had waged against her incurable Charcot-Marie-Toot disease and the  startling  words she'd speak that seemed to suggest a more mature understanding of terminal illness than most would expect. Still, Moon, a neurologist, and her husband, Steve Snow, an Air Force pilot, were thrown by the backlash after a CNN story on their family in October.  They are Steve's and my decisions, but we look to Julianna to guide us,  Moon rebutted to People in January. And medical experts who worked with the family supported their decision: One hospice nurse said,  I don't know that it's appropriate for every child, but in this scenario it's very appropriate.  What hurt the most, Moon says, were judgmental attacks—including the Dear Julianna website, which shows people with neuromuscular disabilities who survived to adulthood—based on a misperception she and her husband had deprived Julianna of medical care. CNN explains doctors had told Julianna's parents if she chose the hospital, there was a  reasonable chance  she'd die anyway and that she'd spend her last days mostly sedated and undergoing painful medical procedures. Instead, Julianna's final bout was quick, Moon told CNN, and  she died at home … in my arms.

It's likely they never would have sold had they known Palij's past—he served as a Nazi prison guard at a death-camp in Poland, then lied about that in order to enter the US after the war, say Justice Department officials. On Monday, immigration officials rousted the 95-year-old from his Queens residence and shipped him to Germany to face possible war crimes charges, reports ABC News. Palij is believed to be the last Nazi war crimes suspect in the US who had been facing deportation. He is now in a German nursing home as prosecutors there try to figure out if they have enough evidence to convict, reports the Washington Post. Palij's Nazi history has been long known. A fellow guard at the Trawniki camp tipped off authorities back in 1989, per the AP, and investigators first confronted him a few years later. In 2001, he finally admitted he worked as a guard, but said he did so because he feared he'd be killed otherwise.  I know what they say, but I was never a collaborator,  Palij told the New York Times back in 2003, the year his US citizenship was revoked. The US tried to deport him then, but Germany, Poland, Ukraine all refused to take him. The US says Monday's deportation took place after  extensive negotiations  with Germany.

An FTC complaint says the fund and three related charities—the Breast Cancer Society, the Children's Cancer Fund of America, and Cancer Support Services—spent just 3% of donations on cancer patients and used much of the rest to pay for things like college tuition, consumer goods, luxury cruises, and even dating site memberships for family and friends, the Wall Street Journal reports. The organizations are accused of scamming donors out of $187 million between 2008 and 2012. The FTC complaint calls the organizations  sham charities  operated as  personal fiefdoms  by James T.

That price tag doesn't get Microsoft Minecraft creator Markus Persson (who hasn't held his tongue about Microsoft in the past), nor the Stockholm-based gaming company's two other founders, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Journal sees the buy as a partially surprising one for Satya Nadella, who, after taking the helm in February, said Microsoft needed to focus on selling software. But the Verge and the Journal run down three things the acquisition of the insanely popular Lego-like multiplayer game's maker gets Microsoft: It gives Microsoft  an asset with a loyal and largely young following,  could help the company woo developers, and gives Microsoft the ability to add game features available only on Windows. (There currently isn't a Windows Phone version of the game, but the Verge sees that coming; the game will continue to be available on iOS and Android.) An interesting side note: the Verge points out that Microsoft can use cash held overseas to foot the bill,  rather than bringing funds back to the US and getting taxed on a similar buyout back home.  As for Persson,  He’s decided that he doesn’t want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance,  says Mojang.  He'll continue to do cool stuff though.

"(Jul 23, 2020  5:19 AM CDT) Reports of people recovering from COVID-19 and then becoming sick again within months make the coronavirus seem like an almost unstoppable enemy—but virologists say fears may be overblown. Experts tell the New York Times that while it may be possible for people to become infected twice, they believe it would be very unlikely to happen within the space of a few months, or for the person to become much sicker the second time. They suspect that in at least some cases of reported reinfections, the person was wrongly declared virus-free after a test returned a false negative when the coronavirus was still lurking somewhere in their body. Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen tells the Washington Post that while experts hope immunity for recovered patients will last at least a year, it is too early in the pandemic to draw conclusion about how immunity develops or how long it persists. Michael Mina, a Harvard immunologist, says while reports that antibodies decline sharply two or three months after infection have caused alarm, he says it is completely normal for antibody levels to go very, very, high then come down after an acute infection. Clinicians are  scratching their heads, saying 'What an extraordinarily odd virus that it’s not leading to robust immunity,’ but they’re totally wrong,  Mina tells the Times.  It doesn’t get more textbook than this.  He describes reports raising fears of widespread reinfection are  sensationalist clickbait.  Experts also note that reinfections have been known to happen with many viruses, and with 15 million known coronavirus cases worldwide, reports of reinfection have been very rare.

"(May 2, 2018  2:27 AM CDT) California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its plan to scrap Obama-era auto-emissions standards that would require vehicles to get significantly higher gas mileage by 2025. At issue is a move by Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to roll back 2012 rules aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Under those rules, vehicles would have to get 36 miles of real-world driving per gallon, about 10 miles over the existing standard.  Pollutants coming out of vehicles, out of the tailpipe, does permanent lung damage to children living near well-traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact.

"(Nov 21, 2014  8:57 AM) The watery grave of more than 500 people has been found off the coast of New Zealand after more than a century—but most of those aboard were already dead when the SS Ventnor sank in 1902. The steamer was carrying the exhumed remains of 499 Chinese gold miners back to their homeland when it hit a reef and sank about 13 miles off Hokianga Harbor in the far north of New Zealand, TVNZ reports; 13 crew members perished. In the years after the wreck, bones would occasionally wash ashore and would be buried with respect by the local Maori, but the ship's location was a mystery until it was found in 2012 with an echo sounder; using footage taken by an unmanned sub the next year, the ship's identity was confimed. The miners had died and been buried at various locations in New Zealand, but money was raised to return their remains to China so that their souls could be at rest and their graves tended by family members. Divers have yet to spot human remains, and it's not clear whether the dead will now finally make it back to China. But the great-great-great-granddaughter of one of the miners being transported by the ship tells stuff.co.nz,  For me it's about my children's heritage as well, and it would be nice to see him make the trip home.

Alberto Zerain Berasatei of Spain and Mariano Galacan of Argentina were part of a team that began climbing the world's ninth-highest mountain, Nanga Parbat, this month. But while all other team members have returned to base camp, Berasatei, 55, and Galacan, 37, are missing, reports Reuters. The owner of tour company Summit Karakoram, which arranged the climb, tells AFP the pair reached a height of 20,000 feet last week but were then forced to spend three days in a tent due to bad weather.  They pushed for the summit again as the weather got better but lost contact with our staff,  he says. The owner adds sherpas believe the climbers are above 23,000 feet on the 26,660-foot-tall mountain, a height he says is  impossible  for rescuers—though Reuters reports rescuers were scouring the mountain Wednesday as poor weather kept helicopters grounded. A rep for Summit Karakoram tells Xinhua that the  altitude is not considered dangerous, but the two mountaineers chose the hardest route which has been successfully completed only once in history.  Hopes of finding the men alive don't appear to be high.  In such weather conditions and without adequate food supply, survival appears unlikely,  says a rep for the Alpine Club of Pakistan.

According to US officials, the commandos managed to free 27-year-old Philip Walton in Nigeria while killing six of his seven captors.  They were all dead before they knew what happened,  said an unidentified counterterrorism source. The governments of Niger, Nigeria, and the US are said to have joined forces in rescuing Walton, a missionary who was kidnapped Monday from his home on a farm in Niger. Sources said the armed assailants demanded money, but he offered only $40, and was abducted by force. It seems the kidnappers were bandits rather than terrorists, but captives are often sold to terror groups. A counterterrorism official said concern grew that the situation would escalate if Walton fell into the hands of Islamists associated with ISIS or al-Qaeda, so the SEAL Team swung into action. Walton is now said to be safe, and none of the US commandos were injured.  Thanks to the extraordinary courage and capabilities of our military, the support of our intelligence professionals, and our diplomatic efforts, the hostage will be reunited with his family,  said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, per CNN.

In a Facebook posting, police say the pond owner alerted officers in Chalons-en-Champagne, 100 miles east of Paris, on Monday about the discovery. The car became visible because drought dropped the water level. After police divers checked there wasn't a corpse inside, the long-lost vehicle was towed onto dry land.  lt still looks like a 104.

The record-setting bid at Tuesday's sale in Jerusalem far surpassed estimates of $5,000 to $8,000, per Winner's auction house.

"(Aug 6, 2012  11:30 AM CDT) Even lawyers can be taken in by email scams—and one US Postal Inspector estimates law firms have lost at least $70 million to such scams since 2009, the Wall Street Journal reports. Scammers email lawyers—known for their eagerness to gain new clients, often via the Internet—with a convincing tale of woe. The con artist says he needs the law firm's help collecting money from a legal settlement or debtor, then sends a sophisticated counterfeit cashier's check to the firm. All the lawyers have to do, the scammer explains, is take out their fee and return the balance of the check to an overseas account. Only—as anyone familiar with email scams will probably have guessed—the check is actually no good. But many law firms have fallen for the trick and wired the money before realizing that. Con artists make the elaborate stories very believable, with authentic-looking insurance paperwork and contact information that leads back to other scammers, who vouch for the documents' legitimacy.  In hindsight it sounds like you're stupid if you got trapped, but while you're in it, it's very sophisticated,  says one personal-injury attorney who was targeted by a ring that allegedly drained $32 million from law firms.

Interrogators kept the unidentified detainee awake by forcing him to stand with his arms chained above heart level, jerking on the chains if he nodded out, according to an internal CIA report released this week. The CIA kept the prisoner—most likely Mohammed Rahim al-Afghani, Osama bin Laden's translator and the only person known to be in CIA custody at that time—in diapers, allowing interrogators to keep him chained continuously without bathroom breaks. Officials noted in the documents that the sleepless prisoner remained  alert and oriented  and seemed to be  adhering to a well-developed, robust and capable resistance strategy.","Memos: CIA Kept Prisoner Awake, Chained for 6 Days","Memos: CIA Kept Prisoner Awake, Chained for ____ Days",6,Copy( 6 ),0

"(Feb 13, 2019  12:12 PM) Investigators have been unable to determine why the gunman who murdered two women at a Tallahassee yoga studio in November chose that locale, but they say his hatred of women was no secret. Scott Beierle, 40, wrote about that hatred as well as rape, torture, and murder, in his journals, and had a history of misconduct toward females dating back to grade school, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said Tuesday as the department released its final reports, per the Tallahassee Democrat. Beierle's online remarks were also troubling; the wife of a childhood friend notified the FBI about  violent lyrics about murder and stalking  on the amateur musician's website in August. DeLeo called the tip  non-actionable.  And yet, investigators working in the aftermath found Beierle had planned the Nov. 2 shooting for months. He called the studio and searched for a map of its building in August, per CNN. His 9mm handgun was bought in July, a month after Beierle was fired from a teaching job for inappropriately touching a female student. He was fired from another teaching job in 2015 for watching porn, and arrested twice in 2012 for groping women at Florida State University, per the Orlando Sentinel.  Although there was no specific target at the yoga studio …. [his] lifetime of misogynistic attitudes caused him to attack a familiar community,  DeLeo said. Beierle arrived early for the 5:30pm class. Inside the room, he put on earmuffs and pulled out a handgun, fatally shooting FSU student Maura Binkley, 21, and faculty member Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, in the back. Beierle wounded five others, and ultimately shot himself after a confrontation with patron Joshua Quick. Noting he carried more than 100 rounds of ammunition, DeLeo concluded  this could have been even worse than it was.","3 Months Before Yoga Shooting, a 'Non-Actionable' Tip","____ Months Before Yoga Shooting, a 'Non-Actionable' Tip",3,"Subtract( 11 , 8 )",1
"(Dec 13, 2012  12:32 PM) Residents of what is now Poland figured out how to make cheese about 7,500 years ago, reports the BBC. Archeologists have determined that clay vessels unearthed near a river were used to separate curds from whey, a key step in the process. The finding is the earliest such proof of cheese-making, and it would have been a huge innovation in the late Neolothic period, explains the LA Times. For one thing, most adults were lactose-intolerant at the time, and turning milk into cheese would make it easier to digest and thus be an important source of food. (It probably had the consistency of modern cottage cheese.) The discovery also may have helped dairy farming take hold.

Until former King Albert II provides a saliva sample, however, Boël will be getting $5,600 a day anyway. A court in Brussels has ordered the 84-year-old retired monarch to pay Boël for each day he refuses to provide the court-ordered sample based on Boël's claim that Albert, then the prince of Liège, had a decades-long affair with her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, which resulted in her birth in the 1960s, reports the BBC. Rumors of an illegitimate child first surfaced in a 1999 unauthorized biography of Albert's wife, Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria, whom he married in 1956. Albert has denied that Boël is his daughter ever since she went public with the claim in 2005, 12 years after Albert ascended to the throne after the death of his brother, Baudouin. Albert abdicated in 2013, and his son, Philippe, in 2013, is now king. Albert had appealed a 2018 court order requiring him to get the DNA test, and that appeal was struck down as part of Thursday's ruling, per the Brussels Times and Reuters. A separate DNA test already has proven that the man who is Boël's legal father is not her biological father.

"(Apr 29, 2020  6:05 PM CDT) A new book from Simone de Beauvoir is going to reach readers 66 years after it was written—and 34 years after the feminist author's death. Publishers say The Inseparables tells the story of the writer's friendship with Elisabeth  Zaza  Lacoin, who died at 21 from viral encephalitis, the Guardian reports. It will be released in France later this year and publishers hope to have an English translation out in 2021. Publisher Vintage says the book, which de Beauvoir wrote in 1954, focuses on  the friendship between two young women struggling against conventional ideas of what a woman should be in early 20th-century Paris: chaste, devout, obedient and obliged from a young age to set aside her own interests and passion.  Literary agency 2 Seas says the novel was  too intimate  to be published in de Beauvoir's lifetime. In her 1963 memoir Force of Circumstance, de Beauvoir said she showed it to then-partner Jean-Paul Sartre and put it aside after his harsh assessment, the New York Times reports; she wrote that the book  had no inner necessity.  Simone Le Bon-de Beauvoir, the writer's adopted daughter, says she has wanted to publish the manuscript since she first read it.  When she wrote it, in 1954, she had already honed her craft as a writer,  Le Bon-de Beauvoir says.  She destroyed some works that she was unhappy with. She didn't destroy this one.

It operated for 15 seconds, failed, and eventually came to rest ... somewhere. The exact location was unknown, thanks to radio communications that were disabled, possibly thanks to a dust storm. But a team of amateur researchers may have found the lander, Scientific American reports.

Another photo of the same area on the Red Planet's surface, taken by the NASA orbiter in March, backs up the Russian team's case, but they'll continue studying the pictures to confirm the finding. It's the first visible evidence of the lander in 41 years, Discovery News reports. The team of researchers was  crowdsourced  on the Internet in a campaign organized by Russian space enthusiasts.

The company won the bid to build the Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) at a cost that could top $80 billion, reports the Los Angeles Times. Northrop will get more than $20 billion to develop the bomber—which will replace aging B-1s and B-52s—plus $564 million per plane with 80 to 100 currently planned, reports Popular Mechanics. However, the cost of the project could spike if Northrop's record is any indication: The Pentagon initially planned for 132 Northrop-built B-2s in the 1980s, but ended up with 21 when costs skyrocketed to $2 billion per unit. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter says the LRS-B will be the  backbone  of the Air Force with  initial operational capability  in 2025. It should be ready to fly by 2040. Because there's no way to know what might be necessary in a bomber in 2040, the LRS-B will be  adaptable,  says the Air Force's chief of staff.

Amy Fleming, 60, was arrested in Florida on Jan. 29 and is being extradited to Nevada to face a charge that she killed her son before setting out for the swap meet with the boy's stepfather, Lee Luster, on Aug. 2, 1986.  We believe they were at the swap meet as a diversion and [Francillon Pierre] was already deceased,  an investigator said at a Monday news conference, noting neighbors hadn't seen the boy for weeks prior to that event, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Eight months earlier, a babysitter had found 30 to 40 welts on Francillon's neck and back, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Fleming and Luster, who moved to Florida in 1987, were found guilty of felony child abuse and sentenced to probation.  We definitely believe that child abuse could have played a factor in this homicide,  the investigator said.

"(Aug 27, 2015  10:07 AM CDT) It's a bird, it's a plane, it's ... a space butterfly? That's essentially what the Hubble Space Telescope has captured in a new image of the Twin Jet Nebula, a shimmering planetary nebula that strongly resembles a winged insect, reports CNET. What you're actually seeing in the image, released by the European Space Agency yesterday, is a two-winged nebula made of gas and dust, extending out from two stars, each similar in size to our sun.  The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf,  the ESA says in a release. Those ejected layers of gas expand outward in both directions as the stars slowly spin 2,000 light-years away, orbiting each other about once a century, reports Mashable. With its outer layers ejected into space, the aging star's exposed remnant core illuminates the waste, resulting in the colorful display. At the center of each wing, blue areas represent violent jets of gas gushing into space at approximately 621,000mph. Discovered in 1947 and officially known as PN M2-9, the Twin Jet Nebula gets its more common name from its shape.  If the nebula is sliced across the star, each side of it appears much like a pair of exhausts from jet engines,  says the ESA.

"(Aug 4, 2016  12:40 PM CDT) John Opdycke, writing in the Hill, knows what he wants to see out of  Bernie 2.0,  and it isn't for Sanders to become the Democratic Party's  official in-house radical.  Opdycke says Sanders needs to decide whether  this a 'what' revolution or a 'how' revolution  and whether he'll be  remaking  the Democratic Party or America itself.  There is little space within the current, highly partisan arrangement for new ideas and new programs,  Opdycke writes.  From both a moral and a pragmatic standpoint, the process issues are crucial when it comes to Bernie's next steps.  (Opdycke is the preesident of Open Primaries, a group dedicated to election reform. During his campaign Sanders switched from a  what  focus on progressive issues to a  how  focus, what Opdycke describes as a  call to action against a rigged political system.  Opdycke says Sanders needs to keep that up with his new grassroots organization, Our Revolution, by making sure  our  means all people, not just Democrats. He says Sanders needs to focus on the voting process and expanding democracy, even knowing it will upset the Democratic Party.  The country is ready for 'Our Revolution,'  Opdycke says.  But it must be ours. It cannot belong to a party or an ideology. It cannot be exclusionary or narrow. It must bridge the partisan divide, not add to it.

Witnesses say the child suicide bombers—four girls and one boy—were between the ages of 9 and 15. Three of the bombs exploded at a mosque just before final evening prayers. The girl with the fourth bomb intended for the mosque ran off but died when her bomb also exploded. The fifth child suicide bomber struck the house of a vigilante leader, who was not home at the time. The BBC reports Boko Haram is believed to be behind the attacks Thursday in Maiduguri, which was the Islamist militant group's original base six years ago. Boko Haram is stepping up attacks against civilians as the Nigerian military has begun seeing success in fighting them, according to Al Jazeera. A wave of attacks in Maiduguri less than two weeks ago killed at least 117 people. Earlier this week, Amnesty International called for greater protection for citizens from Boko Haram attacks.

I'm committing $10 billion to start,  he wrote, saying he wants to work with scientists, nonprofits and activists to fight the effects of climate change. Grants will be awarded starting this summer, Bezos wrote. The fund will not invest in private-sector efforts but will instead focus on charitable giving, the Verge reports. There's been no word on how to apply for the grants. A spokesman would not say exactly where the $10 billion to start the Earth Fund is coming from, though Bezos recently sold $4 billion in Amazon stock. Bezos' wealth is pegged at $130 billion. Bezos has felt heat from inside his company and out over the impact Amazon has on the planet, Financial Times points out. Last year, hundreds of employees signed a letter critical of Amazon's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. The company lags behind Microsoft by a decade in its schedule to become carbon negative—Microsoft's target is 2030. Bezos announced a Green Plan in September, just ahead of a global climate strike joined by Amazon employees.

Soules told the dispatcher that he  rear-ended a guy on a tractor  with his pickup truck Monday night on a road near the northern Iowa town of Aurora, according to a recording of the call released Wednesday. Soules, who appeared on the hit ABC reality show two years ago, said the man had been thrown into a ditch, wasn't conscious, and didn't appear to be breathing. He told the dispatcher that he didn't know CPR, and he could be heard asking others who were there if they did. The audio then indicates that someone tried to perform CPR on the man, but it's unclear whether it was Soules. Soules said the man had a pulse and had blood coming from his mouth. The six-minute call ends when Soules asks whether he can call back and hangs up. The tractor driver, a 66-year-old local farmer named Kenneth Mosher, was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities say Soules left the scene in another truck—it's unclear who was driving—before emergency responders arrived. He was arrested about five hours later at his farm in nearby Arlington; Assistant Buchanan County Attorney Jenalee Zaputil said Soules refused to leave his home and it took hours for police to get a search warrant to go inside and arrest him. He was booked on a charge of leaving the scene of a deadly crash and released on bond hours later. Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram said investigators are trying to determine whether alcohol or speed were factors in the crash.

National Weather Service meteorologist Ken Graham says that number includes the one that slammed into a trailer park in Convent, Louisiana, and one that killed a person near Purvis, Mississippi. Graham says teams will be sent out in the morning to document the damage and rate the tornadoes. Sheriff Willy Martin says at least two people were killed when the twister hit the park in Convent. He says authorities are using dogs to search piles of rubble left in the wake of the storm to find anyone else still missing under the debris. Martin says at least 30 people were wounded. Of those, seven are in critical condition. Vann Byrd of Mississippi's Lamar County Emergency Management Agency says the death in Purvis occurred in a mobile home west of the city. Byrd says officials are still sorting through reports of damage to some buildings. The storm system caused early school closures in districts in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama.

In an April court case only now being reported, the former couple were ordered to pay $660,000 plus $70,000 in reputation-related damages after allegedly stopping payments to the designer overseeing a lighting update to their 17th-century property in Provence. Odile Soudant tells Liberation that Pitt sought her services in 2010 to ensure natural light flooded the 40-room Chateau Miraval, where Pitt and Jolie got married, per the Guardian. Soudant says she employed 17 people who worked on the project for months. But Soudant adds she was nearly driven to ruin when Pitt stopped paying. Lawyers claimed Pitt stopped paying Soudant because he believed she had demanded nearly $6 million. But a French appeals court determined the amount had been overstated. Soudant says Pitt in an email demanded she  finish the project and be proud of it.  Another email reportedly read,  Don't waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don't worry about the rest.  Despite the April payout, Soudant says she's still fighting to get credit for the remodel, later taken over by another designer.

A group of eight people was skiing in the south part of the mountain range near Cornucopia when the avalanche hit; the other four were unhurt, the Oregonian reports. Oregon and Washington have seen heavy snowfall over the past week, and experts say the snow has been dense—and has fallen onto lighter snow, making it more likely to slide. Avalanche warnings are in effect for parts of the Washington Cascades and the Mount Hood area. The group was on the third day of a guided backcountry outing meant to last five days, and was comprised of two guides and six skiers, the AP reports. The owner of the company that organized the trip says they were all  fit, proficient downhill skiers  and that the avalanche  caught them by surprise  from above.

A CT scan revealed nothing but cerebrospinal fluid where the  little brain,  which contains around half the brain's neurons, was supposed to be, reports the New Scientist. The woman had sought medical help after experiencing a month of vomiting; she also noted she has always walked unsteadily. She has slightly slurred speech, and her mother told doctors she hadn't started walking until age 7 or speaking intelligibly until around age 6. The woman, who is married with a daughter, has no history of neurological problems in her family, researchers write in the journal Brain. Only eight other people have ever been found to have the condition, known as cerebellar agenesis, but most other cases involved infants with severe mental impairment and were discovered upon autopsy, the researchers say. This case  shows that the young brain tends to be much more flexible or adaptable to abnormalities,  a professor of neurosurgery at New York's North Shore University Hospital tells LiveScience, which notes that even a damaged cerebellum can cause severe motor challenges.  When a person is born with an abnormality ... the rest of the brain tries to reconnect and to compensate for that loss or absence.

Instead, a new skyscraper in Benidorm, Spain, is more likely to be the  laughingstock of the modern world,  suggests International Design Times. That's because the 47-story structure, due to open in December, lacks a working elevator. Or more precisely, it has one for the first 20 floors, reports the Daily Mail, but after that, residents will have to hoof it because of a rather massive design oversight: The elevator shaft is too narrow to accommodate the machinery for a bigger one. The InTempo project has been an absolute mess from the start, beset with bad loans, missed deadlines, deadly construction accidents, and bankrupt builders, reports El Pais, which gets into the details.

The Fort Worth, Texas company said today that it was also having discussions to sell all of its remaining assets. RadioShack Corp. introduced one of the first mass-market personal computers and used to be the go-to stop for consumers' home electronics needs. But it struggled as shoppers increasingly shifted to making purchases online and growth in its wireless business slowed. It has suffered years of losses.

RadioShack had warned of a possible bankruptcy in September, but received rescue financing that kept it afloat. Still, its CEO recently cautioned the chain might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay in business. RadioShack worked hard on its turnaround efforts, hiring Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca as its CEO and former Treasury Department adviser Harry Wilson as chief revitalization officer.

I know they suffered, and that's the part that, to this day, I still get sad about,  one owner, whose dog Buddy died, tells CTV News. Paulsen now faces six  charges under pretty much every single possible section of animal cruelty that could have been in this particular case,  an SPCA official tells the Global News, including two counts of causing an animal to continue to be in distress—which has never been charged in British Columbia. She could face jail time and stiff penalties; the distress charges carry a $75,000 fine each.",Dog Walker Hit With Charges After 6 Dogs Die in Hot Car,Dog Walker Hit With Charges After ____ Dogs Die in Hot Car,6,Trans( six ),1

Pictures of the climb made the rounds this week and got quite a bit of attention, the AP reports, and now the local government is planning to install a set of stairs. Currently, the ladder system is the only way to access the village; officials say the stairs will be a temporary fix while a more permanent solution is pondered. The Guardian describes the ladders as  rickety  and says the children must also  claw their way over bare rocks  during the trek, which takes 90 minutes. The Beijing News photographer who took the pictures now getting attention says he was  shocked by the scene I saw in front of me  and wanted to bring attention to the village's  painful reality.  The journey to the village is  very dangerous,  he tells the Guardian.  You have to be 100% careful. If you have any kind of accident, you will fall straight into the abyss.  Another reporter was later said to have started crying when she realized there was no other way to reach the village, and the village chief says several villagers have fallen to their deaths.","To Get Home From School, 15 Kids Make This Terrifying Climb","To Get Home From School, ____ Kids Make This Terrifying Climb",15,Copy( 15 ),0

CNN reports that thieves swiped an acre's worth of apples from Williams Orchard in LaPorte County, Ind., last week, which translates to a whopping 50,000 apples and about $27,000 out of owners Jon and Robin Drummond's pockets.  Almost every single apple from every single tree was completely wiped out,  says Jon Drummond. The Drummonds had recently bought the orchard, and built new gates, but hadn't gotten around to installing locks; the thieves were able to drive right in to a secluded part of the orchard, harvest away, and drive out.  It probably was an insider job,  says Jon Drummond.  Someone knew this orchard really well. They knew where to go, the portion of the orchard where they couldn't be seen.  The Drummonds don't have theft insurance, and suspect the thieves are busily making cider.

"(Jan 12, 2013  4:54 PM) More than 1,000 Catholic priests have written a frantic letter arguing that same-sex marriage laws in Britain would  severely  limit their freedom to promote and practice their faith, the Daily Telegraph reports.  After centuries of persecution, Catholics have, in recent times, been able to be members of the professions and participate fully in the life of this country,  they write. But if enacted, same-sex marriage will restrict  the ability of Catholics to teach the truth about marriage in their schools, charitable institutions or places of worship.  The letter was signed by 1,054 priests and 13 other senior Catholic figures—nearly a quarter of Catholic priests in England and Wales—as the debate over gay marriage heats up in Britain. The letter even compares Prime Minister David Cameron to Henry VIII, who broke with the Catholic Church in order to divorce Katherine of Aragon in the 1500s. Henry VIII wanted to  redefine what was marriage,  they write, which launched an upheaval in England and made life  very difficult  for Catholics. But British officials maintain that freedom of speech will be respected in schools, and one blogger has already returned fire:  Gee, we thought that marriage was a millennia-old institution that gays are only now trying to change,  writes Dan Avery at Queerty.

It seemed on a mission to prove that a new era has come to Studio 8H—one with a markedly different tone,  writes Esther Zuckerman at Entertainment Weekly.  There was little about the show that was familiar. It seemed intent on showing off the new generation.  But for all assumptions  that the show's premiere would reflect these growing pains,  writes Ryan Gajewski at the Hollywood Reporter, the show  was sharp and consistently funny, thanks in no small part to host Chris Pratt.  Pratt sang in his opening monologue to his wife, who appeared in the audience, adds Brian Anthony Hernandez at Mashable, noting that  Her name is Anna Faris; she's hosted twice. We had sex and a baby popped out. It's true. Do you remember that?  Zuckerman notes that  it was incredibly strange not to hear Don Pardo's voice booming across the opening credits,  but that  I’m sure we’ll get used to Darrell Hammond’s take eventually.  Perhaps less consequentially, over at Huffington Post, Lauren Duca notes that musical guest Ariana Grande was again wearing cat ears, which means that  Ariana Grande wearing cat ears is just another thing we have to accept now, much like Ariana Grande wearing her hair in a high ponytail and the impermanent nature of human existence.

Grasso was ousted in 2003 after details of his pay package surfaced, sparking a nasty confrontation between Spitzer and Grasso, as well as the NYSE directors who approved the deal. The state had argued that Grasso’s compensation was unreasonably high under New York regulations governing a not-for-profit company. But the court ruled that the state lost its right to sue when the NYSE became a for-profit company in 2006.  I’ve always had confidence in the system,  Grasso said.

"(Apr 3, 2019  8:20 AM CDT) As the Trump administration continues to try to dismantle ObamaCare, with a GOP plan now not expected until after the 2020 election, some sobering statistics have emerged underscoring the necessity for affordable health care. Per the New York Times, a survey released Tuesday by Gallup and the West Health nonprofit shows about 25% of respondents have held off on medical treatment because of the cost, while 45% are afraid they'll go bankrupt in the event of a  major health event,  per a release. Another big number from the survey, which polled 3,500 US adults by phone in early 2019: the $88 billion Americans have borrowed over the past year to pay for health care.  Our data shows an American public that's beaten down from this really serious issue,  a Gallup researcher tells the Times. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they're  completely  or  mostly  satisfied with the current health-care system based on their own experiences, though that number plunges to 39% when asked how well the system takes care of Americans in general. There's also a schism between Republicans and Democrats, with 67% of self-identified GOPers saying the US system is the best or one of the best in the world, while only 38% of Democrats say the same. However,  there is very little that separates the groups when it comes to the real-life consequences of the high cost of health care on their everyday lives,  Tim Lash, West Health's chief strategy officer, says in the release.

That figure—which is significantly more pessimistic than the Congressional Budget Office’s $1.48 trillion estimate—comes alongside Obama’s newly released $3.73 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2012, which the administration says would shave $1.1 trillion off the deficit over the next decade. Under Obama’s plan, the deficit would shrink to $1.1 trillion in 2012, and to around $600 billion a year thereafter through 2018.

Bond would go on to see his creation enchant children for more than half a century and become an icon immortalized in print, on screens, and as countless stuffed toys before his death at age 91. His publisher, HarperCollins, said Wednesday that the author died at his home a day earlier after a short illness, the AP reports. HarperCollins exec Ann-Janine Murtagh said Bond  will be forever remembered for his creation of the iconic Paddington ... which touched my own heart as a child and will live on in the hearts of future generations.

Born in England in 1926, Bond served in both the Royal Air Force and the British Army during World War II. He began writing while stationed with the army in Egypt in 1945.

"(Jul 12, 2016  1:50 PM CDT) Researchers are pushing for banner ads that offer free HIV test kits to gay men on the dating and hookup site Grindr after a UCLA and Indiana University study. Results from the study, reported in the journal Sexual Health, suggest that greater access to free testing will improve rates of testing. The team says that after posting 300,000 banners ads and three broadcast messages targeting a high-risk HIV population in Los Angeles in the fall of 2014, 333 tests were requested, 56 men took them and filled out questionnaires, and two men ultimately learned that they were HIV positive. Engadget notes that given 5 million men in 192 countries use Grindr, the simple step could be a  very effective  means of slowing the spread of HIV. Paper author Dr. Jeffrey D. Klausner, an HIV specialist at UCLA's school of medicine, tells the New York Times that using the app to encourage home testing is  ripe for expansion  in other cities and possibly countries. He says they used Grindr because it's the  oldest and biggest  gay dating app, and they focused on black and Hispanic men who have sex with men because they are four times more likely than their white counterparts to not know they are HIV positive. Recipients received test kits in the mail, via a pharmacy voucher, or via a code that produced a vending machine kit at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. The test relies on a simple swab of the gums and results are available in 20 minutes. (The CDC predicts that one in two gay black men alive today will become HIV positive in their lifetime.)","Because of Grindr, 2 Men Learn They Have HIV","Because of Grindr, ____ Men Learn They Have HIV",2,Trans( two ),1

Some 33% said same-sex couples should not be legally recognized at all. The results are more striking when broken down by age, notes CBS: Though the percentage of those 18 to 44 who oppose legal recognition is about the same as the overall average, a full 53% in that age group support gay marriage.

"(Feb 24, 2014  9:46 AM) When scientists claimed more than a decade ago that tiny crystals in Australia were 4.4 billion years old, they faced skepticism. The Earth itself, after all, is 4.5 billion years old, the Sydney Morning Herald notes.  Nothing in science goes without being questioned,  geochemist John Valley tells NPR. Now, however, his team has proven the crystals' age is correct—in other words, they're the oldest Earth-formed materials ever found. Researchers dated the crystals, which need magnification to be seen, by investigating how much of the uranium within them had turned into lead. But that standard dating method wasn't enough to convince some fellow scientists. Doubters pointed out that as time went by, lead atoms could have shifted around inside the crystal, potentially resulting in inaccurate readings. So the experts turned to a process called atom-probe tomography, which allowed them to map out specific atoms, NPR reports. The study showed that, in fact, the atoms hadn't moved much. Now,  we've proved that the chemical record inside these zircons is trustworthy,  Valley tells LiveScience. The findings indicate that the Earth may have been able to host life earlier than had been believed:  there is no reason why life could not have existed on Earth 4.3 billion years ago,  Valley says.",Earth's Oldest Rocks: 4.4B-Year-Old Crystals,Earth's Oldest Rocks: ____B-Year-Old Crystals,4.4,Copy( 4.4 ),0

"(Nov 25, 2020  11:28 AM) The parents of Seth Rich have reached a settlement with Fox News, which put forth the conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee staffer killed in what police said was a robbery gone wrong in 2016 was instead murdered after leaking Democratic emails to WikiLeaks. A recent Yahoo investigation found the story had been pushed by Russia, apparently to distract from its own role in leaking the emails. Fox's 2017 story was mentioned widely across the network before it was retracted a week later for failing to meet a  high degree of editorial scrutiny.  Still, the conspiracy theory continued to spread. Joel and Mary Rich of Omaha, Neb., subsequently sued the network for emotional distress, arguing Fox had  intentionally exploited  their son's murder for political reasons, per the Washington Post.

The company has met its financial goals, Mashable reports, which makes Musk eligible for his reward. He can now buy 1.69 million shares at $350.02 apiece. At Thursday's closing price of $805 or so, the CEO's payout comes to about $770 million. Under his compensation plan, announced in January 2018, Musk has to hold onto the shares for five years. The company goals included a market cap averaging more than $100 billion for six months, and either annual revenue of $20 billion or adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion. In an SEC filing in advance of a shareholder meeting, the company confirmed that the goals were met and Musk can collect. And that's just the beginning. There are 11 more tranches ahead, should Tesla meet the connected goals. The program faces a challenge, however, per CNBC. A shareholder has sued Musk and board members over the plan, saying the board violated its fiduciary duty by approving excessive compensation for the CEO.

"(Nov 1, 2013  6:24 AM CDT) Baby boy or baby girl? As of today, parents in Germany have the option of choosing neither, leaving the gender spot on their newborn's birth certificate blank if the baby's sex can't be determined. As many as one in 2,000 people are born with ambiguous genitalia, and the new law basically creates a third gender category for  indeterminate  or  intersex  people, the BBC reports. Currently, passport holders in the country are listed as either M (male) or F (female); with this change, a third option will be added: X (intersex). Individuals whose gender is left blank at birth can choose later to become male or female, or can remain intersex, Der Spiegel reports. Germany, the first European country to make such an allowance, reviewed cases of intersex babies and found that many who were subjected to sex assignment surgery at a young age ended up unhappy. The law is an attempt to relax the pressure on parents, who may feel forced to make a quick decision about gender and surgery. But the Wall Street Journal explains the law's wording could actually have the unplanned effect of pushing parents toward surgery. It reads that if a male or female gender can't be assigned, the child  shall be entered without such information in the register of births.  Some fear that might lead stigma-wary parents to request surgery that would allow for a definitive determination of sex.

Investigators found the man—whose identity NBC agreed to keep anonymous—in possession of two dozen photos and videos of girls as young as 3 being sexually abused by adult men. But instead of giving the man, who pleaded guilty, years in prison, Judge Jack Weinstein ignored sentencing guidelines, which he argues are too harsh on people convicted of possessing child pornography. In his decision, he claims taking the man—a father of five—away from his children would be  depriving them of a loving father and role model.  The 94-year-old judge argues sentencing guidelines for child pornography don't balance the  need to protect the public  against the  need to avoid excessive punishment,  NBC reports. He points out the man didn't abuse children himself and that the Internet makes child pornography easily available to all Americans. The man has claimed he wasn't looking for child pornography, it just  kept popping up  when he was trying to download regular porn. Others are  appalled  by Weinstein's decision, arguing that anyone who even looks at child pornography is perpetuating the abuse of children.

It's $15 million more than he was asking. According to Ars Technica, which points out punitive damages could still be added to the total, the loss in court could be a  life-threatening event  for Gawker, which has around 250 employees. Gawker published a video of Hogan having sex with the wife of his friend Todd Clem—aka Bubba the Love Sponge—made at Clem's insistence. Clem had recorded the encounter, possibly without Hogan's knowledge. Hogan cried when the jury revealed its findings after nearly six hours of deliberations, CNN reports. In their closing arguments Friday, Hogan's lawyers argued the video was a violation of his privacy.  Gawker took a secretly recorded sex tape and put it on the Internet,  the AP quotes Hogan's attorneys.

But that's exactly what transpired at a Saturday reception outside Buffalo, NY, according to an unidentified worker at the Orchard Park Country Club. The Buffalo News reports that seven police agencies were called to the scene after a massive fight broke out just after 11pm, as the reception ended and guests were readying to go home.  Things were said that can never be taken back,  says one witness; the paper reports that family members were yelling of their hatred for each other. The worker says about 200 people attended the reception, and WIVB reports that an arriving officer saw at least 100 people fighting. The bride and groom reportedly weren't among them: She was taken to a back patio, while her new husband stayed inside and attempted to get his guests to exit. One man received stitches for a head injury, and a few others were treated on the scene. No arrests were made, and while the State Liquor Authority has opened an investigation into what transpired, police tell the News that criminal charges are unlikely. As for what caused the fracas, the police chief doesn't seem to know:  It could be someone was touched inappropriately. It could be a family issue. It could be an emotional issue.  And someone actually was touched inappropriately, allegedly by a member of the wedding party who was then punched; police were previously called at 10:18pm to deal with that.

According to a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling last week, Pellow's boyfriend, Khek Chanthalavong, was using a blowtorch to burn fur off a squirrel he planned to eat when he left the blowtorch unattended on Pellow's wooden deck for 15 minutes in October 2012, reports WZZM. He returned to find a fire that ripped through Pellow's apartment building in Holland Township, damaging 32 units and destroying dozens of residents' personal effects. A court initially ordered Pellow to pay $15,400 in damages. However, justices ruled last Wednesday that she may have to pay up to $2 million to cover costs paid by an insurance company, per WWMT. While the, um, barbeque was banned under Pellow's rental agreement, she argued the contract was  never explained to her.  The justices countered that landlords aren't required to  read and explain  rental agreements to tenants and found Pellow liable for the  fur-burning escapade,  even though Chanthalavong was the one doing the cooking.

How did he do it? Mahjoobi, now 31 and working in fashion, has no idea, and tells the Telegraph he had never before heard of the bizarre 2008 deal that happened under his name. At the time, he was working at his part-time job at Galaxy Aviation Trade Company, which had connections to Iran. He suspects another company, Intelligent Aviation Services, was set up in his name specifically to push through the deal. WikiLeaks documents reveal the international investigation that centered around the unwitting Brit: US sanctions make it nearly impossible for Tehran’s national carrier to openly purchase passenger planes, and the US had blocked Galaxy from buying the plane in question. Days later, Intelligent was set up, listing Mahjoobi as the only director, but using an address linked to a Galaxy director. Within weeks, the plane was purchased from a Turkish airline and had arrived in Iran, where it is still an important part of IranAir’s fleet.

The researchers wanted to study the effects of topical hyaluronic acid on corneal ulcers; under sedation, the dogs' left corneas were wounded (the New York Daily News reports this blinded them in that eye), with half the group then acting as control and half administered the acid. Per the study, posted by the Journal of Veterinary Opthamology,  No statistical differences ... were found between groups at any tested time point.  At its conclusion, the dogs were put down.

Beagle Freedom Project lawyer Dan Kolde tells the Riverfront Times the researchers acknowledged in the study itself that 12 dogs were needed per group to  detect a clinically significant difference in healing rates.  But using 24 dogs for the pilot study wasn't feasible so they went ahead with six. Had the acid worked, the study would have been written off due to population size, the Beagle Freedom Project maintains. At its completion, the animals were killed and their eyes removed and filed; the dog advocates say the animals should have been turned over for adoption.

Turns out it wasn't, the ex-manager of a Mavis Discount Tire now claims, adding a new twist to the story, USA Today and the Times Union report. In a letter filed in court this week by Schoharie County DA Susan Mallery, Virgil Park—who used to run the shop where the 2001 stretch Ford Excursion owned by Prestige Limousine was taken for service—told the DA's office last month a worker at his shop later told him the brake part was never installed; Park adds the part was returned to the vendor 8 days later.

"(Jun 5, 2020  1:28 PM CDT) Research already has suggested that men face a greater risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Now, scientists say male pattern baldness might actually be a risk factor, reports the Telegraph.  We really think that baldness is a perfect predictor of severity,  says Brown University's Carlos Wambier, lead author of two small studies in Spain. The first study of 41 men admitted to Spanish hospitals with COVID-19 found 71% had male pattern baldness, which is estimated to affect 31% to 53% of white men. The second study of 122 men admitted to three Madrid hospitals with COVID-19 found 79% had male pattern baldness, reports Science. As male pattern baldness is linked to dihydrotestosterone—an androgen, or so-called  male  sex hormone—the thought is that androgens may boost the virus' ability to penetrate cells. There is other evidence in support of this theory. For instance, a study of 42,000 men with prostate cancer in Veneto, Italy, found patients on androgen-deprivation therapy—drugs that reduce levels of androgens that fuel prostate cancer cells—were significantly less likely to fall ill, be hospitalized, or die of COVID-19 than men with prostate cancer who were not taking the drugs. These results are replicated in a second, still-unpublished study, whose author believes  androgen deprivation may limit those severe outcomes,  per Science. A US trial is already underway to see if drugs that treat male pattern baldness (by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone) are effective at treating COVID-19. Another study of 200 veterans in Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York will analyze the effect of prostate cancer drugs, per the Telegraph.",New Risk Factor for COVID-19: Baldness?,New Risk Factor for COVID-____: Baldness?,19,Copy( 19 ),0
"(Mar 10, 2016  12:12 PM) A 51-year-old woman was found guilty Thursday of kidnapping a newborn in 1997 as the girl's mother slept in a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The unnamed defendant had pleaded not guilty, insisting she adopted the infant and  didn't know the baby was stolen.  Incredibly, the girl was reunited with her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse, last year after befriending a girl at school who resembled her—and who ended up being her younger sister. The Nurses cried as the verdict was read; the defendant had also cried in court while testifying about being barred from seeing the girl she'd raised as her daughter. She testified that she had miscarried a baby in 1996 without telling her husband, then paid a woman to find her an infant to adopt, and that when the woman did so, the defendant told her husband the baby was theirs. The judge rejected that story as  a fairytale,  the Guardian reports, adding,  You must have been the person who removed the child from [the] hospital.  She was convicted of kidnapping, fraud (she registered the child as her own daughter in 2003 and changed her birthdate), and contravening child protection laws; the judge said she faces 10 years in prison when she's sentenced on May 30.

"(Apr 29, 2013  5:27 PM CDT) Jessica Heeringa was working the night shift at a Michigan gas station when she went missing just before the 11pm closing time Friday night, the AP reports. Investigators think the petite 25-year-old mother was abducted, and family members believe she was lured away from the Exxon Mobil in Norton Shores by an acquaintance or someone saying they needed help. A few odd details from the local police chief would seem to fit that theory:  There's no sign of a struggle, no sign of anything inside the store being disturbed. The cash drawer was sitting out and no money was missing. Her purse was in the store with 400-some dollars in it. It's just odd how that occurred.  Friends say customers at the gas station are regular, and they also believe Heeringa knew or at least recognized her abductor, Fox 17 reports. Heeringa's disappearance was discovered after customers found the gas station open but empty and called police. There's scant evidence to work with, as the station had no security camera; right now, police are looking for a gray or silver minivan seen in the area and its driver, a white man aged 30 to 40, around six feet tall with wavy, light brown hair. Friends and family members are upset with the owner of the gas station, who they say is not doing enough to help, Michigan Live reports. Heeringa's fiance (the father of her 3-year-old son) and a few other acquaintances have already been cleared, WZZM reports.","Gas Station Employee, 25, Likely Abducted: Police","Gas Station Employee, ____, Likely Abducted: Police",25,Copy( 25 ),0
"(Jan 18, 2012  8:09 AM) Brutality and stupidity isn't a charming combination, but it certainly makes things easier for the police. Seven Chicago teens are being charged over a YouTube video that shows a group of teens beating a 17-year-old in an alley, reports the Chicago Tribune. The teen is kicked, punched, and taunted for several minutes before he manages to escape. Police say the victim was robbed of $180 and his shoes—which the gang beat him with. One 17-year-old boy is being charged as an adult; the remaining five boys and a girl, ages 15 and 16, are being treated as minors. The attackers call the victim—who appears to be of Asian descent—the N-word dozens of times, but police say the beating was not racially motivated. Analysts note that it is becoming increasingly common for youths to share videos of clearly criminal behavior.  Today our young people are experiencing this idea that unless their behavior is shared with the rest of the group, it doesn't really count as something that happened,  a communications professor says.",7 Chicago Teens Charged in Beating Video on YouTube,____ Chicago Teens Charged in Beating Video on YouTube,7,Trans( Seven ),1

"(Apr 29, 2015  12:00 PM CDT) Jean Nidetch, a New York housewife who tackled her own obesity problem, then shared her guiding principles with others in meetings that became known as Weight Watchers, died today at her home in Parkland, Florida, at age 91. Plagued by a weight problem since childhood, Nidetch had tried all manner of fad diets, pills, and treatments in failed efforts to slim down before, at 214 pounds, she began picking up tips at an obesity clinic sponsored by the New York City Board of Health in 1961. No skipping meals. Fish five times a week. Two pieces of bread and two glasses of skim milk a day. More fruits and vegetables. But Nidetch disliked the way the clinic's leader imparted information and how little the group's members shared, so she gathered six overweight friends in her Queens living room to share what she'd learned and talk about their own food compulsions. Nidetch reached her goal weight of 142 pounds in 1962 and in 1963, the weekly meetings at her home developed into Weight Watchers International. By the following year, classes were being held across New York, with dozens of participants going on to lead sessions of their own. Franchises were opened, a cookbook sold millions, and by 1968, the company went public with adherents across the globe. Nidetch traveled the world preaching Weight Watchers' simple gospel and became a millionaire along the way, selling the company to H.J. Heinz Co. for about $71 million in 1978. Though her 2009 autobiography stated, simply,  I'm not a millionaire anymore,  her greatest legacy, she always said, was the millions of men and women who lost weight using her plan. To the end, she was unwavering in her message and still received rock-star treatment when she attended Weight Watchers functions, prompting standing ovations, the flash of cameras, and requests for autographs.",Weight Watchers Founder Dead at 91,Weight Watchers Founder Dead at ____,91,Copy( 91 ),0

It also has plenty of cases like Timothy Lee's, the now 53-year-old who got busted for stealing that jacket in 1996, reports the Guardian. Another lifer got put away for siphoning gas. The US is  virtually alone in its willingness to sentence non-violent offenders to die behind bars,  says report author Jennifer Turner. The ACLU wants life sentences abolished for these types of criminals because they are  grotesquely out of proportion to the conduct they seek to punish.

When it's all fake, that's news—and the story behind a new documentary called Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art, the CBC reports. Filmmaker Barry Avrich says he was inspired by a 2012 Vanity Fair article to sit down with Ann Freedman, the New York City art maven who sold more than 40 fake paintings over 20 years. But Freedman insists she's the victim of a quiet con artist who sold her the paintings. Avrich says he had to convince Freedman to be in the film:  She had to have a level of trust in me,  he explains.  What I basically said to her was that I will ensure that the film has balance, but ultimately, the audience is going to decide.  The con duped art experts and buyers at a time when industry profits were exploding—and Freedman, who banked 10% to 15% per sale, clearly saw dollar signs. But how much she knew is anyone's guess, and Avrich says his film crew wavered during 15 hours of interviews with her.  My bottom line on her: I don't believe she went in to deceive anybody, but she should’ve known, five or six paintings in, that this was a problem,  he says.  I think she's guilty of not stopping when red flags were coming up.  With buyers fuming, the case ended up in court and left the Knoedler Gallery—which Freedman directed—in tatters.

Now, with the death of a northern white rhino in a Czech zoo, there are just four of the animals left in a species already past the point of no return. Nabire, a 31-year-old female, died Monday in the same zoo where she was born; she was unable to produce offspring because she suffered from uterine cysts, one of which ended up killing her, Live Science reports.  The pathological cyst inside the body of Nabire was huge. There was no way to treat it,  said the zoo's rhino curator in a statement.  Her death is a symbol of the catastrophic decline of rhinos due to a senseless human greed,  the zoo's director said, per AFP.  Her species is on the very brink of extinction.  With the death of Nabire, the only remaining northern white rhinos are three females who are unable to breed—an elderly female at the San Diego Zoo and two in Kenya—and the last surviving male, who's also at the Kenyan conservancy, where a last-ditch breeding effort to save the species failed, the AP reports. In a Facebook post, the San Diego Zoo offered its condolences to the Czech zoo and said that instead of giving up on the species, it's collecting genetic material so the rhino's genome can be preserved. The Czech zoo removed Nabire's healthy left ovary after her death, and the zoo's statement notes that the ultimate goal would be to generate northern white rhino embryos and transfer them into a closely related surrogate: the southern white rhino.

"(Nov 5, 2014  1:44 PM) The obvious big winner in last night's election is Mitch McConnell. But observers see two less-obvious victors in Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie. At Vox, for example, Ezra Klein writes that  a more Democratic year could have led to some new stars who might have been able to challenge  Clinton in 2016. The GOP wave took care of that. Andrew Romano at Yahoo goes further, arguing that  almost everything  about the results— the map, the math and the legislative morass that lies ahead in the run-up to 2016—suggests that the former first lady and secretary of state will have a better next two years than the party currently guzzling champagne.  One of Romano's points is that in 2016, the Senate races up for grabs look more favorable to Democrats, which should give her an electoral boost. As for Christie, as head of the Republican Governors' Association, he can take a big share of the credit for GOP gubernatorial candidates' great success last night.  He can now argue not only that he has personally won elections in a blue state but that he led a bunch of other Republicans to win hard elections in blue states,  writes Klein.  That's going to be a powerful argument to make to Republicans in 2016.  One more observation on Clinton, via Jonathan Chait at New York: Given that the GOP now controls the House and Senate, he writes that she is now  the only thing standing between a Republican Party even more radical than George W.

"(Mar 17, 2016  1:23 PM CDT) The chief US district judge in Washington, DC, resigned abruptly on Wednesday, the same day a Utah woman filed a lawsuit accusing him of repeatedly raping her 35 years ago, NBC News reports. The lawsuit claims Richard Roberts was a civil rights lawyer in 1981 when he  intimidated, coerced, and manipulated  16-year-old Terry Mitchell into having sex almost daily for weeks, according to the Washington Post. At the time, Roberts was a prosecutor in the trial of Joseph Paul Franklin, a white supremacist serial killer who shot two black men while they were jogging with Mitchell and another woman. Mitchell was a witness in the trial. The lawsuit claims Roberts told Mitchell—vulnerable from her friends' deaths and past sexual assaults—that Franklin might not be convicted if she told anyone about their relationship, the AP reports. Roberts cites health concerns as his reason for stepping down as DC's chief US district judge—a position he was appointed to in 1998 by Bill Clinton—and his lawyers call Mitchell's claims  categorically false.  They say Roberts had a consensual relationship with Mitchell only after the trial was over, which they call  a bad lapse in judgment.  The Utah Attorney General's office investigated Mitchell's claims and decided not to pursue criminal charges against Roberts as the state's age of consent was 16 in 1981. The lawsuit states Mitchell repressed all memory of Roberts allegedly raping her until an email from him in 2013, after Franklin was executed. Roberts' lawyers say Roberts and Mitchell have stayed on good terms in the decades since the trial, exchanging calls and emails that have  always been warm, caring, and friendly,  making her claims  puzzling and disappointing.",DC Judge Quits After Witness Accuses Him of 1981 Rape,DC Judge Quits After Witness Accuses Him of ____ Rape,1981,Copy( 1981 ),0

Lucky the two-faced calf, who lives on a Campbellsville, Ky., farm, is the result of a rare genetic mutation that at first had owners Brandy and Stan McCubbin doing a double-take when she was born in mid-September.  From a distance, I thought I had twins lying together,  Stan told WDRB at the time.  Then when I saw her, I was just completely blown away.  The McCubbins' 5-year-old daughter named the calf after she heard her mom say the baby was lucky to alive. The BBC explains that two-headed animals like Lucky—a condition called craniofacial duplication, or diprosopus— can be produced in a variety of ways: They can come from a single fertilized egg that never fully separates, be the result of a developmental anomaly in which the head keeps growing until it breaks into two new ones, or emerge when cells that set off head development somehow get moved to the wrong part of an animal's body. Lucky's two middle eyes don't work, she can only walk in circles, and she tends to fall down a lot. She also needs assistance when chowing down—and both her mouths move when she's chewing—but she seems healthy otherwise.

He just had to go to Russia first to visit his sick mother. On Oct. 31, prosecutors got a fax from the US Embassy in Moscow: Svadjian was dead of pneumonia. In 2013, the statute of limitations having expired, the evidence against him was trashed. Except he wasn't dead. Viktoras Cajevkis (a Lithuanian) was stopped in a Kiev, Ukraine, airport in July.

She was 95. Holm had been hospitalized two weeks ago with dehydration after a fire in Robert De Niro's apartment in the same Manhattan building. She had asked her husband, Frank Basile, on Friday to bring her home, and spent her final days with relatives and close friends by her side, said her great-niece. In a career that spanned more than half a century, Holm played everyone from Ado Annie—the girl who just can't say no in Oklahoma!—to a worldly theatrical agent in the 1991 comedy I Hate Hamlet to guest star turns on TV shows such as Fantasy Island and Love Boat II to Bette Davis' best friend in All About Eve. She won the Academy Award in 1947 for best supporting actress for her performance in Gentlemen's Agreement and received Oscar nominations for Come to the Stable (1949) and All About Eve (1950). In her early 70s, an interviewer asked if she had ever thought of retiring.  What for?  she replied.  If people retired, we wouldn't have had Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud ...

Since the 1980s, outstanding home-equity loans—once called second mortgages—have exploded a thousandfold to more than $1 trillion. The New York Times looks at how banks waged a concerted advertising campaign to transform Americans' attitude toward debt, enriching themselves while leading homeowners to financial ruin. Banks across America made billions assuring customers that money was  hidden in your house.  Now, for the first time since World War II, Americans own less than half of the value of their homes—a shift observers attribute to changes in the culture of debt.  Calling it a ‘second mortgage,’ that’s like hocking your house,  said one Citicorp executive.

Crueler still, while the disorder is highly rare it's also genetic, and as the Washington Post reports, it's  not unusual  for the disease to affect more than one child in a family (here are two examples). In the case of Les and Celeste Chappell, four of their 10 children had the diagnosis, and three have now died—all in July, over the course of three days, in the family's home in Springville, Utah. As the Post reports, Elizabeth, 19, and James, 15—who had had the toughest time—were being tube-fed. When the time came for Les and Celeste to do the same for Christopher, 20, they reflected on the experience of their other two children and decided not to—and they felt that choice should extend to Elizabeth and James. So on July 13, the feeding tubes were removed, medication was given to ease any pain, and the family begin to pray over a process they were warned could take weeks. Instead, Elizabeth died the next day, followed by James the next and Christopher the next. The three shared an obituary and an eternal resting place: The parents purchased three burial plots, each designed to hold two coffins. Les and Celeste will one day share one. Christopher and Elizabeth now share another. In the third, James rests, with a space above that brother Samuel, 10, will one day occupy.

It's a great story, a classic case of government abuse—and almost certainly not true, writes Kevin Drum at Mother Jones. Yes, the invoices show the department spent $4,200 on 250 muffins and similarly egregious amounts for cookies.  So did DOJ really pay $16 for muffins?  asks Drum.  Of course not.  The problem is that the auditors accepted hotel invoices as gospel—and they never are. His theory: Someone at DOJ gave the hotel a budget. The hotel then divvied up charges into a handful of categories, instead of invoicing every piece of food served.  I'm here to tell you that this happens All. The. Time,  writes Drum.  I've been involved in what feels like a thousand conferences of this kind, and I'd be shocked if it happened any other way.

"(Nov 24, 2015  11:36 AM) A newly approved drug is being hailed as a major advance in treatment of cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic disease that clogs the lungs with mucus and makes patients struggle to breathe. But it comes with a punishing price tag—about $710 per patient per day. Orkambi—taken as two pills, twice daily—is a combination of two cystic fibrosis drugs that won approval from the FDA in July. Federal law requires Medicaid to cover FDA-approved drugs, and the US government picks up more than half the tab. The treatment takes a bite out of Medicaid programs already facing big budget problems, and a small state like Vermont will be on the hook next year for $3.6 million—nearly 7% of the state's estimated $54 million Medicaid budget deficit—for a drug expected to treat only 40 people. Orkambi's arrival follows on the heels of last year's new hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, which claimed the record for the most expensive drug purchase by Vermont Medicaid. About 70 Medicaid patients received it in Vermont last fiscal year, leaving the state with a bill of nearly $5.9 million, says a Department of Vermont Health Access rep.  States that have small budgets in their Medicaid also can't afford ... to pay for 40 people in their state when they've got many others who need diabetes drugs and whatever other drugs,  says a drug pricing expert.  So yes there is a breaking point. As more and more expensive drugs come out, we're reaching that breaking point.

Jayme has been found alive almost three months after her parents were found dead in their home, the Barron County Sheriff's Department announced in a Facebook post late Thursday. The sheriff's department says a suspect is in custody and more details will be disclosed in a press conference Friday morning. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that the  bedraggled and malnourished  girl fled her captor and sought help from neighbors in an area of cabins east of Gordon, a town around 65 miles north of her home in Barron. She disappeared on Oct. 15. Teacher Kristin Kasinkas says a neighbor who had been walking a dog knocked on their door frantically around 4pm Thursday, accompanied by a girl, and said:  This is Jayme Closs! Call 911.  The dog walker tells the Star Tribune that Jayme came up to her and said she wanted help. Relatives say Jayme, whose parents were shot to death, is now recuperating in the hospital.

"(Aug 4, 2018  11:00 AM CDT) Hate airport security lineups? The Transportation Security Administration is offering to eliminate screenings entirely at small and medium-sized airports in a new cost-saving effort, CNN reports. An internal TSA document outlines the proposed $300 million budget slash, including fewer federal air marshals ($39 million), cuts at TSA headquarters ($26 million), fewer K-9 reimbursements to law enforcement (over $20 million), and less spent on part-time benefits ($18.5 million). But the removal of screenings at more than 150 airports with flights carrying 60 passengers or less—with savings of $115 million—is getting the most attention. As CNN reported earlier, the proposal would have luggage and passengers on those flights screened after they land at larger airports for connecting flights. It's  stunning that this is even seriously being considered,  says CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.  Al Qaeda and ISIS still regard aviation as a priority target—that includes aircraft where you have fewer than 60 people on board.  TSA officials say it's an old idea that returns from time to time, but with the TSA establishing a working group to analyze potential risk and cost, it's getting more attention this year. As a TSA spokesman tells the Hill, proposed cuts are  pre-decisional  and wouldn't happen  without a risk assessment to ensure the security of the aviation system.","TSA: $300M Savings Could Reduce Screenings, Marshals","TSA: $____M Savings Could Reduce Screenings, Marshals",300,Copy( 300 ),0

The story follows Hogg on the road as part of a bus tour to register young voters, and it presents a largely flattering portrait of an 18-year-old who seems poised beyond his years in front of the cameras—and as a very public target for supporters of the NRA. (One rally he leads  might be taught in future courses on political stagecraft,  writes Lisa Miller.) A personal detail that may come as a surprise: Hogg is dyslexic and didn't learn to read until the fourth grade. His younger sister, Lauren, chalks up his speaking style to that early dyslexia.  He gets absorbed in his words because he's been doubted so much,  she says.  He needs to overcompensate when he's arguing.  Perhaps less surprising is that Hogg has a very clear plan for himself over the next seven years. First, college (not sure where yet) in the fall of 2019. Then he'd like to take time off to work on somebody's presidential campaign (not sure who yet, but he says he's already been approached by candidates). Then back to school, and after graduation comes preparation for a run for Congress—he hopes to hold a seat at age 25.  I think I've come to that conclusion,  he tells Miller.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation hopes that the 35th anniversary won't arrive with the crime still unsolved: On Monday its director revealed a  critical piece of evidence : a cable repair ticket book. At a press conference, Director Stan Florence explained that the book's final ticket logs work completed at the Neilsons' apartment at 11:51am on the day of her death, reports the Norman Transcript. The book has no company name on it, the Oklahoman reports; in the bottom left corner of the ticket is a box where the employee signed off on the work, and the ticket in question contains three letters.  We want help in identifying those three letters, identifying who that person was that wrote in that book,  said Florence. The ticket book has been in the bureau's possession for years; under a state law that was altered in 2011, the bureau finally had the ability to share the evidence with the public in hopes it will bring closure to the case. The bureau said it received a number of calls within a day of revealing the ticket. The Oklahoman reports that the 21-year-old's throat was cut, and she had been stabbed a number of times.

"(Apr 5, 2011  1:41 AM CDT) The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered emergency inspections of 80 older Boeing 737s similar to the Southwest plane that suddenly cracked open last week during a flight. The order covers aircraft built with a specific process in the '80s and '90s and those that have more than 30,000 flight cycles, ABC News reports. Some 78 of the jets in question belong to Southwest Airlines—which has carried out its own inspections—and two are being used by Alaska Airlines. Inspectors must use an electro-magnetic process that detects cracks invisible to the naked eye. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor Boeing currently requires checks to be carried out on the section of aircraft that cracked open.

"(Sep 15, 2014  8:58 AM CDT) Urban Outfitters' latest Very Bad Idea: Selling a  vintage  Kent State University sweatshirt with what appears to be fake blood spattered all over it, Gawker reports. The sweatshirt, which People calls  faux-vintage,  seems to be referencing the fatal 1970 shootings of four unarmed students during a Vietnam War protest. Apparently the retailer had only one to sell, and it's now sold out; the sweatshirt then appeared on eBay with a starting bid of $550, but that auction ended with no bids. According to a screenshot from BuzzFeed, Urban Outfitters seemed to be hawking the $129 sweatshirt as an actual vintage piece; the description included the line,  Vintage Finds are handpicked vintage pieces from allover [sic] the map,  though the description didn't appear to say anything about blood, real or fake. Kent State condemned the retailer's move, Fox News reports, saying in a statement:  We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit. This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today.  Urban Outfitters then apologized in a statement, in which the retailer claimed to have removed the shirt from its website, as opposed to having actually sold the shirt.  It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State in 1970 and we are extremely saddened that this item was perceived as such,  the statement reads.  The one-of-a-kind item was purchased as part of our sun-faded vintage collection. There is no blood on this shirt nor has this item been altered in any way. The red stains are discoloration from the original shade of the shirt and the holes are from natural wear and fray.

It is what markets and the journalists who write about them like to call a 'huge beat,'  writes Neil Irwin at the Washington Post,  before adding,  Woo?  Yes, 1.7% isn't bad, but it came with a downward revision of last quarter's growth to 1.1%. But in a larger sense, these numbers just don't cut it.  With 7.6% unemployment, the nation could really use a few quarters in a row of 4%, 5%, or 6% growth,  writes Irwin. That sounds outlandish now, but it's  exactly what happened in the early 1980s, in the aftermath of a very deep recession.  The big difference? Well, consumer spending was higher, and, more significantly, exports and government spending were booming, unlike this quarter when they were negative. Something in this equation has to change, because right now 1.7% growth  isn't even mediocre. It's terrible.

"(Feb 1, 2013  9:04 AM) Tomorrow, the Russian city of Volgograd will be Stalingrad once again—temporarily. That's because the city's government unanimously voted to change the city's name six days a year to mark milestones in the country's victory in World War II. Tomorrow is the 70th anniversary of the 1943 defeat of the Nazis in the city, which will officially be called the  hero-city Stalingrad.  Sergei Zabednov, the lawmaker behind the measure, reveals a quirky way in which the name will surface tomorrow: Weathermen will be able to use it in their evening broadcasts. The New York Times notes that a certain nostalgia for Stalin and the Soviet Union seems to be taking hold across the country. Last year, just 22% of Russians saw Stalin as having a  negative role  in Russian history, compared to 60% in 1998. Still, many in Volgograd aren't too keen on the change. But Zabednov isn't buying it.  They say: 'How can you talk about Stalin? He was a despot.' Excuse me, but Peter the First was also a despot, just as bad as Stalin, but the name Petersburg has been preserved. Now, Stalingrad has been preserved as the symbol of victory.

Authorities in Waltham, about 20 miles outside of Boston, offered a $5,000 reward Tuesday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible for the recent attacks, NBC News reports. The suspect, described as a Black male between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-10 with a medium build, was  lying in wait  for his victims, said Police Chief Keith MacPherson. Lead detective Sgt. Steve McCarthy said the attacks have created a  fear factor in our city right now,  adding,  I'd be lying to you if I said I'm not losing sleep at night, you know, coming into work.  On Facebook, the city advised residents to  remain aware of their surroundings  and said police have stepped up patrols. The attacks began Nov. 10, with the first five happening at an apartment complex and another five in downtown Waltham. The assailant hasn't used a gun or knife, but struck his victims with a blunt object, according to reports.  The motive is somewhat in question but it appears to be a thrill of the assault, or someone who's very violent and enjoys seeing someone hurt by this,  MacPherson said, per the Boston Globe.  There's never been a robbery. It's always been just an assault and the assailant takes off.

"(Dec 15, 2016  9:31 AM) Regularly popping a dose of Advil or Tylenol could compromise your hearing. A new study that examined the long-term use of over-the-counter pain relievers found that women who took certain meds steadily for six years were 10% more likely to experience hearing loss, reports the New York Times. The pain relievers in question were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibruprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve). Those taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) for the same period were 9% more inclined to report hearing problems. The team did not find diminished hearing associated with aspirin use. While the mechanism behind the hearing loss is unknown and the study did not prove causation, a press release notes it adds to a growing body of evidence that these sorts of drugs are linked to auditory problems. Writing in the American Journal of Epidemiology, researchers compared long-term users with women who took the same pain meds two or more times per week for less than one year. The study involved more than 54,000 mostly white women between the ages of 48 and 73 who self-reported their usage. Lead author Brian M. Lin of Harvard tells the Times that while the amount of hearing loss was low, use of the drugs in question is so widespread that  it can have large implications for public health.  Two-thirds of American women over 60 experience hearing loss, and the study says the researchers may have found  an important modifiable contributor.  Lin says don't halt the meds, but longtime users should  talk to their doctor just to see if they really need to be on them.

An enormous bull elephant was killed on Oct. 8 just outside a national park by a German hunter who had paid $60,000 for a permit, the Telegraph reports. (The link has an image of the elephant.) Conservationists tell CNN that with tusks that weighed around 120 pounds each, the elephant was one of the biggest to be seen in the region for 50 years—and if it hadn't been shot, it could have become a tourist attraction worth a lot more than $60,000. The hunter, who has not been identified, was on a 21-day hunt that also included leopards, lions, buffalo, and rhinoceros, according to the Telegraph. The chairman of Zimbabwe's hunters and guides association tells the Telegraph that the elephant had not been seen in the country before and it was bigger than any of the other five or six  giant tuskers  shot over the last year. He says the client didn't realize just how big the elephant was until it was shot, and he suggests that authorities start collaring unique elephants if they don't want hunters to shoot them.

In what Fortune reports could be a first, a court there has fined an unidentified man the equivalent of more than $4,000 after he liked defamatory comments on Facebook that accused an animal rights activist of racism and anti-Semitism. The activist, Erwin Kessler, had been the subject of heated Facebook conversations in 2015 about which animal welfare groups should be allowed in a vegan street festival, reports the Swiss daily Tages Anzeiger. In stark contrast, a US federal court ruled in 2013 that an online  like  is protected by the First Amendment. Kessler sued over a dozen people involved in those online exchanges, several of whom have already been convicted for comments they made, reports the Guardian, but this latest fine appears to be the first time someone has been convicted for merely pressing  like.  The court, however, ruled that even though the defendant didn't write the comments, he  clearly endorsed the unseemly content and made it his own.  A defense attorney says that if courts want to prosecute people for simply liking content,  we could easily need to triple the number of judges in this country,  adding it could  easily become an assault on the freedom of expression.

Authorities say Dziminski admitted performing sex acts on the boy and taping them on her cellphone. She then sent the videos to three people who gave her cash. Child welfare officials alerted Mercer County authorities when they found a video circulating online. They say Dziminski also took nude photos of the child and nude photos of herself with the child.

"(Aug 19, 2013  5:37 PM CDT) OK, we did it. A new UN report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found  it is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010.  That  extremely likely  is important, the New York Times reports—it means the scientists are now 95% to 100% sure global warming is our fault. In the last UN report, they said they were 90% to 100% sure. The report, which was leaked by Reuters over the weekend, also found that sea levels could rise by more than 3 feet by 2100 if emissions continue at their current rate. An increase like that wouldn't just threaten tiny islands—it could endanger London, Shanghai, Venice, Sydney, and New York, says the Times. However, the scientists warn, because the report won't be published for another month, people should take what they read with a grain of salt.  The text is likely to change in response to comments from governments received in recent weeks and will also be considered by governments and scientists at a four-day approval session at the end of September,  the IPCC’s spokesman says in a statement.  It is therefore premature and could be misleading to attempt to draw conclusions from it.

The Los Angeles Times reports that eight people have died along the river nicknamed the  Killer Kern  since March, though one of those fatalities was a heart attack. At least two others remain missing. One of those pulled from the river Saturday has been identified as Michael Ramirez, a 27-year-old Orange County rapper who disappeared while swimming on June 22. Also Saturday, a 22-year-old Los Angeles man drowned after being warned about the dangers. Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service officials say they warned him and his cousins about jumping from rocks into the river that morning, Bakersfield.com reports. The warning apparently went unheeded, however, and he was dragged into the main current and underneath the surface. His body was found by a nearby campground. Authorities say the rise in drownings on the 165-mile river is likely due to visitors being unused to such high waters and fast currents, the Times reports. Last winter was one of the wettest on record and followed five years of drought. Snow melting on the Sierra Nevada has caused the Kern to swell with cold, fast-moving water.

"(Nov 3, 2012  4:50 PM CDT) A horrific story from western Nepal: Authorities are hunting for a man-eating leopard that may have killed 15 people, including a 4-year-old boy whose head was found in a forest, CNN reports. At most two leopards are behind the attacks, officials say, because man-eating leopards are so rare—and this one is unlikely to stop.  Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer,  says Maheshwor Dhakal, a government ecologist. So far the victims are all women and children in villages that border dense forests, but officials suspect the leopard of killing people in India too. The creature's strategy is simple: drag each victim into a forest and eat everything it can. Only the head—and with adult victims parts of the body—are left behind. Now officials are skirting the law against killing wild animals by offering about $300 to anyone who hunts down the animal.  There is no alternative but to kill the leopard,  says Dhakal.","Wild Leopard Ate 15 Women, Children: Officials","Wild Leopard Ate ____ Women, Children: Officials",15,Copy( 15 ),0

Police found the high school senior dead of stab wounds to her face and chest in the mall parking lot, inside her family's Buick at 4am on Dec. 20, 1979. On Wednesday morning, a suspect was finally arrested and charged in the case. Cedar Rapids Police, who procured DNA evidence in 2006 using new technology, charged Jerry Lynn Burns, 64, with first-degree murder, USA Today reports. They had been able to covertly get Burns' DNA and compare it to the DNA evidence found at the crime scene, from blood found on Martinko's clothing and the car's gear shift that did not belong to the teen, the Gazette reports. Not many details have been released, but police originally said that due to the number and location of stab wounds, Martinko's murder was considered to be personal in nature. Police have not said whether Burns may have known Martinko or whether the crime was random; nor have they commented on when and how he emerged as a suspect. Martinko was not robbed, was found fully clothed and had not been sexually assaulted. She had wounds on her hands indicating she fought back. Burns would have been about 25 years old when Martinko was murdered. Police say he denied killing the teen, but had no  plausible explanation  for his DNA allegedly being present at the scene.

But this is not a movie: Over two days, an Audi A7 Sportback (nicknamed  Jack ) made the trip with little human help, its journey aided by GPS and radar sensors that feed data to an onboard computer.

The car isn't completely independent, though—the autopilot only works up to 70mph and doesn't function in urban areas, reports Popular Mechanics. When a human needs to take the wheel, the car lets off a warning; if there's no response, it pulls over to the shoulder and comes to a stop with flashers on.

"(Jul 19, 2017  12:07 AM CDT) At least 547 members of a prestigious Catholic boys' choir in Germany were physically or sexually abused between 1945 and 1992, according to a report Tuesday. Allegations involving the Domspatzen choir were among a spate of abuse by Roman Catholic clergy in Germany that emerged in 2010, the AP reports. In 2015, lawyer Ulrich Weber was tasked with producing a report on what happened. The report said 547 boys at the Domspatzen school  with a high degree of plausibility  were victims of physical or sexual abuse, or both. It counted 500 cases of physical violence and 67 of sexual violence, committed by 49 perpetrators. At the choir's pre-school,  violence, fear, and helplessness dominated  and  violence was an everyday method,  it said.  Alongside individual motives, institutional motives—namely, breaking the will of the children with the aim of maximum discipline and dedication—formed the basis for violence.  The choir was led from 1964 to 1994 by Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI's elder brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger. Ratzinger has acknowledged slapping pupils after he took over the choir, though such punishments were commonplace in Germany at that time. The report faulted Ratzinger  in particular for 'looking away' or for failing to intervene.  Bishop Rudolf Voderholzer has announced plans to offer victims compensation of between $5,730 and $22,930 each by the end of this year.

The current owners, a married couple with three children, bought it in June 2014 for nearly $1.4 million. But they refused to move in due to eerie letters they say they received from a person with a  mentally disturbed fixation  on the home. The couple took the house off the market last summer after suing the previous owners. But they put the house up for sale again last week. The six-bedroom, 3½-bathroom home is in Westfield, 25 miles west of New York City. According to an online post, it has high ceilings, fireplaces, and  elegant foyers,  and sits on nearly a half-acre. The listing price is $1.25 million. Current owners Derek and Maria Broaddus claim in their suit that they should have been warned about the letter writer. They want the former owners to refund them the purchase price and pay punitive damages. They claim one of the letters they received read:  Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them too (sic) me.  In their suit, they claim they are unable to live in the home  without extreme anxiety and fear for their children's safety and wellbeing.  The former owners, John and Andrea Woods, have called the couple's account fiction and moved earlier this year to have the suit dismissed.

The teenagers were in San Diego to compete in a long-distance swim, and 64 of them (plus three coaches) went in the water against the advice of lifeguards, says Sgt. Ed Harris of San Diego Lifeguards, explaining that it was windy at the beach, the waves were two to four feet high, and the water was about 59 degrees. When the group was about half a mile from shore, some swimmers started panicking, which triggered others to panic, and  it just snowballed into a mass rescue,  Harris says. Ultimately, 22 students were pulled out of the water by lifeguards on surfboards, jet skis, and boats, ABC News reports. A 16-year-old girl who had swallowed some water was unconscious and beginning to show signs of hypothermia; she was taken to a local hospital but was expected to be released, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The teens attend Rancho Verde High School, about 88 miles north of La Jolla; a rep from the school district says they were briefed on ocean swimming by a lifeguard before entering the water, but the lifeguards say their advice was to delay the swim.

The Inuit—who consumed a diet mainly of whales, seals, and fish—rarely had heart attacks, and researchers speculated in the 1970s that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish guard against them, reports the New York Times. But decades' worth of fish oil pills may have been better dumped down the drain: A new study published in Science provides what the Times calls an  intriguing new twist  to the omega-3 story. In analyzing the DNA of 191 Greenland residents of almost entirely Inuit descent, scientists found they boasted genetic variants that may help them consume high amounts of fat without negative consequences. The find suggests  lessons from the Inuit cannot be extrapolated to other populations,  per study author Rasmus Nielsen. Their genetic mutations helped keep fasting insulin and LDL cholesterol levels low, reports Reuters. The Times notes that Inuit with two copies of one gene variant in particular were an average one inch shorter and weighed 10 pounds less than those without it. The genetic variants—which may have come into play 20,000 years ago— regulate how much of these omega-3s and omega-6s you make yourself naturally,  says Nielsen, per NPR.  We saw that the Inuit have such a high diet of omega-3s, so they produce much less of it themselves.  This is  perhaps the most extreme example to date of a genetic adaptation to a specific diet,  he adds. In speaking to NPR, a Harvard Medical School geneticist advises caution: It's tough  to go beyond the known biology of these genes and make connections to weight,  says Joel Hirschhorn.

The 7.8-magnitude earthquake, the strongest to hit Nepal in more than eight decades, triggered a deadly avalanche in the Mount Everest region. NBC News reports the country's Tourism Ministry has thus far confirmed that 10 are dead, but the toll could very well rise. Indeed, USA Today reports an unknown number of people are missing, and the AP says some climbers may be cut off on routes leading to the summit.

The boy's father, Justin Foss Sr., 27, was booked into jail Saturday on a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, according to jail records. Justin's parents told an officer that their son  found one of their guns under the couch where they hid it and shot himself in the head,  the sheriff's report states. Jail records do not indicate whether the father has a lawyer who could be reached for comment. Data compiled by the AP and the USA TODAY Network in 2016 found that a child was shot to death every other day somewhere in the United States, on average. Deaths and injuries spiked for children under 5, and were more prevalent in Southern states, the research shows. In most cases of children killing themselves with guns,  it's clear from the facts that they were preventable, and that just makes them even more tragic,  Lindsay Nichols, federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said Monday. The California-based nonprofit provides technical advice to lawmakers, law enforcers, citizens and others trying to curb gun violence.  I think it's dependent on our nation's leaders and policy makers to really make this a priority and recognize that these kinds of tragedies are happening way too often,  Nichols said.

But the trial that followed was hardly simple and set a vast historic precedent when Sickles became the first American to successfully plead temporary insanity, Lapham's Quarterly reports. On February 27, 1859, Sickles gunned down his friend Philip Barton Key (whose father wrote  The Star-Spangled Banner ) in Washington, DC, for having an affair with Sickles' wife. Then came the court case, where one of Sickles' seven lawyers claimed it was manslaughter, not murder, perpetrated in  a state of heat  that put Sickles above  the pale of accountability to the criminal law.  He added that it's  no matter how a man becomes insane; is he insane, this is the question?  The district attorney saw it differently, saying Sickles planned the attack and carried three pistols to the crime scene. But public opinion sided with Sickles, as did Harper's and the New York Times. And Sickles' theatricality won over jurors, moving some to tears when he cried during a friend's testimony and had to be escorted from the courtroom. The jury needed just 30 minutes to find him not guilty. In a twist, public opinion turned against Sickles when he made up with his wife, Teresa (who had only cheated on him over his  compulsive womanizing,  according to an old Times review of a Sickles biography). And when Sickles became ambassador to Spain, after Teresa's death by tuberculosis, he supposedly hooked up with Spain's deposed queen, Isabella II—who was married at the time.

"(Mar 17, 2015  4:09 PM CDT) Some 2,000 migrating snow geese have died in eastern Idaho, likely from avian cholera, which comes on quickly, causes convulsions and erratic flight, and can kill birds midflight, wildlife officials say. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says it collected the dead birds over the past several days at wildlife management areas near the towns of Terreton and Roberts. Authorities said the geese, known for their distinctive white bodies and black wingtips, were migrating from the Southwest and Mexico to breeding grounds on Alaska's north coast. It's unclear where they picked up the bacteria, said Steve Schmidt, a Fish and Game supervisor.  Outbreaks of avian cholera have occurred sporadically in the region over the past few decades,  he said.  The important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible, to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds,  Schmidt said. Biologists at the Mud Lake Wildlife Management Area near Terreton said about 20 eagles also were in the area, though it's unclear if they were exposed. According to the USGS' National Wildlife Health Center, avian cholera spreads so quickly in infected birds that some with no previous signs of illness can die while in flight and fall out of the sky. Health experts say humans are not at a high risk of infection. Schmidt estimated that up to 10,000 snow geese pass through eastern Idaho each March. They spend a week or two and feed on waste grain in nearby wheat fields before continuing north.",2K Geese Drop Dead in Idaho,____K Geese Drop Dead in Idaho,2,"Paraphrase( 2,000 , K )",1

According to a new study, that series of events is a real possibility, and would threaten more than a quarter of a million Californians. The US Geological Survey study, released to coincide with Tsunami Awareness Week, identifies the areas most likely to be hit, and puts a figure to them: 267,000 California residents live in  tsunami-inundation  zones, and another 169,000 work in them; and that's not counting the tourists. As AFP explains, the Cascadia Subduction Zone fault named in the study has produced at least seven tsunamis in the last three millennia, spaced as little as 140 years apart; the last occurred in 1700.  A future CSZ-related earthquake (likely magnitude 8 or larger) would create a series of tsunami waves possibly 8 meters ... or higher that would inundate these communities in 15 to 20 minutes after initial ground shaking,  the study notes.

Attorney Benjamin Crump tweeted bodycam footage of the incident Sunday, which has already racked up 2.3 million hits:  Unbelievable,  he writes, adding that Key West Police  used 'scared straight' tactics on 8yo boy with special needs. He's 3.5 ft tall and 64 lbs, but they thought it was appropriate to handcuff and transport him to an adult prison for processing!!  According to Crump, the boy was placed with a substitute teacher who didn't know about his special needs  and who escalated the situation by using her hands to forcibly move him.  Police say trouble began when the teacher saw the boy sitting oddly at a lunch table and asked him to sit with her, per the Washington Post. The boy apparently said  Don't put your hands on me,  and the teacher took him for walk, during which he cursed and punched her in the chest. But Crump says the boy has behavioral and emotional disabilities and should have been in the school's individualized educational program. Now Crump—who also represents George Floyd's family—plans to file a civil lawsuit against the officers involved.

Why are collectors willing to pay so much for something Clapton touched—or even just a clone of something Clapton touched? Yale researchers explain that it all has to do with  magical thinking.  Certain items, like those owned or touched by celebrities, are thought to be imbued with  contagious magic,  making them seem more valuable than they actually are, the New York Times reports. Researchers found that the  celebrity  in question doesn’t even have to have a positive association; one experiment found people were still interested in buying items that once belonged to Saddam Hussein. Even replicas of such celebrity items can hold a similar  imitative magic  to collectors, turning them into  fetishes —objects believed to hold supernatural powers. Collectors often believe that using instruments or even guitar strings once owned by a celebrity can improve their playing. Though it may sound odd, scientists say such beliefs are actually instinctual—and may stem from the Dark Ages, when those with a belief in contagion stayed away from plague sufferers, and thus survived.",Mystery Solved: Why We'll Pay $1M for a Clapton Guitar,Mystery Solved: Why We'll Pay $____M for a Clapton Guitar,1,Copy( 1 ),0

The ring, which had been in England since the 15th century, sold at auction for more than $400,000 (about 30 times its estimated worth), the Telegraph reports. Purchased by the Puy du Fou foundation, which runs a historical theme park in western France, the ring arrived home on Friday, the BBC reports. The foundation's president praised the  glorious return  of a  French treasure.  Inscribed with  IHS  and  MAR  (for Jesus and Mary), the silver gilt devotional ring was made in about 1400. It will be officially unveiled this month, according to reports. Joan of Arc herself describes the ring in transcripts from the trial that ultimately led to her 1431 execution in Normandy (then ruled by the English) on charges of being a heretic and sorcerer. It is believed that she gave the ring to England's Cardinal Henry Beaufort the day before she was killed at age 19. Centuries later, a man bought the ring in a 1947 auction for about $250.

But now  I think my days of hacking are done,  Hammond told the Guardian just before sentencing.  That's a role for somebody else now.  In his statement to the court, Hammond said he  targeted law enforcement systems because of the racism and inequality with which the criminal law is enforced.  (Read it in full here.) He got arrested after linking with a well-known hacker-turned-informant called Sabu.  It is kind of funny that here they are sentencing me for hacking Stratfor, but at the same time as I was doing that an FBI informant was suggesting to me foreign targets to hit,  he says in the Guardian interview.

President Nana Akufo-Addo says the 533 new infections in Tema, a fishing port 17 miles west of the capital, Accra, bring the country's total to 4,300, with 22 deaths, CNN reports. He mentioned the worker's case in a public address Sunday but did not elaborate on the details, reports France24. The president, who recently lifted a 21-day lockdown in major cities, said schools and borders will remain closed and a ban of public gatherings will stay in effect. He said the Tema factory was shut down for a week and has been disinfected. The surge in cases is a setback for Ghana, which lifted its lockdown after stepping up testing capacity and testing over 161,000 people, more than any other African country except South Africa, Bloomberg reports.",Ghana President: Fish Plant Worker Infected 533 Others,Ghana President: Fish Plant Worker Infected ____ Others,533,Copy( 533 ),0
"(Apr 21, 2015  12:12 AM CDT) An Illinois county with more people than most states is going to stop prosecuting minor pot cases as part of a major overhaul of how it deals with low-level drug offenses. Officials in Cook County—which includes Chicago, and is America's second most populous with around 5.2 million people—say the goal is to steer repeat offenders toward treatment instead of jail, the Chicago Tribune reports.  The methods in which we are handling low-level drug cases here in Cook County are simply not working,  State's Attorney Anita Alvarez told NBC, estimating that her office dealt with 15,000 misdemeanor marijuana cases last year. Under the current system,  we continue to see the same individuals revolving in and out of our criminal justice system with no meaningful impact or outcome and at a significant cost to taxpayers,  Alvarez said. The overhaul—which was welcomed by a Chicago police spokesman and the county sheriff's office—also applies to possession of small amounts of drugs including cocaine and heroin, which Alvarez says accounted for around 10,000 of the 40,000 felony cases her office handled last year, the Tribune reports. After she announced the overhaul yesterday, Alvarez said she had no idea of the date's significance for pot smokers, reports the Chicago Sun-Times.  April 20 to me is just that, April 20,  she said.

It’s unclear if the soldiers have been charged with actually killing him, or of driving him to commit suicide—one military official told his family in October that fellow soldiers had berated him with ethnic slurs and physically abused him. The charges leveled include dereliction of duty, making a false statement, assault, negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment. In one incident, previously reported in the New York Times, fellow soldiers dragged Chen from his bed and across the floor after he neglected to turn off a water heater after a shower. Chen’s death and alleged mistreatment has angered Chinese-American activists, one of whom argues that even if the men didn’t pull the trigger, their actions  led to his death and they must be prosecuted for killing him.

The Mets and Beltran  agreed to mutually part ways,  the team said in a statement Thursday. MLB issued its report Monday on the scandal, saying that the effort to steal signs was driven by players. Beltran, who was in his final season, was the only player named in the report but was not disciplined.  I've always taken pride in being a leader and doing things the right way, and in this situation, I failed,  Beltran said in a statement to ESPN.  As a veteran player on the team, I should've recognized the severity of the issue and truly regret the actions that were taken.  Beltran, who was hired last month, is the third manager to be removed in the fallout. He would have been the Mets' first Latino manager, per NBC. Analysts differ on whether anyone fired this week will have an MLB job again, per ESPN. Beltran, 42, who was a nine-time All-Star as a player, said Thursday that he hopes to be able to return to baseball someday. His career earnings were about $222 million.

"(Dec 16, 2019  3:47 PM) Mariah Carey has hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time since 2008 ... but the song in the top spot was released in 1994. Yes, on Monday, Carey's holiday classic,  All I Want for Christmas Is You,  hit No. 1 on the chart for the first time ever a quarter-century after it first came out, the New York Times reports. In doing so, it set a record for the track that took the longest to make it to the top spot; it's also the first Christmas song to be in that spot since  The Chipmunk Song  in 1958. The song has gotten bigger and bigger for Carey (who now calls herself the  Queen of Christmas,  per CNN) over the years; there are tie-ins in the form of a children's book and an animated film, plus online content, a mini-documentary, a deluxe edition of Carey's Merry Christmas album that includes four different versions of the song, and of course, a bunch of Christmas shows Carey has been performing since 2014. Carey's song is widely seen as the last modern-era Christmas classic.  There are the classics—the standards that everybody grew up with—and then there are the reinterpretations or new originals. Mariah lives in that sweet spot of both,  explains a senior analyst for Nielsen Music. Why was this the year for No. 1? The Times pegs recent listening shifts including the popularity of streaming, ubiquitous holiday playlists, new versions of the video recently added to YouTube, and lots of marketing—Carey has been pushing the song each year at the start of the season, including with a cute video as soon as Halloween ended this year.

Some 23,000 ER visits each year are attributed to everything from herbal pills to vitamins that cause cardiovascular problems, severe allergic reactions, and vomiting, particularly in young adults, according to a new study from the FDA and CDC. They tracked ER visits from 63 hospitals over 10 years, per the New York Times and Time, and found about 10% of patients needed to be hospitalized; the study didn't review whether any deaths occurred. Though prescription drugs send 30 times as many people to the ER annually, most are older adults; 28% of people who visited the ER because of supplements were 20 to 34, and half of those visits involved weight-loss or energy aids, per NBC News. Dietary supplements aren't required to carry warning labels about side effects, don't require FDA approval, and are generally  considered safe until proved otherwise,  notes the Times.  The system has failed,  says a Harvard professor who calls the findings  disheartening.   It's failing to protect consumers from very serious harms.  Industry officials claim half of all Americans use dietary supplements, meaning 23,000 ER visits represents a sliver of users.

Though the judge acknowledged the bank didn’t follow  best  security practices, he ultimately ruled the customer should have done more to protect the account, Wired and BankInfoSecurity report. Hackers gained access to Patco Construction Company’s banking credentials by sending a malicious email to employees and subsequently installing a password-stealing Trojan.

The family-owned business didn’t realize the problem until nearly $600,000 in fraudulent transfers were allowed to go through. The bank was able to block $240,000 of the transfers; the company lost the rest of the money.

The Ohio woman was left disfigured and bedridden in a hospital after her ex-boyfriend doused her in gasoline and set her on fire on Aug. 2, 2015.  No one expected that she'd make it 48 hours,  Bowes tells the Columbus Dispatch. The mother of two—who underwent 59 surgeries, per WCMH—instead made it 696 days, dying Tuesday at age 33. An official cause of death has not been released. However, officials with the Franklin County Coroner's Office expect an autopsy will show she died as a result of injuries from the attack, which literally melted parts of her body. In fact, prosecutor Ron O'Brien is already building a homicide case against Malinowski’s attacker. In December, Michael Slager, 42, was sentenced to the maximum 11 years for felonious assault, aggravated arson, and possession of criminal tools. But O'Brien says it was always his office's intention  to pursue a homicide charge  if Malinowski died. Before her death, Malinowski helped inspire Judy's Law, which would allow for longer sentences in cases where victims are permanently disfigured or incapacitated from the use of an accelerant. The Ohio Senate is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday or Thursday, per WSYX. State Rep. Jim Hughes, who introduced it, tells the Dispatch that Malinowski refused to take her pain meds when she first met him  so that she could be her sharpest, at her best, to explain why this legislation was so important.

Suvir Mirchandani, 14, wanted to find a way to make his many school handouts more sustainable. It all boiled down to a single liquid: After all,  ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,  he tells CNN. Suvir collected random teachers' handouts, then picked out the most commonly used letters—e, t, a, o, and r—and used four different fonts to determine which typeface used the least ink. He even weighed the printouts and graphed the ink usage, and with its thinner strokes, Garamond was the clear winner. Suvir found that switching to the font could reduce his school's ink consumption by 24%, saving up to $21,000 per year. But here's the kicker: When Suvir applied his findings to documents from the Government Printing Office—the Government Services Administration spends an estimated $467 million annually on ink—the results were basically the same. If the government switched exclusively to Garamond, it could save almost 30% per year, or $136 million, Suvir notes. Get the states on board, and another $234 million could be kept in pocket.

"(Dec 12, 2015  11:30 AM) There has yet to be a confirmed US collision between a drone and a manned aircraft, but there's a growing number of close calls as drones fly where they least belong—near airports. A report released Friday counted at least 241 reports of close encounters between drones and manned aircraft that meet the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of a near-collision, including 28 incidents in which pilots had to veer out of the way. The analysis by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone found that 90 of the close drone encounters involved commercial jets. The FAA defines a near-collision as two aircraft flying within 500 feet of each other. In 51 of the incidents studied, the drone-to-aircraft clearance was 50 feet or less, the report said. Most of the sightings occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet. Those are spaces in which the FAA prohibits drones from flying, raising questions about the effectiveness of the rules. The cities with the most incidents were New York, Newark, Los Angeles, and Miami. The report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that it's hard for pilots to judge their distance from another object when flying at high speeds. The majority of the incidents, 64%, were sightings of drones in the vicinity of other aircraft with no immediate threat of collision.

"(Mar 11, 2016  4:15 PM) A South African teenager vacationing in Mozambique may have found part of a wing from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which his family dismissed as  rubbish  and his mother nearly threw away, he said Friday. On Dec. 30, Liam Lotter was strolling on a beach in southern Mozambique, near the resort town of Xai Xai, when he spotted a gray piece of debris washed up on the sand, he recalled. It had rivet holes along the edge and the number 676EB stamped on it, convincing him he had found a piece of an aircraft. So he dragged the piece back to his family's vacation home. The curved piece of debris is about 3.3 feet long, and about half that length wide, his father Casper Lotter said. His parents dismissed it as a  piece of rubbish  that was probably debris from a boat, with his uncle making fun of him for dragging it around, but the 18-year-old insisted on bringing it back to South Africa to research the fragment. He ultimately set it aside; it was only when Lotter read about another piece of possible debris from the missing airliner also found in Mozambique, about 186 miles from where he had made his discovery, that he resumed his probe.  I was very shocked—Mozambique, similar color, similar area,  the teen said of the piece discovered by an American man.  He described it similarly to what I'm looking at right now.  A spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority tells the AP,  We have arranged for collection of the part, which will be sent to Australia as they are the ones appointed by Malaysia to identify parts found.",Another Possible Piece of MH370 Debris Found,Another Possible Piece of MH____ Debris Found,370,Copy( 370 ),0

Wookey Hole Caves has advertised for a witch willing to live in the site's caverns and practice her—or his—trade for an annual salary of $75,000. Applicants need to have strong cackling skills, the site's manager says, and can't be allergic to cats.  Wookey Hole wants the appointee to go about her everyday business as a hag, so that people passing through the caves can get a sense of what the place was like in the Dark Ages,  said an official at the tourist attraction.  This was when an old woman lived in the caves with some goats and a dog, causing a variety of social ills, including crop failures and disease.  Under current law, however, the site can't discriminate against male witches, so the  hag  might be a guy.","Help Wanted: Witch, Good W/Potions, $75K","Help Wanted: Witch, Good W/Potions, $____K",75,"Paraphrase( 75,000 , K )",1
"(Jan 18, 2015  6:11 AM) A record 6 million people poured into Manila's rain-soaked streets and its biggest park today as Pope Francis ended his Asian pilgrimage with an appeal for Filipinos to protect their young from sin and vice so they can become missionaries of the faith. The Vatican received the figure officially from local authorities and said it was a record, surpassing the 5 million who turned out for St. John Paul II's final Mass in the same park in 1995. Francis dedicated the final homily of his weeklong Asian trip to children. It was a reflection of the importance that the Vatican places on Asia as one of the few places where Catholic numbers are growing—and on the Philippines as the region's largest Catholic nation.  We need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed, cherished and protected,  Francis said in his homily.  And we need to care for our young people, not allowing them to be robbed of hope and condemned to a life on the streets.  Francis made a triumphant entry into Rizal Park riding a popemobile, wearing the same cheap, plastic yellow rain poncho handed out to masses during his visit to the typhoon-hit city of Tacloban a day earlier. The crowd—a sea of colorful rain ponchos spread out across 148 acres of parkland—erupted in shrieks of joy when he drove by. Earlier today, Francis drew a huge crowd to Manila's Catholic university, where he spoke off the cuff in his native Spanish to respond to 12-year-old Glyzelle Palomar, who wept as she asked Francis why children suffer so much.  Why is God allowing something like this to happen, even to innocent children?  asked Glyzelle, a child rescued from the street.  And why are there so few who are helping us?  A visibly moved Francis said he had no answer.  Only when we are able to cry are we able to come close to responding to your question,  he said.  Those who are discarded cry. But those who are living a life that is more or less without need, we don't know how to cry.",John Paul Who? Record 6M Turn Out for Francis,John Paul Who?

Three survived and one remains missing in Hildale—home of the Warren Jeffs polygamist sect. Three sisters, Della Johnson and Naomi and Josephine Jessop, are among the dead and the latter two were married to the same man, Joseph N. Jessop, he tells the Salt Lake Tribune. The remaining victims of what is thought to be the deadliest single weather event in the state, all children aged 4 to perhaps their early teens, have not been identified, reports the Spectrum. Elsewhere, at least four others, aged 40 to 50, were killed while canyoneering in Zion National Park's Keyhole Canyon, CNN reports. Three from the group are missing. The Hildale victims had been watching the flooding from a park which sits in a canyon, the mayor says. On their way home, they came across a flooded wash—connected to the Short Creek Wash, which serves as a drainage ditch—and exited their vehicles to get a better look. Suddenly,  a huge flow of debris and water … came onto the street behind them and washed them into the ravine, and the dropoff there is 20, 30 feet. So the witnesses say the vehicles were just gone,  the mayor says, per CNN. A witness adds the water rose seven feet in 30 seconds.  It was a wall,  he says.  It was boom, boom, boom.

"(Mar 14, 2019  6:14 AM CDT) Less than a week after the head of the Colombo crime family died, the Gambino crime family has lost its own reputed boss. The demise Wednesday night of Francesco  Frank  Cali, however, was much more violent and untimely than the passing of Carmine  The Snake  Persico, who died in a North Carolina medical center at age 85 last Thursday: Cali was shot six times in front of his Staten Island home by someone in a blue pickup truck, shortly after 9pm, the New York Daily News reports. A 911 caller said the 53-year-old was mowed down by the perpetrator's vehicle before he was shot, though that hasn't been confirmed. Cali was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The New York Times notes it's been more than three decades since a Mafia boss was murdered in New York, although lower-level mobsters have recently met that fate. In fact, several outlets have made comparisons between Cali's shooting and that of erstwhile Gambino boss Paul Castellano, who was gunned down in front of a New York City steakhouse in 1985, a killing orchestrated by John Gotti, who then took over the family. CNN notes that since taking over the crime syndicate as acting boss in 2015, Cali stayed under the radar more than the flashier Gotti, who was put away for murder and racketeering in 1992 and died in prison a decade later. The Daily News reports that Cali's ascension in the crime family was a rapid one, with the feds even trying (to no avail) to keep him away from other mobsters after he got out of prison in the late 2000s after serving time for an extortion scheme.  There are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing,  a police statement notes of his death, per the BBC.","34 Years After a Big Mob Boss Killing, Another Violent Hit","____ Years After a Big Mob Boss Killing, Another Violent Hit",34,"Subtract( 2019 , 1985 )",1
"(Apr 5, 2011  6:51 AM CDT) The ozone layer above the Arctic withered by 40% this winter, according to the UN's weather agency, a stark increase from the previous seasonal record of 30%. The loss was driven largely by frigid conditions in the stratosphere—though surface temperatures were actually warmer than normal—and lingering chemicals banned in 1987's Montreal Protocol.  The 2011 ozone loss shows that we have to remain vigilant and keep a close eye on the situation in the Arctic in the coming years,  the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization says. Late last month, wind blew the hole over Greenland and Scandinavia, where the WMO asked that people heed national ozone-level alerts. The BBC notes that though the amount of chemical pollution driving ozone loss is falling, the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to persist until 2045 to 2060.

"(Jun 14, 2016  12:17 PM CDT) It may have just become more difficult for Donald Trump to harp on Hillary Clinton's email woes. The Trump Organization apparently had an appetite for destruction when it came to its own emails, per a 2004 lawsuit in which his casino company was embroiled, reports USA Today. In the suit, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts sought profits from a casino developed by ex-employee Richard Fields and Florida's Seminole Tribe, a deal Trump's company claimed it had been pursuing while Fields still worked there. The defendants rebutted that if Trump had really been in negotiations with the tribe, there would be emails to back it up. The judge agreed and told Trump's company to hand it all over. Which is when it got weird: Trump company's lawyer said in a 2006 hearing that the company used to erase emails and had zero remaining from 1996 to 2001.  Every year everything was just wiped out and deleted from pretty much everybody's computers,  the company's general counsel testified. The lawyer also said Trump didn't use email himself, and a Trump IT director testified that company executives used dial-up Internet until 2001. It seemed especially odd that this was the case, USA Today notes, since Trump had launched a  blazing-fast  Internet provider in 1998 and boasted he'd wire Trump Tower with it. The defendants in the case balked, claiming Trump's company kept  destroying data and evidence  even after the case had been filed. And Jerry Streitfeld, the now-retired judge of that case, tells USA Today:  I was a bit incredulous that an organization of that significance doesn't do email.

Aaron Judge followed LeMahieu with an opposite-field drive into the right field stands. It was the first home run since April 20 for Judge, who returned Friday from an oblique injury that sidelined him for two months.

Cruz began speaking at 2:41pm Eastern yesterday and got some breaks from peers including Rand Paul and Mike Lee. But Cruz had a deadline of sorts—he had to stop by 1pm today so a scheduled procedural vote on the House's controversial spending bill, the one that would defund ObamaCare, could take place.  The only path … is to stand together,  Cruz said shortly before relinquishing the floor, reports the Hill. As expected, that procedural vote passed easily—in fact, by a unanimous vote of 100-0, reports the Washington Post. It simply opens up debate in the Senate on the House measure—and paves the way for Harry Reid and Democrats to restore ObamaCare funding.

Because the water doesn't have enough oomph to push waste out of sewer pipes, a not-so-pleasant odor wafts throughout the city at times, explains the San Francisco Chronicle. As a remedy, the city plans to buy $14 million of concentrated bleach—a 3-year supply—to disinfect wastewater before it goes into the bay. That's on top of a $100 million investment to upgrade plants over 5 years to cut down on the stink. The new solution  translates into 8.5 million pounds of bleach either being poured down city drains or into the drinking water supply every year,  notes the Chronicle. Adds a blogger at Cafe Mom:  For a city that believes Happy Meals are evil attempts to contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic, you’d think San Francisco would have a problem with bleach being dumped into the ground.

In an apparent ambush, the female suspect shot an officer in the back of the head as he refilled his soft drink, killing him immediately, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. She then shot the other officer as he tried to draw his pistol. The two officers are Alyn Beck, 42, and Igor Soldo, 32, officials said.

The shooters then took the officers' guns and ammunition and crossed the street to Walmart, where witnesses say shots were fired. In one version, the shooters got in a gunfight with a citizen carrying a concealed weapon. Police confirmed that a civilian just inside Walmart's front doors was shot dead. The gunfire triggered chaos inside, where people hid for cover and ran out the doors. There were  literally a thousand  witnesses to the attack, an assistant sheriff told the Las Vegas Sun.

The blistering editorial calls such firearms  weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection  and urges Americans to direct their anger at the leaders are supposed to keep them safe but  place more importance on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms.

Of the 1.6 million veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, a hefty 45% are applying for injury-related compensation, well up from the estimated 21% who filed for help after the Gulf War in the 1990s. Almost one-third have been granted disability so far. And those applying for benefits in the last year claimed as many as 14 ailments—a huge jump from the average of four among Vietnam War vets and two among those who fought in Korea. The increased percentage of disability filings is reflective of improvements in battlefield care and body armor, which are allowing soldiers to survive what would have once been fatal injuries. Of new veterans who have sought VA care, more than 1,600 have lost a limb, 156 are blind, and thousands more are disfigured by injuries, with 200 possibly needing face transplants.

The 73-year-old is now coming forward with what he believes to be the story of the ships, and it's a tale of Native Americans battling Colonists—on the water. Demers' own story begins with some dropped air tanks. He accidentally lost them in the water during a dive off Salamander Point in New Castle (it's near Portsmouth, and just south of the Maine border) decades ago, and when he dove to retrieve them some 16 feet below the surface, he came across two cannons.  I put my hand on one of them and I said, 'Ray, you are going to spend the rest of your life studying this site' ... and, you know what?  he tells Foster's Daily Democrat.  I did.  Though not a trained archaeologist, he tried to approach the scene as a professional would, with great care to avoid contamination.

By relying on a 1959 book, input from Colonial Willamsburg's then-chief archaeologist, and the name Darracott, Demers was led to George Jackson and Sylvester Lakeman, men he believes commanded privateers and attempted to  engage  Native Americans who had themselves seized hold of a privateer and were attacking fishing ships in the area.

According to a recent study looking at five children under 6 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, four of them had digestive tract problems, including diarrhea and vomiting, as the first symptoms, LiveScience reports.  Most children are only mildly affected by COVID-19 and the few severe cases often have underlying health issues,  said the lead author, Dr. Wenbin Li.  It is easy to miss its diagnosis in the early stage, when a child has non-respiratory symptoms or suffers from another illness.  He suspects the children were infected via the digestive tract.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office rejected filing a misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 because the statute of limitations had passed. Days before Huth spoke to police, she accused Cosby in a civil lawsuit of forcing her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 years old. Cosby's attorney said that Huth attempted to extort $250,000 from the comedian before she sued and that she'd attempted to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago. (Another of Cosby's accusers may have found a way around the statute of limitations.)",Cosby Won't Face Charges in 1974 Case,Cosby Won't Face Charges in ____ Case,1974,Copy( 1974 ),0
"(Feb 18, 2015  9:43 AM) Louis Demetriades and Renate Stumpf's marriage ended 43 years ago, but in December, they spoke again for the first time in years. Apparently the flames were rekindled, because on Valentine's Day, Demetriades drove all the way from Tennessee to a Walmart in Fort Smith, Ark., where Stumpf works ... and asked her to marry him again.  Hey, good-lookin',  he said, while holding up a sign that said  Happy Valentine's Day! Will you marry me?  A shocked Stumpf hugged and kissed him ( I just talked to you this morning!  she said) before jokingly answering no, then  yes, but not today,  as a Fox 5 video shows. She explains to ABC News that she just wanted to tease her ex, but the truth is,  he's changed for the better, I've come to realize.  Both are now 75.  Forty-three years is a long time and to say yes right away, I'm going to have to test him a little bit first!  the newly engaged Stumpf told Fox.  I will marry him though, because he's a good man.  The couple first met at an army base in Germany in 1959 when they were 18; she worked in the kitchen, and he was a soldier. Their first marriage lasted 12 years and they had three children together. After divorcing, they both remarried, but reconnected after their second spouses both died.  When we saw each other again last December, we knew right then we still loved each other for sure. That love has never passed,  Stumpf says. She's worked for Walmart for 25 years, KFSM reports, and Demetriades explains that he proposed there  because she has so many friends here and I knew she would like to share that with them.

Police believe the incident was the result of a dispute between the gunman and one of the victims, not a random mass shooting, reports the Indianapolis Star. Police say the suspect entered the Washington Square Mall and opened fire on a man he apparently knew near a Target store.

In a July 12 Facebook post, Kelli Travers-Stafford wrote that her daughter Alexi mistakenly ate one of the cookies at a friend's house despite her peanut allergy, because the top of the familiar red packaging was peeled back, hiding the Reese's label. She says Alexi felt tingling in her mouth on June 25 and they administered two Epipens but Alexi quickly went into anaphylactic shock, stopped breathing, and died within an hour and a half of eating the cookie.

The first train left the station at East 96th Street at noon after a speech by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who pushed to meet a New Year's Day deadline for the long-delayed project, the AP reports.  I hope when you go down there you really feel how much hard work and time and patience it's taken to get to this point,  Cuomo said.  It's incredible. This is not your grandfather's station.  The nearly 2-mile segment adds stations along Second Avenue at 96th, 86th, and 72nd streets and a new connection to an existing subway line at 63rd Street. The line was first envisioned in 1919. Seen as crucial to alleviating congestion in the nation's biggest subway system, it is on a line expected to carry about 200,000 riders a day. The entire system transports about 5.6 million riders on an average weekday. The mood was festive on the first train, with many riders wearing hats that read Second Avenue Station. The city's transportation board was ready to award contracts for a Second Avenue subway in 1929, but the stock market crash and the Great Depression derailed the plan. Ground was broken in 1972, but a fiscal crisis in the city slammed the brakes on the project again. The project finally got into high gear when major tunneling work began in 2007.

Cops arrived at a Randallstown, Md., apartment just before 9:30am to serve arrest warrants on a man living there and on Korryn Gaines, wanted for being a court no-show for a March traffic stop in which she was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and traffic violations, Police Chief Jim Johnson says. The story, per Johnson: Even though cops could hear people on the other side of the door, no one answered when they knocked and IDed themselves, so they used a landlord's key to enter. Inside sat Gaines with the 5-year-old on her lap and a long gun pointed at them. After hours of negotiation, tensions rose around 3pm when Gaines said she was going to kill the cops, at which point an officer fired a round at her, says Johnson. Gaines returned fire, and officers shot again, causing her death. NBC News reports the 5-year-old was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; it's not clear whose gunfire wounded him. New York Daily News columnist Shaun King points out what he says is Gaines' Instagram account, showing what he says on Twitter is  a woman DEEPLY bothered and disturbed by police brutality.

The San Bernardino Sun reports that 28-year-old Enrique Marquez—who was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and making a false statement on federal firearms-purchase forms—was sentenced Friday to 20 years in prison for his role in the December 2015 shooting that left 14 dead and nearly two dozen wounded. The two perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were killed in a police shootout shortly after the attack. Marquez, who pleaded guilty to the charges against him three years ago, had said on gun purchase paperwork in 2011 and 2012 he was buying guns for his own use, but instead he sold them to Farook, a neighbor he'd been plotting with to carry out attacks at a local freeway and college; that plan was eventually nixed. Prosecutors had wanted 25 years for Marquez, saying that despite his claims of having a mental illness, he was highly intelligent and was aware of what he was doing.  His IQ is probably higher than anybody's in the courtroom,  Assistant US Attorney Melanie Sartoris said Friday.  He knew better.  Marquez's defense team, meanwhile, had hoped for a five-year sentence, arguing he'd sold his assault-style rifles to Farook  to shoot, not to shoot people,  and that the previous aborted attack plan was just a vague hypothetical. The AP notes Marquez seemed emotionless as his sentence was handed down Friday.  He's a terrorist,  the father of one of the victims told the judge.

That might be of little solace to the 106 million Capital One credit card customers and applicants who had their data stolen in late March. Paige Thompson, 33, was arrested Monday in Seattle. The Wall Street Journal pieces together her background, speaking with sources who said she formerly worked for Amazon Web Services; a criminal complaint describes her as working as a systems engineer at an unnamed cloud-computing company between 2015 and 2016. Thompson allegedly got through a misconfigured Capital One firewall, enabling her to reach customer data stored in the Amazon cloud. Capital One learned of the exposure on July 17 after someone reportedly boasted about having the data in an online group, reports the Washington Post. Most of the stolen data came from personal and small business credit card applications submitted between 2005 and this year.

"(Dec 5, 2020  2:30 PM) An  exceptional  teacher in India is making an exceptional move: Ranjitsinh Disale, winner of the 2020 Global Teacher Prize, says he will give half of the $1 million prize to the runners-up for the award, CNN reports. That amounts to $55,000 for each of the other nine finalists.  I believe that if I share this prize money with nine teachers it means I can scale up their work,  Disale said in an interview posted by the New Indian Express.  Their incredible work is still worthy,  he said.  If I share the prize money with the rest of the teachers they will get a chance to continue their work, and we can reach out and lighten the lives of as many students as we can.  More than 12,000 teachers in some 140 countries were considered for the Global Teacher Prize this year, per the New Indian Express. Disale, a 32-year-old primary school teacher in the village of Paritewadi, was selected based on his push to promote education among girls, according to reports. He has translated textbooks into his students' tribal language and created QR codes on the books to provide better access to learning materials. Among those praising Disale's generosity is the Dali Lama, who tweeted that Disale  has set an example of compassion in action.  Among the award finalists who will benefit from Disale's largesse are teachers in Brazil, Britain, Italy, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, and the US, per CNN.",Teacher of the Year: I'm Splitting My $1M Prize,Teacher of the Year: I'm Splitting My $____M Prize,1,Copy( 1 ),0

On Thursday, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made it official: The summit of world leaders will indeed take place at Trump National Doral in June 2020, reports NPR.  We used a lot of the same criteria used by past administrations,  said Mulvaney, adding that Doral was by far the best option. And, yes, he said Trump was anticipating criticism over the decision.  We know the environment we live in,  Mulvaney said. A taste of that criticism comes up high in the Washington Post coverage of the decision, which it describes as  without precedent in modern American history: The president used his public office to direct a massive contract to himself.  Mulvaney, though, insisted that Doral will actually be  millions of dollars cheaper  than other locales.  Consider the possibility that Donald Trump’s brand is strong enough as it is,  he added.  It is the most recognizable name in the English language and probably in the world.

It could have been devastatingly expensive, in fact, except for the one thing the elite cyclist says  saved our family : an investment almost 10 years ago in a little company called Uber. Armstrong, 47, tells CNBC that his $100,000 gamble in a venture capital fund back in 2009 has paid off with a number  too good to be true,  though he's keeping quiet on the exact figure. To offer some clue as to how lucrative his asset has become: Uber was valued at $3.7 million when Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital first pumped Armstrong's money into it; now the ride-sharing company is aiming for a $120 billion valuation ahead of a possible IPO. Armstrong tells CNBC's Andrew Sorkin he didn't know at the time that Chris Sacca's Lowercase Capital was investing in Uber, thinking instead Sacca bought  a bunch of Twitter shares from employees or former employees.  When pressed by Sorkin on his windfall and whether it was perhaps  10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 million,  Armstrong simply agrees,  It's one of those,  per the BBC. Armstrong, who tells Sorkin the past six years have been  terrible  and  really sucked,  says his behavior, perhaps even more so than the doping itself, was what led to his downfall.  If I did all that [doping] but I was a gentleman ... and treated people with respect, they would've let me off,  he says.  It was the way I acted that was my undoing.

Ted Nugent has agreed to a $10,000 fine for illegally shooting and transporting a black bear in Alaska in 2009, according to a plea he signed with prosecutors there, reports the Anchorage Daily News. In addition to the fine, Nugent will produce public service messages to air on his television program, Spirit of the Wild, be banned from hunting in Alaska or on any US Forest Service land for one year, and be placed on probation for two years. The problem came on a hunting trip to Tongass National Forest in May 2009 when Nugent wounded one black bear with an arrow, then shot and killed a second bear four days later, exceeding his bear quota and making the second bear illegal. (All of it aired on TV.) Nugent's lawyer called the law  crazy  and said Nugent's arrow only  touched  the first bear, so lightly the bear did not leave a blood trail as it got away.

"(Jul 22, 2020  4:15 AM CDT) The search for a 2 1/2 year-old boy who was led away from a market in southern Mexico three weeks ago led police to a horrifying discovery: 23 abducted children being kept at a house and forced to sell trinkets in the street. Prosecutors in Chiapas state said Tuesday that most of the children were between two and 15 years old, but three babies aged between 3 and 20 months were also found during a raid Monday at the house in the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, the AP reports. San Cristobal is a picturesque, heavily Indigenous city that is popular among tourists. It is not unusual to see children and adults hawking local crafts like carvings and embroidered cloth on its narrow cobblestone streets.

"(Feb 19, 2015  12:10 PM) College football recruiting site Rivals.com is watching Tyson Thornton and Daron Bryden. Tyson, it said in a recent talent report, has  great explosiveness and surprisingly good body control for a kid his size and age,  while Daron (who once beat NFL QB Matt Hasselbeck in an accuracy contest) has  a big arm [and] is incredibly composed and very polished.  Sounds good—except the youngsters are sixth-graders and are being  actively  monitored in Rivals' database. The boys participated in a training camp for sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders, Sporting News reports, and were  so impressive  they were promoted to play against eighth-graders.  It's tough to know whether tracking 11-year-olds is the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it or whether we'll all be remembering this golden moment when the two are playing in Super Bowl 70,  Cindy Boren writes for the Washington Post. AL.com notes some of the reasons there's been pushback, such as dangers to players whose peers suddenly grow much bigger, a kid not being able to live up to expectations when he's branded a wunderkind too early, and the difficulty of predicting how a youngster will evolve as a player. Bryden's dad doesn't have an issue with it, though, telling Bleacher Report  that is exactly why they call them prospects. … Rivals is merely identifying potential future talent. This is Daron's dream and he works extremely hard at it.  But Ken Mastrole, a Florida coach who's worked with NFL QBs, tells AL.com that  you have to let the kid be a kid.

"(Jan 2, 2017  2:16 PM) At least 56 inmates died during a prison riot in the northern state of Amazonas, reports the AP, including several who were beheaded or dismembered, in the biggest killing at a Brazilian prison since 1992. Authorities said the riot apparently grew out of a fight between two of the country's biggest crime gangs over control of prisons and drug routes in northern Brazil. Amazonas state public security secretary Sergio Fontes said that some inmates escaped from the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex in Manaus, but he did not say how many. He said 40 had been recaptured. Twelve prison guards were held hostage, though all were unscathed during the riot that began Sunday afternoon and ended Monday morning.  This is the biggest prison massacre in our state's history,  Fontes said.  What happened here is another chapter of the war that narcos are waging on this country and it shows that this problem cannot be tackled only by state governments.  Fontes confirmed that many of the dead had been beheaded and Judge Luis Carlos Valois, who negotiated the end of the riot with inmates, said he saw many bodies that were quartered.  I never saw anything like that in my life. All those bodies, the blood,  Valois wrote. Two other prisons in Manaus also reported riots on Monday. In one, 87 prisoners escaped, including one that posted a picture of him on Facebook as he left. Amazonas police are investigating whether there is a link between the incidents in the three prisons. By Monday afternoon Amazonas state police said the situation had become stable in all three prisons. Fontes said the inmates made few demands to end the riot, which hints at a killing spree organized by members of a local gang, the Family of the North, against those of the First Command of the Capital that is based in Sao Paulo.","56 Killed in Gruesome Brazil Prison Riot, Some Decapitated","____ Killed in Gruesome Brazil Prison Riot, Some Decapitated",56,Copy( 56 ),0
"(Jun 25, 2019  8:31 AM CDT) A decade ago, a man calling himself Peter Bergmann checked into a hotel in Sligo, Ireland, and turned up dead on a local beach a few days later. Police are now sure the name was a fake, but they don't know much else about the man in his 60s. And as the Irish Times explains, the mystery endures because of odd details. For starters, he was seen on CCTV cameras leaving the hotel repeatedly (13 times in all) with a purple plastic bag filled with ... something. But when he returned, the bag was always empty. But he was never spotted discarding anything, or using a phone, or mailing letters despite buying 10 stamps, or doing anything that might shed light on his case.  It would be easy to see that he was ex-military or ex-police,  says a local resident.  In relations to the cameras, how he was able to go about his business without people learning anything more about him.  Bergmann, who spoke with an apparent German or Austrian accent, also scouted out a location to swim at a local beach with the help of a taxi driver, though he didn't actually swim at the time. He would return there later. Beachgoers reported seeing him walking along the shore at night, his trousers rolled up, and he was found the next morning, face down in the sand, a seeming drowning victim. Except the autopsy revealed that he didn't drown; he had a heart attack. The autopsy revealed one other telling clue—Bergmann had advanced prostate cancer. He is now buried in an unmarked grave in Sligo. Writer Rosita Boland ticks off some questions:  Why give a false name and address? Did he ever post those 10 letters, and, if so, who were they to?

But the doses of Narcan they administered couldn't save the teen. Nathan Wylie died of a suspected heroin overdose on Saturday, four days after he was taken to a Dayton, Ohio, hospital, reports the Dayton Daily News. Officials say Nathan had access to drugs because his father is an addict. Wylie had already been arrested for child endangerment after another minor who lived at Wylie's home sent a relative a photo of white powder, a razor blade, and a crack pipe in the home in Feb. 2016, police say. He was later arrested for drug possession after he was found with heroin and crack cocaine during a traffic stop in December, with Nathan in the backseat, police say, per CBS News. It isn't clear why Nathan remained at the residence. A rep for Montgomery County Children Services tells the Daily News only that there was  a case open with this family  and that Nathan's sibling was removed from the home following Nathan's death. After Nathan was taken to the hospital—a witness told officials Wylie  was on drugs and the boy got into his stuff,  per WXIX—Wylie was again arrested on suspicion of child endangerment. The 40-year-old was released in that case on Thursday. However, he remains in Montgomery County Jail in relation to the December case.

Howe suffered cardiac arrest Wednesday and died either at his Florida home or on the way to a hospital, a relative tells TMZ. The singer also suffered a heart attack in 2017. Howe replaced Paul Rodgers as Bad Company's lead vocalist after performing on Ted Nugent's 1984 album Penetrator. Also a lead songwriter, Howe made four albums with the British group—including 1990's Holy Water, which went platinum, and 1992's Here Comes Trouble, which went gold—before leaving in 1994.  It had got to the point where nobody was contributing anything to songwriting and quite frankly, the band was getting very very sloppy live,  he said, per the Independent.

"(Oct 21, 2014  8:32 AM CDT) Kate Hudson, 22, had been traveling through Europe for a while, so it didn't seem strange that she'd gained a little weight.  Any belly I had I thought was just a food baby from all the eating I’d done in Europe over two months,  the Australian woman says. But in Spain, she felt a little odd and took a pregnancy test; it came back positive, the Herald Sun reports. She figured she must have recently gotten pregnant and traveled on, but she then found out from an obstetrician in Prague in late August that she was 33 weeks along. She quickly returned home to Melbourne, only to find she was actually 38 weeks along (or possibly more, as re-testing indicated she was overdue). Days later, she had a healthy baby boy, Mason—which was a relief, considering the circumstances.  Obviously, having not known for so long, I was exercising heaps, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol, and eating anything and everything,  she says.  I had absolutely no real clear symptoms,  Hudson tells The Young Mummy blog.  I was still getting regular periods. I wasn't nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain.  (She was still a size 6 when she flew home, the Daily Mail reports.) It wasn't until just after she started her trip—since her boyfriend wasn't coming along, she went off birth control while overseas—that she stopped getting her period and started to suspect they'd gotten pregnant just before she left. Even after getting the positive pregnancy test,  I wasn't showing at all and had no symptoms,  she says. In fact, it wasn't until her flight home that she felt her baby kick for the first time. So how is this possible? Doctors told Hudson she had a tilted uterus and Mason was sitting high in her diaphragm, so it wasn't obvious that she was expecting. As WhatToExpect.com explains, a tilted or  retroverted  uterus leans backward toward your spine instead of forward toward your navel, and it can also sometimes mean that  your doctor may have trouble finding your baby with a transabdominal ultrasound  because the baby's  a bit farther away from those trying to get a peek at him.

Magdy Hegazy, a top health official in Alexandria, said that along with the 43 killed, the crash also injured 122 people, the AP reports. The Egyptian Railways Authority said earlier that a train coming from Cairo, Egypt's capital, crashed into the back of a train that was waiting at a small station in the district of Khorshid, just east of Alexandria. The stationary train had just arrived from Port Said, a Mediterranean city on the northern tip of the Suez Canal, when it was hit, according to the statement. The statement did not say what caused the accident, only that the authority's experts would investigate. AP footage from the scene showed mangled train coaches on the tracks and several others derailed as hundreds of onlookers and victims' relatives gathered around on both sides of the tracks. Ambulances were standing by and riot police and soldiers were deployed to keep the onlookers away from the scene of the disaster. Residents from nearby homes rushed to the scene to look for survivors inside crushed train carriages or offer first aid to the injured. By nightfall, cranes aided by floodlights began to remove the wreckage off the tracks to allow rail traffic to resume. Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.

But these are small achievements compared to her goal since she was 4 years old: to be the first human to set foot on Mars, CNET reports.  NASA takes people like Alyssa very seriously,  a rep tells the BBC.  She is of the perfect age to one day become an astronaut—to eventually travel to Mars,  and she's already  taking all the right steps.  Among those steps: She's traveled throughout the US and Europe attending various space programs, her website says, including Space Camp seven times and NASA's Space Academy three times. She speaks Spanish, Chinese, French, and  some Turkish,  she writes at the site, and she's an ambassador for a non-profit focused on creating a human colony on Mars, Yahoo notes. Her dad tells the BBC the family has the next 20 years planned out, and Alyssa wants to go to Mars even if it means never returning. Mars  could possibly be our next Earth,  she says.

Rick Perry, a Republican, said that the federal rules would burden Texas businesses with new commitments; instead they should be able to use the money to create jobs. While conservative groups applauded the decision, Democrats said the governor was abandoning the state's jobless for political gain. The federal stimulus money would update unemployment benefits to include more women, older Americans, and students who don't qualify for coverage under current Texas rules.  We can take care of ourselves,  Perry told Fox News, adding,  This was pretty simple for us.  But Ed Rendell, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, called Perry's decision  a terrible call.

Authorities did not immediately say if any arrests had been made. Those wounded included a male victim in critical condition with shots to the abdomen, thigh, and pelvis, along with one other male and two female victims with lesser gunshot wounds. The shooting came on the frenzied last weekend of partying before Mardi Gras. The bystander's footage showed many people in costumes, several with drinks in hand, before the shooting. Police said that two men initially were arguing with a male victim who ended up the most seriously wounded. According to police, the two suspects briefly withdrew after the initial argument, then one returned with a third man and the shooting erupted. Some revelers said that block of Bourbon Street was closed off for a time, but partying resumed in full force hours later.  It's not an OK thing that happened, and it's definitely scary.

The announcement on Monday means Ohio will go at least two years without putting anyone to death and marks another setback in efforts to carry out capital punishment in the state. The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says the dates of 12 inmates have been pushed into the future through warrants of reprieve by Gov. John Kasich. The developments mean Ohio will not execute anyone until January 2017. More than two dozen executions are scheduled nearly four years in the future, to August 2019. Ohio has run out of supplies of its previous drugs and has unsuccessfully sought new amounts, including so-far failed attempts to import chemicals from overseas.

Brittany Zamora, 28, expressed remorse in the Maricopa County courtroom, but her attorney appeared to blame the boy in a news conference after the sentencing.  I can truly say that I have been unfairly treated by the state of Arizona,  the attorney said in reading Zamora's statement.  It is shocking to me how others are so quick to judge after hearing accusations and only one side of the story.  The statement also said the boy was a teenager, not a young child, and had  many behavioral issues.  But courtroom evidence was damning. Police said Zamora and the boy had sex several times and secretly touched each other when a video was shown in her sixth-grade class at Las Brisas Academy in Goodyear, Ariz. She may have also been priming other students for sexual relationships, per the Republic. In a plea deal, Zamora pleaded guilty to sexual conduct with a minor and other charges. But the judge considered Zamora's otherwise clean record and a psychological evaluation—which found she was depressed and anxious, not sexually drawn to children—in giving her the minimum sentence. Zamora will also have to register as a sex offender and stay on probation for life, which left the boy's mother unsatisfied:  She should never have children,  she said.

It’s a troubling situation, ethics experts tell Politico, because though the law provides all those perks for five years after a speaker leaves office, it also prohibits federal money from paying for lobbying operations. In other words, Hastert can have the perks legally, as long as he doesn’t use any of them for his lobbying work.  That all needs to be above board, in the clear and transparent,  says one government watchdog,  And it’s not.

The US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio says that Elizabeth Lecron, 24, was sentenced this week to 15 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to terrorism charges in August. She had planned an attack with her boyfriend, Vincent Armstrong, on an unnamed Toledo bar, as well as purchased black powder and hundreds of screws to make bombs to destroy a Georgia pipeline. Per two USAO releases, Lecron and Armstrong started dating in mid-2018, and the two soon became  immersed  in an online extremist group called  True Crime Community,  which obsessed over mass murders  and posted extremely graphic images, videos, and sayings.  The USAO says the couple started planning the Toledo attack, which they called  D-Day ; in a June 2018 journal entry, Lecron wrote,  D-Day will be my salvation.  Lecron also became pen pals with Charleston gunman Dylann Roof, writing  numerous letters  to him in prison. In addition to the weapons, ammo, and pipe bomb materials the two purchased, they also bought clothing to wear while carrying out the attacks, investigators say. Per WTVG, Armstrong picked up a trench coat and a T-shirt that said  Society Failed Us,  while Lecron bought combat boots she thought wouldn't slip on blood and a T-shirt that said  False Prophet.  Armstrong also pleaded guilty in August to terrorism charges and will be sentenced on Dec. 10. After Lecron gets out of prison, she'll be subject to lifetime supervision, per Judge James G.

True, the legal drinking age is 21 in every state,  it writes.  But that is justified by the fact that an 18-year-old's dumb decision to drink may harm others. A decision to smoke harms only the smoker.  Besides that, says the paper, the proposal is entirely impractical: 90% of smokers take up the habit before age 18—when they have to obtain cigarettes illegally anyway—and any 18-year-old in the Bronx can just take a 20-minute bus ride to Yonkers to buy a pack. Sure, it says, the government should increase anti-smoking education and advertising, and ban where people can smoke, but  adults should retain the right to make most decisions that affect only themselves, even very bad decisions.

"(Dec 18, 2013  10:48 AM) An effort to loosen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's grip on the mortgage market will come at a price: pricier mortgages. The two announced late Monday that, at the insistence of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, they will increase their fees to borrowers without impeccable credit (designated as those with scores of 680 to 760 out of 850) or those making a down payment of less than 20%. The Wall Street Journal provides an example: And even those making a down payment of more than 20% will see the fees rise if they're in the so-so credit zone. The changes go live in March, but may start showing up earlier. The reason for the move: to make it more competitive for private investors, who  target a higher rate of return  and charge higher fees, to back mortgages. Fannie and Freddie back about two-thirds of America's mortgages, and a FHFA official says even the new rates will be lower than private ones. The Journal pairs that with some gloomy responses, such as this from Lewis Ranieri, credited with co-inventing the mortgage-backed security. He thinks the private sector isn't in a position to lend more yet, so  you're just making housing less affordable.

The fine is the largest the Federal Trade Commission has levied on a tech company, though it won't make much of a dent for a company that had nearly $56 billion in revenue last year, per the AP. As part of the agency's settlement with Facebook, Zuckerberg will have to personally certify his company's compliance with its privacy programs. The FTC said that false certifications could expose him to civil or criminal penalties. Some experts had thought the FTC might fine Zuckerberg directly or seriously limit his authority over the company. The commission opened an investigation into Facebook last year after revelations that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica had gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. The fine is well above the agency's previous record for privacy violations—$22.5 million—which it dealt to Google in 2012 for bypassing the privacy controls in Apple's Safari browser. There've been even larger fines against non-tech companies, including a $14.7 billion penalty against Volkswagen to settle allegations of cheating on emissions tests and deceiving customers.  The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC,  Joe Simons, the chairman of the FTC, said in a statement.

"(Mar 25, 2013  6:30 AM CDT) A 9-year-old girl is being hailed as both astute and brave after trekking more than a mile for help after an early-morning car crash in California yesterday. Celia Renteria was riding with her father when their SUV crashed around 1am, landing in a ravine and leaving her father unconscious, reports CBS Los Angeles; police think alcohol may have been involved. Celia climbed out the window and, smelling gas, turned off the engine. She then journeyed through the dark, rural area across a difficult landscape to find help, CNN reports. The girl saw a home some 1,000 feet away; when she arrived, no one answered the door. She returned to check on her dad before climbing up a 200-foot embankment. From there, she walked to a commuter rail station, where she hailed a passing car.  She walked quite a distance in a very, very threatening environment,  a police officer said.  It's very black out here ... It's very steep and it's brushy and there's also coyotes in the background.  CBS pegs the distance at nearly two miles. The driver who stopped called police, but when they arrived at the SUV, the girl's 35-year-old father had died.  They were really close. And that hurts me the most,  says Celia's sister.","Girl, 9, Treks Miles for Help After Crash","Girl, ____, Treks Miles for Help After Crash",9,Copy( 9 ),0
"(Aug 6, 2014  1:12 AM CDT) A Missouri inmate was put to death just after midnight for raping and killing a college student in 1995, making him the first US prisoner put to death since an Arizona lethal injection went awry last month. The Missouri Department of Corrections says Michael Worthington was executed by lethal injection at the state prison. He is the seventh Missouri inmate executed this year. Worthington had been sentenced to death for the attack on the 24-year-old woman during a burglary of her Lake St. Louis condominium. The US Supreme Court and Missouri's governor declined to block the execution yesterday. Worthington's attorneys had pressed the Supreme Court to put off his execution, citing the Arizona execution and two others that were botched in Ohio and Oklahoma, as well as the secrecy involving the drugs used during the process in Missouri. Worthington, much as he did after his arrest, insisted yesterday that he couldn't remember details of the killing and that he was prone to blackouts due to alcohol and cocaine abuse.

A 72-year-old woman found her elderly mother's body floating in the flooded basement of the older woman's Warren condo when she went to check on her, reports the AP. Police say it looks like Julia Sarno, 100, drowned after she either suffered a heart attack or perhaps fell while monitoring water levels in her basement, notes CBS Detroit. Another woman died—apparently of cardiac arrest—after she was pulled earlier this week from her water-stranded car in suburban Detroit. Monday's 4.57-inch downpour, which resulted in what Warren's mayor tells the AP  is going to go down as the great flood of 2014,  was Detroit's second-largest rainfall ever recorded in a single day—the record that stands at 4.74 inches was set in 1925, according to the National Weather Service's Detroit office.

On board: about 450 migrants who were abandoned by smugglers, leaving the cargo vessel in rough seas without a crew. An Icelandic Coast Guard ship is now towing the ship toward the southern Calabrian region, days after Italy stopped a migrant ship from crashing into the Italian coast. Children and pregnant women are among the migrants; most are believed to be Syrian, the commander says, adding the Sierra-Leone-flagged cargo ship apparently set sail from Turkey. By midday, the migrants were still hours away from land. Authorities still didn't know which port would receive the ship with its human cargo. Bad weather made the route unsure, with two ports of the Calabrian coastline in the  instep  of the Italian boot-shaped peninsula being cited as possibilities. Engineers and electricians were lowered by helicopter to the ship to get the Ezadeen steering smoothly so it could safely enter a port.

Anthony filed for bankruptcy in January; most of the debts are to Jose Baez, her defense attorney in her murder trial. But the case is not yet closed, and it's not clear how much (if any) money Anthony will have to pay, the Sentinel notes; the judge's order simply does away with Anthony's legal obligation to pay most of the debts, but could leave her still responsible for certain debts including any related to taxes, student loans, or fines in criminal cases.

Per the BBC and News.com.au, Hanna Dickenson, 24, pleaded guilty to obtaining property by deception—meaning she pretended she had terminal brain cancer and got her parents, struggling farmers, to help her beg for donations for medical treatment overseas. Those donations, a total of more than $30,000 that the London Times says came from three different sources, ended up instead funding Dickenson's party lifestyle, including foreign vacations, which one suspicious donor eventually found proof of on Facebook. One donor gave about $8,000 to Dickenson after his own cancer treatment; a couple, Nathan and Rachael Cue, says they sent her four separate donations that totaled more than $15,000. And it was the Cues' detective work that busted Dickenson's story wide open.  I started looking into it, doing my homework … and yeah, 100% scammed,  says Nathan Cue.  That's when I took it to the police.  Dickenson's lawyer's three-pronged defense included pinning her parents as the ones who actually asked people for the money, emphasizing that Dickenson has since turned her life around (she's now a real estate agent), and that her transgressions weren't as bad as those of blogger Belle Gibson, another Australian who made fake cancer claims. But Magistrate David Starvaggi called Dickenson's plot  despicable  and said it  smacks of a Walter Mitty kind of lifestyle,  adding her behavior  tears at the very heartstrings of human nature.

Noll transformed the Steelers from a long-standing joke into one of the NFL's pre-eminent powers, becoming the only coach to win four Super Bowls. He was a demanding figure who did not make close friends with his players, yet was a successful and motivating leader. The Steelers won the four Super Bowls over six seasons (1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979), an unprecedented run that made Pittsburgh one of the NFL's marquee franchises, one that breathed life into a struggling, blue-collar city.

British tourists Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, and Tom Jackson, 30, were stabbed to death at an Australian hostel in August. Police say Smail Ayad, the French national who killed them, may have been  romantically obsessed  with Ayliffe-Chung. He has no connection to the Islamic State and was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite that, the deaths of Ayliffe-Chung and Jackson were deemed terror-related by Trump. In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accuses the president of using her daughter's death to  further this insane persecution of innocent people  and  lead ignorant people into darkness and hatred.  In his own open letter, Les Jackson says Trump is purposefully lying about his son's death to  suit his agenda.  Ayliffe says that after seeing Trump's list, the police chief in charge of the investigation emailed to let her know there was still  no terror link  in the case, the Guardian reports.

Autopsies on six animals revealed fox DNA on all but one of them and noted the presence of puncture wounds; further, surveillance footage police were able to obtain in some instances showed no human culprit but did capture foxes carrying cats or parts of cats three times.

Megan Huntsman was a heavy methamphetamine user when she strangled or suffocated the newborns between 1996 and 2006, a police spokesman tells the AP. He says she wasn't concerned about potential health problems caused to the infants by her drug use—but did care about the cost of feeding her addiction.  It was completely selfish.

"(Jul 26, 2018  10:00 AM CDT) Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell calls the Karman Line the world's  most widely accepted boundary.  It's otherwise known as the point where space meets Earth's atmosphere, and since before the launch of Sputnik, it's thought to have hovered 62 miles above our heads. Until now. In a new study, McDowell argues the Karman Line is at least 20% closer, or 50 miles away, and presents some straightforward data to back that up, per Live Science. If the Karman Line really is 62 miles away, says McDowell, it should've been impossible for the Soviet Elektron-4 satellite to orbit Earth 10 times at a distance of 52 miles, as it did before disintegrating in 1997. And that's just one of 50 examples of satellites making multiple rotations of Earth at altitudes below 62 miles that McDowell uncovered while surveying the orbital paths of 43,000 satellites since 1957, reports ScienceAlert. Plugging the data into a mathematical model, McDowell found satellites tend to break from orbit 41 to 55 miles above Earth, though a fiery descent is all but guaranteed at 50 miles. This is believed to be the outer edge of the mesosphere, which extends 53 miles above Earth, according to NASA.  Adding to the evidence that this is the region where the atmosphere becomes important  is the fact that meteors, traveling faster than satellites, disintegrate in the range of 43 to 62 miles, says McDowell. If his data is correct,  you may be a little bit closer to the heavens  than you thought, per Live Science. But McDowell is considering greater implications, including what the Karman Line's positioning might mean for countries' airspace: If a US satellite flies  at 52 miles over China, for example, that could be (justifiably) construed as an act of military aggression,  he says.

White supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. is the sole defendant in the wrongful-death suit filed Aug. 30 in Charlottesville Circuit Court, which lists Heather Heyer's mother, father, and brother as beneficiaries, reports the Daily Progress. The family demands $10 million in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages in what mother Susan Bro says is an effort to keep Fields from profiting from his crimes. She's not interested in  blood money  but wants  to show others that there are serious consequences for actions of hatred and violence.   This lawsuit is a way to continue to extinguish hatred,  adds Bro, the administrator of Heyer's estate who's now working to combat fake news through the Heather Heyer Foundation, per WUSA9. Fields, serving more than two dozen life terms, has been named in a number of state and federal lawsuits filed by victims.

"(Mar 3, 2014  4:22 PM) Rescue officials say about 100 neighbors in Missoula, Montana, converged to help find three people buried Friday during an avalanche that may have been caused by a snowboarder. The avalanche swept down a mountain in a residential area of Missoula and crushed a house at the bottom.  It was very chaotic but a lot of energy,  said an assistant fire chief. Scores of neighbors had already started the rescue effort when he arrived about half an hour after the slide, and some 20 professional responders helped provide focus to the effort. An 8-year-old boy was pulled from the snow just as he arrived, he said. The three people were hospitalized a day after the avalanche slid down 4,768-foot Mount Jumbo into the northeast Missoula neighborhood. Fred Allendorf, 66, a retired professor from the University of Montana, is in serious condition while his wife, Michel Colville, is in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. The boy was expected to be released in fair condition yesterday, the Independent Record reports. Police are investigating, but Missoula avalanche expert Steve Karkanen says a snowboarder caused the accident. The snowboarder apparently came down the surface of the avalanche, helped with the rescue, and talked openly with police.

Tyshawn Lee, an elementary school student headed to his grandmother's house, was shot in the head and back Monday in a neighborhood alley on the city's South Side. McCarthy told reporters Thursday that the slaying was the result of two gangs fighting, potentially in a string of retaliatory events dating back months. He said the boy's father isn't cooperating with police. McCarthy called it probably the  most abhorrent, cowardly, unfathomable crime that I've witnessed in 35 years of policing.   Everybody is sick; everybody is disgusted,  he said. The child's father, Pierre Stokes, has disagreed with authorities' characterization of him. He hasn't talked about whether he's a gang member, but he says police have spent more time pursuing him than finding out who killed his son.  I answered every question they asked me,  he told reporters Thursday.  They're not asking me questions that I know. I don't know the questions that they asked me.

Now it's on to  the next logical step,  per the New York Times. InterContinental Hotels Group has become the first global hotel brand to say it will stop supplying miniature toiletries. The UK-based company says tiny plastic bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and other products will be pulled from its 843,000 guest rooms in more than 5,600 hotels under 17 brands by 2021. Bulk items have already replaced miniature offerings in about a third of those rooms, per the BBC, and in many other hotels around the world. IHG chief executive Keith Barr notes pressure to react to environmental issues has increased significantly, with investors interested in  going through in detail what are we doing about our carbon footprint.  IHG says it will reduce its carbon footprint by 6% per occupied room by 2020.  We collectively as an industry have to lead where governments are not necessarily giving the leadership to make a difference,  Barr says, noting IHG is also engaged in a pilot program to monitor waste from breakfast buffets. Indeed, a transition away from plastic plates and cutlery used for breakfast service at the company's hotels is  the next big thing to tackle,  along with single-use plastic bottles, Barr says, per the Financial Times. The plan is a financial win, as it costs hotels more to provide miniature toiletries than to install and service refillable dispensers, which are expected to save IHG some 200 million bathroom miniatures each year, per the AP and NY Times.

"(Mar 31, 2015  7:07 PM CDT) An 840-pound emerald is still without a clear owner after six years in police custody, but that could be settled soon in Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Michael Johnson says a case to determine the rightful owner of the 180,000-carat Bahia Emerald, found in Brazil in 2001, will move forward—despite Brazil's claims it was illegally mined, reports the Los Angeles Times. Brazil had asked the judge to dismiss the case so it could negotiate the emerald's return with the US government, but no luck. At one time, eight people claimed ownership, but several claims have been dismissed over the years. The last remaining one is led by Idaho businessman Kit Morrison, who had the gem in his possession when police traced it to a Las Vegas vault in 2009. But the history of the Bahia emerald is far more complicated than that, Bloomberg reports. The rock changed hands repeatedly before its confiscation, at one point ending up submerged in a New Orleans vault during Hurricane Katrina. It was also involved in plots with the Brazilian Mafia, along with a $197 million Bernie Madoff transaction, Fox News reports. It once went up on eBay for $75 million. Morrison finally ended up in possession, though another man—the guy who put it up on eBay, investor Larry Biegler—then called police to report it stolen, leading to its confiscation. And that's just a small sense of why it's taken six years to get this far. If Morrison is declared the owner, Brazil's hope of reclaiming the gem would be complicated, unless it's willing to pay up.  They have to pay to repatriate,  says Morrison's attorney.  You can't just take it.

That means the court now has only three solid conservatives, to four solid liberals. Of course, because both swing votes, Roberts and Anthony Kennedy, lean right, the court is still  the most conservative in nearly a century,  Bolick allows. But it means the conservative majority is suddenly fragile. Now, if Obama replaces a single conservative justice, the court will turn  sharply to the left.  Just look at the health care ruling: Roberts joined conservatives in saying that Congress couldn't penalize inaction under the Commerce Clause.

USA Today reports on a new warning from the CDC, which notes that the  fast-multiplying  Asian longhorned tick first made an appearance in August 2017 on a New Jersey sheep (one had previously been found there, in 2013 on a dog), and has since spread to at least eight other states—New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Arkansas. The ticks have dug in not just on livestock, but also on pets, animals in the wild, and humans, and they've been spotted as well in environmental samples.  We are concerned that this tick, which can cause massive infestations ... is spreading in the United States,  a CDC director notes. What makes the tick particularly concerning is that a female can shoot out up to 2,000 eggs at a time without mating help from a male—meaning one person or animal can end up as an unfortunate host to thousands of ticks. An unfed Asian longhorned tick can survive for up to a year. Health officials aren't sure whether the Asian longhorned tick can spread Lyme disease, but what it can spread is bad enough. Forbes notes those sicknesses have included a trio of  nasty  viruses, including the SFTS and Heartland viruses, as well as other disease-carrying microbes, though there've been no reports yet of any of those illnesses being transmitted in the US by the tick. Livestock in particular has been affected by this critter in Australia and New Zealand, where it's been capable of reducing dairy production by 25%.

Or so its demise was believed: The initiative—which embedded social scientists with combat units to help them avoid pointless battles and boost local aid efforts, and which cost $725 million since 2007—was apparently never shut down at all, yet the Army seemed content to let it appear as if it were, according to Army files and an anonymous DoD official. One person outraged about this development: California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the Armed Services Committee who calls the revelation  absolutely astonishing.   Even if … the program was never killed, the Army was happy with members of Congress and the scientific community thinking and believing it was killed,  he says.  The Army is evidently OK with taking people for fools.  Other issues the program was plagued by: commanders who didn't take scientist recommendations seriously and a condemnation from the American Anthropological Association. In 2015, the Army said the program had been shut down the previous year, noting there  was no longer a requirement for HTS teams in theater.  But a look at Army documents by USA Today found the focus of the program had simply changed from experts in the field to those based at Kansas' Fort Leavenworth, and it rebranded itself the Global Cultural Knowledge Network. Plus there's a paper trail showing Leavenworth officials wanted critics (including Hunter) to think the program had been killed, including a memo with instructions on how to handle  Evil People Questions  about the program.

Sometimes, he'd raid the pantry and rumple the bed sheets before setting out alone again on snowshoes with a rifle slung over his shoulder. But for most of the next decade, the man who roamed freely through the woods will live behind bars in a federal penitentiary. Knapp, 46, known by many as the  Mountain Man,  pleaded guilty yesterday to federal weapons charges and multiple state burglary charges in an agreement that will likely put him in federal prison until the end of 2024. The pleas marked the end of a mysterious story of the California fugitive, originally from Michigan, who became a sensation in Utah. For seven years, local authorities investigated cabin burglaries in southern and central Utah, before in early 2012 they identified Knapp from cabin surveillance photos and fingerprints on a Jim Beam whiskey bottle. In April 2013, he committed the crime that earned him the long federal sentence: shooting at federal agents in a helicopter when he was flushed from a home near a mountain reservoir in snowy Manti-LaSal National Forest and captured.

Knox Brewer helped reunite a woman with some stolen valuables after he fished a lockbox out of Whitney Lake, Fox reports. The boy had been hunting for metal objects underwater when his magnet attached itself to something big and a bystander helped bring it up. Knox's parents contacted police, who determined that the safe, which contained credit cards, jewelry, and a waterlogged checkbook, belonged to a woman who lived across the street from the lake. She said it had been stolen in 2012—two years before Knox was born.  She got some missing charm bracelet pieces that were still left in there,  Knox's mother says.  She said all the expensive stuff was gone but at least she got closure and some of her pieces back.   The first thing that she did was just kneel down, hug Knox, and thanked him for bringing that closure to her,  the boy's father tells WCIV.

"(Jul 2, 2019  3:37 PM CDT) President Trump's  Salute to America  4th of July bash on the National Mall will have an uninvited guest: the  baby Trump  balloon. Feminist anti-war group Code Pink was granted a National Park Service permit to display the 20-foot-tall balloon meant to look like an angry, diapered version of the POTUS, but the Park Service denied the group's request to fill the balloon with helium; it can only be filled with cold air, per CNN. The group is objecting to that decision, per Politico, insisting it will only lift the balloon two feet off the ground—well within the Park Service's 45-foot height limit—but organizers need a waiver from the FAA's Flight Standard District Office to get around it. It is attempting to get one, per a press release. Code Pink decries Trump's Independence Day event as an attempt to politicize and militarize the holiday.  You certainly can’t say that a 20-foot-tall balloon is going to interfere with Trump’s Air Force One and the Navy’s Blue Angels,  logistics manager Tighe Barry says in a statement that also takes issue with the Park Service's requirement that the balloon not be displayed within Trump's line of sight from the Lincoln Memorial, where he'll be delivering a speech.  We had requested a space on the large, empty expanse at the base of the Washington Monument that would not have obstructed anyone’s view but would have allowed the president to see the baby. Instead we were only given location options that were outside the line of sight,  the group says.

"(Oct 28, 2010  2:35 PM CDT) How much does a vote cost? Estimates vary wildly, from $5 to $175, Slate reports in its Explainer column. In 2008, winners spent an average of $1.3 million to win roughly 185,000 votes, meaning each vote cost around $7, while losers spent an average $493,000 for 91,000 votes, for an average of $5.24 per vote. But of course, some of those votes didn’t have to be bought, because many voters simply vote along party lines. The cost to sway an undecided vote is trickier to calculate. Steven Levitt (of Freakonomics fame) once estimated, using multiple races between the same opponents as guides, that each vote cost a whopping $175. A George Mason study pegged the number at around $59. But one thing is clear: Money certainly appears capable of buying votes.

The average cost of filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection is about $1,500—$300 just for the paperwork fees in court and the rest to pay for a lawyer, reports Yahoo! Finance. Bankruptcy is considered a  last financial lifeline  and without it, destitute Americans are seeing their debt snowball. The price of declaring bankruptcy has risen since the passage of the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to decrease bankruptcies by adding obstacles. The bankruptcy rate did slightly dip, but only because  the people with lower incomes can't afford to file,  said the study's co-author.

"(Mar 28, 2014  6:05 PM CDT) General Motors is boosting by 971,000 the number of small cars being recalled worldwide for a defective ignition switch, saying cars from the model years 2008-2011 may have gotten the part as a replacement. The company previously announced the recall of 1.6 million cars, only through the 2007 model year, which were built with the faulty switch. The recall involves six cars: the Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac G5, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion, and Saturn Sky. GM says it sold 95,000 faulty switches to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers for use as replacement parts. Of those, 90,000 were used to repair vehicles from the 2003-2007 model years. But 5,000 of the switches were used to fix cars from the 2008-2011 model years. GM said it doesn't know which cars got those 5,000 switches, so it needs to recall all of them. Of the cars being added to the recall, 824,000 were sold in the US. The ignition switches can move out of the  run  position and cause the car's engine to stall. It can also knock out power steering and power brakes, making the vehicle harder to maneuver, and disable the air bags. GM has said the defect is linked to at least 12 deaths in cars from the 2003-2007 models years, though a watchdog group puts the figure much higher. The company said it isn't aware of any fatalities connected to the defect in the 2008-2011 models.

Although the Office of Personnel Management is so far keeping to the original figure, briefed US officials say that 18 million people were actually affected, and that number is expected to get even bigger, CNN reports. The sources say FBI chief James Comey spilled the new estimate recently in a closed-door session with senators, though a source tells ABC News that these are  very raw numbers  and that  many forensic steps  are still being taken. Even people who applied for federal jobs and didn't get them could be at risk, per CNN. The number is expected to grow because a database was hacked that stored security clearance forms, which contained personal info of family members and associates of government officials. OPM officials are now feeling the pressure. Internal auditors told the House Oversight Committee last week that important databases with sensitive national security info hadn't been adequately protected, and the head of the OPM has been criticized for being slow to provide relevant info, CNN notes. Another sore point has been that investigators believe the hackers were the same ones that infiltrated OPM contractor KeyPoint Government Solutions last year—and that it was KeyPoint credentials used to break into the OPM files. Meanwhile, Ars Technica worries the OPM breach is related to other major hacks, and that the hackers are pulling all this info together into what will eventually become  a LinkedIn for spies, providing a foreign intelligence organization with a way to find individuals with the right job titles, the right connections, and traits that might make them more susceptible to recruitment or compromise.

The nation went to the polls to elect a parliament after last year's overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi—the first election in more than 40 years, reports al-Jazeera. It hasn't been smooth, however. Protesters trying to stop the vote have attacked polling centers and burned ballots, reports AP. Most of the unrest took place in the eastern half of the country, where residents fear the election will give too much power to the more populous west, explains the New York Times.  We will vote for the fatherland whether there is shooting or not,  one Libyan told the Times.  Whoever dies for their country is a martyr, and even if there are explosions, we are going to vote.  The 200-member parliament will appoint a prime minister and a Cabinet but will not choose a panel to write a new constitution as originally planned.

He's referring to the fatal shooting of two teenagers who asked their suspected shooter how tall he was. Victims Charles Riley, 16, and Jesean Francis, 17, were in a store buying candy when they encountered suspect Laroy Battle, 19, reports ABC News. Police say Battle is 6-3 or 6-4, and the teens commented on his height.  There was no altercation,  says Deenihan.  There was nothing that would have set off Battle to be angry at these kids. ... They literally just asked him how tall he was.  The two victims walked out of the store with a third teen, and police say Battle began following them before opening fire. The third teen escaped. Multiple security cameras picked up Battle, who was quickly identified after police made the images public. Authorities arrested him in a motel and say he had cut off his hair in an apparent attempt to alter his appearance. Battle faces two counts of first-degree murder in the June 20 killings.

"(May 4, 2017  7:21 AM CDT) Seven bounty hunters who descended on the wrong car outside a Walmart have been indicted on first-degree murder charges in the killing of an unarmed man and the wounding of another, Tennessee cops announced Wednesday. The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at four people in a Nissan sedan and chased them for seven miles. None of the men in the car was wanted on outstanding charges, the AP reports. In fact, the bounty hunters were looking for someone else, with no indication any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll says. Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, says his nephew and and his three companions thought they were being attacked by gang members and tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins says, started shooting in the Walmart parking lot and kept firing during the chase. Clarksville cops wouldn't discuss these details. The Montgomery County grand jury charged the seven men from Clarksville—William Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger West, 31; Prentice Williams, 34; and Joshua Young, 27—with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, and a slew of other charges, police say. Some of the men charged were bonding agents, others were strictly bounty hunters, per Knoll.

Now, investigators believe they know what happened to Mary Ann Perez, a 33-year-old mother of three who disappeared after meeting friends at a New Orleans-area country-western bar on March 26, 1976. As WKRG explains, just eight months after her disappearance, a set of female remains were found by hunters in Alabama's Mobile County near the Mississippi border, but in the pre-computer age, the 120 miles that separated the two cases proved too great: No one put one and one together. Four years later came a revelation, but not one big enough to solve the mystery. In 1980, a man arrested in Kansas confessed that he and his wife had killed multiple women, including one they picked up at a country-western bar, reports the Washington Post. It sounded like Perez. But there was a problem. David Courtney revealed the location of the bodies to cops, and those remains were found. All except one, that is: the New Orleans woman, whom the Advocate reports the Courtneys say they saw having car trouble. She accepted their offer for a ride, and David said he strangled her and deposited her somewhere along the Mississippi border. But no body, no crime. Things went nowhere for decades, until Det. JT Thornton of the Mobile County Sheriff’s Office started looking into cold cases, came across the Jane Doe, and then learned about Perez. He met with her family, who told her Perez had a partial dental plate due to a traffic accident—as did the remains found more than 40 years ago. Those remains are now being DNA-tested to confirm the mystery has indeed been solved.

It sounds unfathomable,  they write, but rapists can  assert their parental rights and use custody proceedings as a weapon against their victims.  At least 27 states, including Arizona, Minnesota, New York, and Mississippi, offer no protection for mothers of children conceived by rape. Some states, like Maryland and Missouri, were shocked to find no rule in the books and managed to pass laws. Other states have partial laws, like protecting the mother if her rapist is convicted.  Part of the problem is that many rapes go unprosecuted,  write Libelson and Brownstone.  Only 9 out of every 100 rapes are prosecuted and just 5 lead to a felony conviction,  according to one count.

But the key word in that sentence is  might,  notes Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune. It's still not chump change, but all Apple actually gave Cook last year was a $900,017 salary and a $14,700 contribution to his 401(K). The hundreds of millions more come from restricted stock units he was given upon promotion. Half of those shares don't vest until 2016, and the other half don't until 2021, so if Cook flames out at Apple, his 2011 payday could look pretty modest indeed. But the SEC requires companies to report share grants as compensation in the year they're given, so lots of reporters are referring to $378 million as Cook's  total compensation.

Presley—who is reportedly $16 million in debt—argues her fortune was lost because Barry Siegel failed to alert her to inappropriate spending (on expensive homes, mainly) and made a bad investment, reports TMZ. After selling 85% of Presley's shares in Elvis Presley Enterprises for $100 million in 2005, Siegel invested in Core Entertainment, the parent company of American Idol, according to Presley. When the company went bankrupt more than a decade later, Presley says she lost $24.5 million. In a countersuit, Siegel tells a very different story. The 2005 sale of Presley's shares  cleared up over $20 million in debts Lisa had incurred and netted her over $40 million cash and a multi-million dollar income stream, most of which she managed to squander in the ensuing years,  Siegel's attorney says, per the New York Daily News.

His caretakers didn't like it, because they felt it belittled his situation, explains a feature in the California Sunday Magazine. That situation, however, was short on essential details: The only thing authorities knew about the young man is that he sustained a serious head injury when a truck with immigrants from Mexico crashed on the US side of the border. He wound up in a San Diego hospital and then in a nursing home in Coronado—and he lay there for 16 years known officially as Sixty-Six Garage. Over the years, the quest to identify the silent man slowly gained steam, thanks largely to a woman—a total stranger—who learned of his fate while visiting one of her own relatives in the hospital and made it her mission to see him reunited with his family. As she spread the word, thousands of Mexican families reached out in the hope that the man might be their missing son, brother, or cousin. (Members of one family were certain of it until DNA tests proved otherwise.) Finally, the mystery was solved when the case gained so much attention that  people with power  wanted it solved, writes Brooke Jarvis.

Even on the day that Andrew Beaujon would set his eyes upon it, he had to pass through a security gate, drive a mile to its host building at Virginia's Fort Belvoir, then get inside a vault. There, he found the bust looking  less than menacing  with 70-year-old dents from boot kicks and the word  FOOL  written on the side. But opinions can change. That's part of the reason this item—one of 586 Nazi-era art pieces in Fort Belvoir's collection—is cloaked in near secrecy, Beaujon writes in a 3,500-word feature at the Washingtonian. As the curator of the collection explains,  There's a very narrow line that we have to walk because we certainly don't want it to be a rallying point for Nazism.  Neither did Gordon Gilkey, a  real-life Indiana Jones  who was instructed by the Chief Military Historian's office to seize all Nazi militaristic art in Germany after World War II, Beaujon writes. In his travels from an Austrian bar to a Bavarian castle, Gilkey uncovered 8,722 art pieces, most of which were returned to Germany after 1982 based on a historian's assessment that they were  laughable to all but the lunatic fringe.  The bust and four paintings by Hitler were among the  most heinous  pieces kept in US possession, and Beaujon notes recent neo-Nazi rallies mean the  conviction that these pieces were laughable feels a little less persuasive today,  even as the National Museum of the United States Army prepares to open at Fort Belvoir in 2019.

The incident was captured on video and posted to social media Monday, prompting outrage and causing Richfield Public Schools to apologize, KARE 11 reports.  Our nutrition staff inaccurately and inappropriately implemented alternate lunch,  the superintendent says.  There are multiple failures we had in this situation and our job is to fix it. First and foremost (in) the way we treated our kids. We should never leave kids with the feeling they had from the experience.  As many as 40 students were affected, and the district says it has personally apologized to some of them. The superintendent says students should always be allowed to keep and eat the items on their tray, regardless of lunch debt, and that students should be notified of any lunch debt issues privately, not publicly. The district released a more extensive statement on Facebook, explaining that  our nutrition services staff began implementing an existing practice that students with a meal balance of -$15 or more are provided with an alternate lunch. Unfortunately, this was not implemented in line with our guidelines or our values  and was only in place for two lunch periods and was halted by administrators before a third lunch period. The principal of the school also apologized:  One of the things we can do is model failure with grace.

A gun battle broke in out the pirate haven of Harardhere last night after a record $7 million was paid to secure the release of the Greek supertanker Maran Centaurus, its $150 million cargo, and 28 crewmembers. Local elders are trying to mediate between two sides disagreeing over how the loot should be divided, a pirate tells  Bloomberg. The fighting began even before the ransom was delivered, the AP reports. A rival gang arrived in speedboats just before the cash was dropped off, prompting the pirates holding the vessel to radio nearby anti-piracy forces for help, warning that a gunfight could ignite the crude oil onboard. Helicopters duly arrived to chase the attackers off, according to a Somali middleman involved in the negotiations—although a European naval force commander denies that they would ever intervene in a pirate fight.",Bickering Pirates Shoot Each Other Over $7M Ransom,Bickering Pirates Shoot Each Other Over $____M Ransom,7,Copy( 7 ),0

"(May 7, 2020  8:02 AM CDT) Perception is everything, and nowhere is that proving to be more true than in a recent poll on how housework and child care are being divvied up during the pandemic. Per the New York Times, the latest Morning Consult poll asked 2,200 Americans in April about these tasks, and when it came to helping kids with their homeschooling or distance learning, 45% of men with children under the age of 12 said they were the ones who did the bulk of it, not their spouse. But that's not how women are seeing it: Only 3% of those polled said their spouse is the main homeschooler, with 80% of women saying they've been assuming most of the teaching duties. The poll also found that while both men and women are having to do more domestic chores overall while in quarantine,  the crisis seems to be cementing traditional gender roles,  with women still taking on the lion's share of responsibilities around the house. The Guardian notes the domestic load for women  just got heavier,  while the Atlantic has called the stuck-at-home phenomenon  a disaster for feminism.   Grim as it is to imagine now, further epidemics are inevitable, and the temptation to argue that gender is a side issue, a distraction from the real crisis, must be resisted,  Helen Lewis wrote in March, right as lockdowns began.

His son Joseph confirmed his death after a long illness to the New York Times and Los Angeles Times. Coulombe had been the owner of a chain of convenience stores in the Los Angeles area in the mid-'60s when he became concerned about competition from 7-Eleven. Looking for his own niche, Coulombe stumbled upon some readings that indicated more people than ever were getting a college education, and that a new Boeing plane (the 747) would soon be taking flight and reducing the cost of air travel. That led Coulombe to his target demographic—well-educated, well-traveled consumers with not terribly deep pocketbooks, but who enjoyed diverse food and drink—and he opened his first Trader Joe's in 1967 in Pasadena. What also made the store stand out: its South Seas trading post theme, with friendly employees wearing Hawaiian shirts and using maritime bells to communicate on the job. Trader Joe's soon started focusing on affordable organic and natural foods, and the AP notes Coulombe also made sure to stock his shelves with wine, the most famous of which was its $1.99 Charles Shaw offering—better known as  Two-Buck Chuck.

"(Oct 1, 2012  7:46 PM CDT) American Express is paying $112.5 million in refunds and fines to settle regulators' accusations that it charged unlawful late fees and deceived customers to pressure them to pay off old debts or buy extra credit card services. The company agreed to the settlements announced today by four federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Utah regulators. American Express is refunding $85 million to about 250,000 customers and is paying $27.5 million in civil fines. The agencies said American Express violated federal laws prohibiting deceptive practices by using false statements to get customers to settle old debts. The regulators say that included falsely telling customers that if they agreed to settlements to partially pay off their debts, the remaining balance would be forgiven. The violations were said to have occurred from 2003 to this past spring.

A failure to do so  spells doom for us,  he was caught saying at a fundraiser. President Obama already appears to have a large electoral-vote lead—247 to 191—and the Hispanic vote is key to winning states that remain in play. But Obama, who leads among Hispanics by 67% to 27%, already has some big advantages: Romney has, for instance, backed Arizona's controversial immigration law and opposed the Dream Act. Meanwhile, Obama, unlike Romney and his backers, has been advertising on Spanish-language TV. In three states where Hispanics make up at least 13% of the population—New Mexico, Colorado, and Nevada—polls appear to be favoring Obama. In Florida, though Obama leads among Hispanics, Romney appears slightly ahead overall. But Romney supporters say there's time for things to change.  He hasn't begun an aggressive, national campaign for Hispanics,  a GOP strategist tells the Tampa Bay Times.  He needs to introduce himself, define himself beyond the narrow narrative coming out of the primary and at the same time go after Obama hard, both on immigration and economic failures.",Hispanics Key to 2012 Electoral Map,Hispanics Key to ____ Electoral Map,2012,Copy( 2012 ),0

Just six are straight white guys. After what the Washington Post refers to as the  sluggish pace  of President Obama's first-term appointments, the second-term candidates, named since January, illustrate his desire to diversify the federal judiciary so that it better mirrors the country it serves. The administration's push isn't entirely new: Four states already have their first female justices. In fact, the overall first-term breakdown of Obama's confirmed judges is 37% non-white and 42% women; both percentages are higher than those of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. But he's  moving quickly,  this time around, observes the Post, which expects a substantial number of candidates to be named in the coming months. But to some it sniffs of affirmative action: It's all fine and good if Obama is  achieving [diversity] through aggressive identification of minority candidates,  says a conservative Obama critic who runs a judicial advocacy group. But if the administration is giving minorities  a lower threshold of qualifications,  that's not OK, he says.

Indiana governor and now VP nominee Mike Pence will get his moment in the spotlight, where he'll need to make inroads with the American public: A CBS News poll taken July 8-12 found that 86% of voters either don't know enough about him to form an opinion or are undecided on how they feel. A trio that Trump defeated for the GOP nomination will also speak at the convention: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and (via video) Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Former VP hopeful Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, will also appear to make one of the night's final speeches. Meanwhile, Eric Trump will offer words in his role as, per USA Today, the  obligatory Trump family representative.

The report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: One base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule—and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties—and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources.

The city experienced its deadliest day of the new year on Wednesday when seven people were killed—five in a two-hour period—including a pregnant woman in her 20s. That brought the total for the year to 91 homicides as of Wednesday, according to police data, on par with the total of 93 at this time last year. The Chicago Tribune, however, uses a different metric that includes expressway shootings and police-involved shootings, and it puts the total at 99.

Don Johnson, 68, was executed via lethal injection inside a maximum-security Nashville prison for the 1984 suffocation of his wife, Connie Johnson. His last words were a long prayer that in some places echoed the words of Jesus as he was crucified, the AP reports. He asked for forgiveness for those participating in the execution, saying  they know not what they do.  Johnson, who killed his wife by stuffing a trash bag down her throat, also prayed for  all those I have hurt  and thanked God for God's blessings, including his attorneys and loved ones. After the lethal injection drugs began flowing, Johnson asked if he could sing. Given permission by the warden, he sang  They'll Know We Are Christians  and then  Soon and Very Soon.  His voice trailed off in the middle of the second song after the words,  no more dying there.  He then began making noises that some witnesses interpreted as snores and others said were more like gurgling and gasping. They lasted about three minutes. After the execution, one of his attorneys, Kelley Henry, said she believes the noises were an indication that he could feel pain. After the execution, a Department of Correction spokeswoman read a statement from Connie Johnson's sister, Margaret Davis.

The FBI in late October ponied up $25,000 for anyone providing information leading to the 13-year-old Wisconsin girl's rescue, and the Jennie-O Turkey Store, which employed her parents, matched that amount.

Researchers at the Healthy Babies Bright Futures Foundation say arsenic, lead, mercury, or cadmium were found in almost all of the 168 baby foods from US manufacturers it tested. The researchers say the neurotoxic metals are harming young brains, slowing down development, and causing attention deficit disorders and lower IQs.

Everything we can do to drop the levels of these chemicals that kids are exposed to just gives them a better chance of learning.  Lead, found in 95% of baby foods tested, was the most prevalent heavy metal. The researchers say foods made with rice—especially brown rice—were the most contaminated, especially with arsenic. They also recommend cutting back on fruit juices and on carrots and sweet potatoes, since root crops tend to absorb heavy metals.  Best first foods for infants are avocado, pureed veggies, peanut-butter oatmeal, and salmon,  pediatrician Tanya Altmann tells CNN.  They all provide important nutrients that babies need, help develop their taste buds to prefer healthy food and may decrease food allergies.  Brody says the FDA needs to do more on the issue, since 90% of the foods involved in the study had no standards set for the maximum safe limit of heavy metals.",Toxic Metals Found in 95% of Baby Foods,Toxic Metals Found in ____% of Baby Foods,95,Copy( 95 ),0

"(Jan 2, 2017  4:53 AM) One of the most violent years in Chicago history ended with a sobering tally: 762 homicides, the most in two decades in the city and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents last year than it did in 2015, according to data released Sunday by the Chicago Police Department. The statistics underline a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers are staggering, even for those who followed the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings, the AP reports. The increase in homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference Sunday that anger at police, including in the wake of video released that showed a white Chicago officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, has left criminals  emboldened  to violent crimes. He also said it's becoming clearer to criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system.  In Chicago, we just don't have a deterrent to pick up a gun,  he said.  Any time a guy stealing a loaf of bread spends more time pre-trial in jail than a gun offender, something is wrong.","Chicago's 2016 Murders: More Than NY, LA Combined","Chicago's ____ Murders: More Than NY, LA Combined",2016,Copy( 2016 ),0

The NBA star says the club, WiP, should have known that allowing Brown and Drake—who've both been involved with Rihanna—in at the same time was a terrible idea. Thus, the lawsuit claims, the club owners are responsible for the injuries he suffered in the fight. Those injuries include a  corneal laceration of the left eye,  the lawsuit claims, and Parker's lawyer notes that eye injuries  certainly don't improve your outside shot.  The lawyer also, amusingly, says of Rihanna:  She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble.

Their mom, Laura, said on the day in question she had them in view. But just five minutes later, Andie approached her, drenched.  Andie walked up and was like, 'I falled in the pool!

Per Today, Forrester told WBIR that her family moved into their home right around the time Olympic skier Bode Miller's young daughter drowned in a pool, and  it was heavy on my mind and heavy on my heart.  She says they pulled out all the stops to ensure the kids would be safe around their own pool, including erecting a safety fence, rigging the doors around the house so they'd beep when opened, and giving the kids instructions to never go outside without an adult or babysitter.

Fairow—who replaced resigning police chief Sean Whent on Friday amid an investigation into possible underage sex and murder—was removed from his post Wednesday after just six days, reports the Los Angeles Times. During a background check, Mayor Libby Schaaf says she received information that  raised concerns for me about whether [Fairow] can effectively lead this department at this particular moment in time.  She didn't elaborate, but the chief of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department—where Fairow previously served and will return—says Fairow told him he had an affair with a consenting adult while married more than a decade ago, per the AP. Fairow worked for the Oakland Police Department at that time. Sources tell the East Bay Times that the other party was an employee, though a BART rep denies that. While an officer's suicide note first suggested that four Oakland officers were involved with an underage prostitute, the woman now claims she had sexual contact with some two dozen officers from various agencies in exchange for protection or knowledge of prostitution stings in the works, including while she was underage; she is now 18. A Contra Costa County Sheriff's deputy has been suspended, two Oakland officers have resigned, and three are on administrative leave.

She was apparently able to call 911 to tell police what kind of car he was driving, and where he was headed next, reports the Chronicle. That destination, per Fox News: her grandparents' home. Authorities were then able to box him into a cul-de-sac roughly three miles from the shooting scene. After hours of waiting and negotiations, the man emerged from his car, raised his hands, and sank to his knees as deputies placed him under arrest. Fox News and CNN have identified the shooter as 34-year-old Ron Lee Haskell, but CNN now clarifies, by way of Constable Ron Hickman, that Haskell was not the children's father. Hickman says one of the home's residents is thought to be related to the woman Haskell had been married to.  It appears this stems from a domestic issue with a breakup in the family from what our witness has told us,  a police spokesman told reporters.

"(Sep 10, 2017  5:36 AM CDT) Hurricane Irma regained strength as it closed in on the Florida Keys early Sunday and forecasters monitored a crucial shift in its trajectory—just a few miles to the west—that could keep its ferocious eye off the southwest Florida coast and over warm Gulf water. The hurricane re-strengthened to Category 4 with maximum sustained winds near 130mph, reports the AP. The National Hurricane Center said Irma was expected to weaken but would remain a powerful storm as it moved through the Florida Keys and near the state's west coast. As of 5am EDT Sunday, the hurricane was centered about 40 miles south-southeast of Key West, and had sped up slightly, moving northwest at 8mph. Tens of thousands huddling in shelters watched for updates as the storm swung west, now potentially sparing Tampa as well Miami the catastrophic head-on blow forecasters had warned of for days. But those few miles meant St. Petersburg could get a direct hit, rather than its more populous twin across Tampa Bay. Neither city has suffered a major hurricane in nearly a century. The leading edge of the storm bent palm trees and spit rain across South Florida, knocking out power to more than 170,000 homes and businesses, as the eye approached Key West. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents in evacuation zones Saturday that  this is your last chance to make a good decision.  About 6.4 million were told to flee. Forecasters said the greater Miami area of 6 million people could still get life-threatening hurricane winds and storm surge of 4 to 6 feet. Irma's course change caught many off guard and triggered a major round of last-minute evacuations in the Tampa area. Many businesses had yet to protect windows with plywood or hurricane shutters.","Irma Regains Category 4, Bears Down on South Fla.","Irma Regains Category ____, Bears Down on South Fla.",4,Copy( 4 ),0
"(Feb 21, 2014  8:15 AM) Colorado and Utah are taking a page from Michael Bloomberg's book: Both states have moved to raise the smoking age to 21, following a similar bill passed in New York City last fall. The proposals were given the initial go-ahead yesterday, and though more votes are needed, this is the furthest any state has gone to rein in teen access to cigarettes, the AP notes. Utah—with the nation's lowest smoking rate at 12% as of 2011—is already one of only four states that require tobacco purchasers to be 19. The smoking rate is low in Colorado, too, at about 18%, but health advocates only want to see it fall.  What I'm hoping to do is make it harder for kids to obtain cigarettes,  says Colorado Rep. Cheri Gerou, while a Utah woman adds,  By raising the age limit, it puts them in a situation where they're not going to pick it up until a much later age.

She and her manager were speaking Hindi at the time, and Ram thought the manager agreed. She took a fish sandwich, fries, and a drink with her—and when she came back to work three days later, she was fired over it. Now Ram, who supported a husband with physical disabilities and an adult daughter with mental disabilities with the minimum-wage job, has been vindicated: A Supreme Court judge in British Columbia awarded her approximately $35,000 in lost wages and damages, the CBC reports. The judge noted that it was clear Ram hadn't planned to steal, made no attempt to hide what she'd done, and had no history of discipline at her job. The judge also wrote that firing wasn't a proportionate punishment, given Ram's long work history and  her economic vulnerability as a 55-year-old woman with little education.

He also offers a cryptic warning to those he says are trying to  sensationalize  the couple's split.

"(Sep 15, 2017  10:21 AM CDT) A phalanx of police and a campus on virtual lockdown Thursday accomplished the University of California, Berkeley, administration's goal of allowing a conservative to speak at the famously liberal university, one that has become known more recently for its violent demonstrations between those with opposing viewpoints. Outside, hundreds of protesters were also allowed to voice their displeasure over the speech by former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro, chanting  no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.  Others held signs objecting to the university hosting Shapiro, the AP reports.  For the most part it was an orderly event,  UC Police Chief Margo Bennett said.  The crowd in the street was loud, but not violent.  Berkeley police tweeted that nine people had been arrested.  We had a successful event tonight,  UC spokesman Dan Mogulof said, adding that the university is committed to hosting speakers like Shapiro in the future. Streets were closed and concrete barriers were erected in what many saw as the latest polarizing event to raise concerns about violence in the city. Xochitl Johnson, an organizer with Refuse Fascism, a group protesting Shapiro's speech, attacked the university for deploying police for what she said was the creation of a safe space for fascists. She said it was wrong for the school to shut down the campus to let him speak. Shapiro was invited to speak by campus Republicans, who say the liberal university stifles the voice of conservative speakers. UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof estimated security costs could hit $600,000 for the event.",9 Arrests as Conservative Firebrand Speaks at Berkeley,____ Arrests as Conservative Firebrand Speaks at Berkeley,9,Trans( nine ),1

But in a confusing twist, Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al-Qosi will probably serve far less time because of a secret plea bargain he struck last month, reports Reuters. (It's so secret that the tribunal was not informed that the deal limited his jail time.) His actual sentence won't be revealed for several weeks while the Pentagon reviews it, notes AP. Al-Qosi, the fourth Guantanamo detainee convicted since the prison opened in 2002, admitted that he followed bin Laden out of Sudan in 1996 and continued working for him in Afghanistan.

Trading on shares of the company was halted today when the company made it known that it had a major announcement coming. The announcement: It had signed a letter of intent to be purchased by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. for $4.7 billion, or $9 a share, the  Wall Street Journal reports. Shares had been down 5.6% before trading halted, to $8.23, in the wake of Friday's news that the company would cut its staff by 40% and stop selling devices to consumers.

As part of the Robin Williams Trust, Williams bequeathed the legal rights to his name, image, likeness, and signature to a charitable foundation his own legal reps had set up. The Trust decrees that Williams'  right of publicity  won't be exploited for 25 years after his death, meaning that the first time you might see an authorized ad featuring the comedian is 2039. It also means you won't be seeing, at least not immediately, a holographic Williams' stand-up routine a la Michael Jackson or Tupac.

The Laysan albatross, who lives in the Pacific Ocean's Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and was tagged by scientists in 1956, is already more than twice the age an average Laysan albatross reaches. And scientists previously believed that most albatross females lose their fertility later in life, as other birds do. Wisdom, however, could cause them to change their theories, the Washington Post reports. She's raised as many as 35 chicks in her life, five of them from 2006 on. Since she was tagged, she's estimated to have flown an incredible 3 million miles, or  four to six trips from the Earth to the Moon and back again with plenty of miles to spare,  according to a US Geological Survey statement.

In return for the $20 billion in extra cash and a federal commitment to absorb 90% of the bank's losses over a certain level, BofA agreed to give stock to the Treasury. The deal specified that if BofA wanted out, it would have to pay an  appropriate fee —and the Treasury and Fed now say they want as much as $500 million, if not more.

Seven board members, including author Suzy Welch, stepped down immediately after the board voted to keep Pacelle, the Washington Post reports. The meeting came after an outside law firm hired to investigate allegations against the longtime CEO identified three complaints of sexual harassment. The law firm also found that the Humane Society offered settlements to three workers who said they were fired or demoted after complaining about Pacelle's behavior. Board member Erika Brunson tells the New York Times that she believes Pacelle did nothing wrong.  The CEO stays, and rightfully so,  she says.  We're not an association that investigates sexual harassment. We raise funds for animals.  The 83-year-old adds:  Which red-blooded male hasn't sexually harassed somebody?  Rachel Perman, a director of the Tofurky food company, says that after she emailed board members in November with concerns about Pacelle, Brunson said she was  out of her mind  and accused her of  airing her repressed sexual fantasies.

"(Jul 10, 2015  2:35 PM CDT) HBO chief Richard Plepler said earlier this year that people swiping HBO Go passwords from family or friends to watch their favorite shows and movies was not a big deal, but he may want to rethink that business concession. A new report by Parks Associates and cited by Consumerist shows that 6% of US households are using someone else's account to watch a streaming-video service (think HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime)—and that programming pilfering will cost the industry $500 million this year. Young adults ages 18-24 use OTT (over-the-top) video services paid for by someone else the most, with 20% copping to it, per The Cost of Piracy report. Those numbers keep dropping (e.g., only 10% of the 25-34 set admit to this activity), until they rise slightly in the 55-64 demographic, which Consumerist notes could be from older parents using their adult children's accounts.  Credential sharing has a measurable impact on video services,  a Parks Associates analyst says in the release.  The impact on OTT video revenues is especially troublesome as OTT providers are investing large sums of money to boost their original content offerings.  The company notes that a previous study of college students found little guilt or embarrassment present when using a  borrowed  password. Consumerist notes that while Netflix makes it relatively easy for different people to use the same password (its highest-level service plan allows for content to be streamed on four screens at once), other services like Hulu limit streaming to one device at a time, which limits the hit the service takes.

And that second set of problems is something we need to be concerned with, say researchers involved in a new study that found an estimated 10.6% of people over age 65 reported binge drinking in the prior 30 days. That's defined as five or more drinks in one sitting for men, or four or more for women. As lead study author Dr. Benjamin Han explains to NBC News, a person's body becomes more sensitive to alcohol the older they get.  They still think they can drink the same way, but the risks increase quite a bit,  he says. Researchers say more studies are needed, but rates of binge drinking among older adults may be rising; Time notes the rate of binge drinking among older adults was 7% in 2006. Binge drinking can make certain chronic health issues, including hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes, worse, and may put people at risk for other chronic conditions including cancer, dementia, and liver disease. It can also cause people to forget to take medications and can put them at risk for falls. The fall risk is increased if they are also using cannabis, and the study found cannabis use was higher among subjects who reported binge drinking—not to mention the fact that falls are the leading cause of broken bones, trauma, and deaths among older adults even when alcohol and cannabis use are not considered. The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, analyzed data on nearly 11,000 people over age 65 who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2015 and 2017.

Amazon argues that not only would handing over the recordings possibly give the government unconstitutional access to the user's consumption of books, music, and other content, but that Alexa's responses are an extension of Amazon's protected speech. A law professor says Amazon has a  surprisingly  good case as long as Alexa is viewed as an extension of the company. Amazon says police are just hoping to find something in the recordings and must prove they're necessary to the case, Ars Technica reports. According to TechCrunch, Amazon worries about the precedent this case could set having a chilling effect as virtual assistants like Alexa continue to gain in popularity.",Amazon Defends Alexa's 1st Amendment Rights in Murder Case,Amazon Defends Alexa's ____st Amendment Rights in Murder Case,1,Trans( First ),1

You're in luck: Fererro USA, which makes the creamy spread, has set aside $3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit from a California mom. Athena Hohenberg filed the suit in reaction to Nutella's advertising claim that the product is  an example of a tasty yet balanced breakfast  (when combined with other, healthy products, like milk, OJ, and whole wheat bread). Hohenberg  was surprised and upset to learn that Nutella was in fact not a 'healthy, nutritious' food but instead a product with the nutritional properties of a candy bar,  according to her lawsuit.

"(Oct 21, 2015  2:44 PM CDT) Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said Wednesday he is creating a $150 million super PAC focused on revising corporate tax law. Icahn will use his super PAC to press Congress to pass legislation that stops US companies from moving their profits overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates — a practice known as  inversions.  American corporations—including Apple, one of his own biggest investments—are holding more than $2.2 trillion abroad, Icahn said. The investor laid out his plans in a letter posted on his website, which he said he also delivered to lawmakers. He said in a CNBC interview Wednesday that he's taking action because he's tired of Congress dodging the issue.  These guys are unwilling to compromise,  he said of lawmakers.  They have to be held accountable.  Icahn said he will seek super PAC donations from others but noted in his letter that his own $150 million should be  more than enough to make voters fully aware of the horrible consequences  of inversions. He said it would take  a simple law  to address inversions and  It's ridiculous not to do it.  Icahn joins other billionaires, including environmentalist Tom Steyer and gun-control advocate Michael Bloomberg, in using super PACs to tackle a single policy issue. Those two have spent tens of millions of dollars in recent elections boosting politicians who agree with their viewpoints on those topics and criticizing those who don't.

The Chinese-made Y-8 turboprop aircraft disappeared Wednesday afternoon about a half-hour after leaving Myeik, also known as Mergui, for Yangon on a route that would have taken it over the Andaman Sea, the AP reports. It was raining, but not heavily, at the time. Nine naval ships, five army aircraft, and three helicopters were searching for the plane Thursday morning, a military spokesman says. Gen. Myat Min Oo says the ship found two life jackets, three bodies, and a tire that was part of an aircraft wheel. The bodies were of a man, a woman, and a child. The plane carried 106 passengers—mostly families of military personnel—and 14 crew members. Fifteen of the passengers were children. It is not unusual for such flights to carry civilians to offset transportation costs for military families stationed in the country's remote south. The military says Myanmar received the Y-8 plane in March of last year, and since then it had logged 809 flying hours. The BBC reports there was no mayday call from the aircraft and while the cause of what is believed to be one of the deadliest plane crashes in Myanmar's history is still unclear, the dispersed debris suggests the plane broke up in mid-air.",Bodies Found After Plane Vanishes With 120 Aboard,Bodies Found After Plane Vanishes With ____ Aboard,120,Copy( 120 ),0

"(Oct 25, 2016  3:49 PM CDT) Former congressman Gary Condit is speaking out publicly for the first time in 15 years over Chandra Levy's murder in 2001. Levy was an intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in DC when she vanished while jogging, and her remains were found in a park. Investigators at the time say Condit admitted that he'd had an affair with the 24-year-old, but he has never publicly acknowledged that. Now, the 68-year-old has co-written a book about the case, Actual Malice, and in an interview about it with Dr. Phil McGraw, he insists he was not romantically involved with Levy and had nothing to do with her killing, ABC News reports. He says police tried to  frame  him. Condit's political career imploded after Levy's murder, though he was ruled out as a suspect early on in the investigation, People notes.  I saw her one time outside the office, at a restaurant, and she came by my condo once,  Condit says.  Well, maybe twice. Yeah, I think it was twice she came by. I want to make this clear: There’s nothing unusual about someone coming by my condo, a lot of people did.  Levy's mother, Susan, tells ABC that she doesn't believe he's telling the whole story.  Chandra was secretive about her relationship with Condit,  she says.  Chandra shared that her 'Man,' as she called him, was high-profile and it was best to not be seen together.  A review of the book at the Modesto Bee notes that it is critical of the Levy family, along with police and the media.

"(Sep 15, 2015  4:50 AM CDT) If you're between 50 and 70 years old and you're not already taking a low dose of aspirin, it's something you should consider, according to a federal panel. Aspirin is already recommended for people with a history of heart trouble, and the US Preventive Services Task Force now says a daily dose will help prevent people at risk from developing heart problems, as well as help cut their risk of colorectal cancer, reports the New York Times. The panel defined people at risk as those 50 to 69 with more than a 10% risk of a heart attack in the next 10 years, which can be calculated here. Long-term use of aspirin can, however, trigger potentially fatal bleeding in the stomach or the brain, and the nation's health experts are fiercely debating the wisdom of the task force's advice. The FDA said last year that it doesn't believe evidence supports the use of aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic tells the Washington Post. He says it's an  incredible paradox  that two arms of government are giving conflicting advice—and he sides with the FDA. Meanwhile, the chief of cardiology at Georgetown University tells NBC News that he hopes the advice will at least make more people aware of the benefits and risks of aspirin, helping the right people to start taking it and the wrong people, including those at higher risk of bleeding, to stop.

In what Politico is calling a  preemptive strike,  a number of groups—many aligned with Bernie Sanders—are trying to render the potential  major asset  (he's young, Latino, was San Antonio's mayor) unusable. It's the 41-year-old's current gig, as Housing and Urban Development secretary, that's at the root of the attack, which targets mortgage sales. The allegations, per the groups' DontSellOurHomesToWallStreet.org site:  HUD promised to help homeowners avoid foreclosure by selling more overdue mortgage loans to nonprofit community organizations rather than Wall Street banks.   But,  they continue,  in reality HUD’s two most recent sales have sent 98% of the mortgages straight to Wall Street—and at a HUGE discount, almost half off!  HUD disputes the figure. Politico explains that the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program has since 2010 let mortgages that are barreling toward foreclosure be sold to  qualified bidders  whose goal is supposed to be to get the loans back in good standing. Under Castro, progressives feel it's basically been  a fire sale for Wall Street firms,  in Politico's words.

However, it provided no explanation for why he allegedly maneuvered around a vehicle barrier early Saturday evening and plowed into tourists and vendors on the popular walkway along the Pacific. Italian newlywed Alice Gruppioni, 32, who was on her honeymoon, was killed, and 16 other people were injured. Campbell was charged with one count of murder, 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and 17 counts of hit-and-run. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Bail was set at $1.48 million.

I might expect to see a 25-pound ovarian tumor, but a 132-pound tumor is very rare,  says Dr. Vaagn Andikyan of Danbury Hospital, where the operation took place on Feb. 14. His patient, a 38-year-old woman, had experienced sudden weight gain of about 10 pounds per week for two months and went to her OB/GYN, per Live Science. A CT scan then revealed a noncancerous tumor growing on her left ovary. Because the  mucinous  mass grew to sit on her digestive tract, the 350-pound patient was  extremely malnourished  ahead of surgery and  used a wheelchair because of the tumor's weight,  Andikyan says. The tumor itself was  gigantic,  pushing up against blood vessels and putting the woman at risk of potentially fatal blood clots, doctors tell CNN.  She was so hopeless, because she had seen several other doctors, and they were unable to help her,  Andikyan adds. The woman is now recovering well and back to work as a teacher after doctors removed the mass, her left ovary, left fallopian tube, and excess skin stretched by the tumor (see a pre-surgery image here). Reconstructive surgery was also required as the abdominal wall had been pushed out by the tumor. Describing the mass as one of the 10 biggest ever removed from a patient, Andikyan notes  we are doing genetic testing on it to determine if there is any mutation that caused it to grow as large as it was,  per WCVB.

Rebel-held Daraya has witnessed some of the worst bombardment during the country's civil war, now in its sixth year. The food delivery (which SARC said also included flour and medical supplies) late Thursday night came a week after a joint convoy of the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and SARC reached Daraya and delivered medicines, vaccines, baby formula, and  nutritional items for children —but no food. The UN estimates there are currently 592,700 people living under siege in Syria (with the vast majority of them besieged by government forces) and 4,000 to 8,000 people living in Daraya, which has been subject to a crippling government blockade since residents expelled security forces in the early stages of the uprising against President Bashar Assad. An official with the UN's World Food Programme said in a video posted online by media activists that WFP had delivered about 480 food rations that would feed about 2,400 individuals for one month.

"(Aug 6, 2015  4:19 PM CDT) A Colorado resident died of the plague Tuesday, likely after being infected by fleas from a dead animal. The unidentified adult becomes the second person to die from the infamous disease this year. A 16-year-old star baseball player died of the plague in June. Both victims likely had a rare septicemic form of the plague, which is hard to diagnose because it doesn't include the typical swelling of lymph nodes seen in most plague cases. Cases of the plague are rare in the United States, and deaths are even rarer. On average, seven human plague cases are reported in the United States every year, but Colorado had eight plague cases of its own last year. Officials are attributing that to a boom in the animal population. In septicemic plague, the bacteria enters the blood stream and creates flu-like symptoms. The most common type of plague is the well-known bubonic. All types of plague can be treated but are deadly when that treatment is delayed.",Colorado Already Has 2 Plague Deaths This Summer,Colorado Already Has ____ Plague Deaths This Summer,2,Trans( second ),1
"(Mar 6, 2020  8:34 AM) Last summer came headline after headline about someone taking a carton of Blue Bell ice cream out of supermarket freezers, licking the ice cream contained therein, then putting the carton back on store shelves. A punishment has been handed down over one of those stunts: D'Adrien Anderson was sentenced Thursday to 30 days in jail for letting his tongue touch dairy goodness in a Port Arthur Walmart, NBC News reports. The video of the 24-year-old doing so went viral after originally being posted online in August, and he was soon busted and pleaded guilty to criminal mischief in January. Authorities concede that Anderson went back and purchased the licked carton, but they say it doesn't matter, as Walmart had to toss all of its ice cream.  Anderson's actions caused public concerns about the safety and quality of consumer products offered for public consumption, impacted Blue Bell consumer confidence, and caused the company financial loss,  the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office said. In addition to the 30-day jail sentence, notes KBMT, Anderson will receive 180 days of probation; be required to put in 100 hours of community service; and have to pay a $1,000 fine, plus just north of $1,500 in restitution to Blue Bell.

Retrofitted with modern electronics, the U2 and its pilot can monitor the battlefield, provide crucial communications to troops on the ground, and even intercept enemy communications. But some of the plane’s old-fangled tech still provides a big reward. The U2, which first flew in 1955, still carries its powerful film cameras, which provide such high resolution that Marines used photos to detect and neutralize 150 possible below-ground IEDs ahead of the recent assault on Marjah. Health risks to pilots, who don space suits to fly 9- to 12-hour sorties at 70,000 feet, and a new generation of drones could soon make the plane obsolete.

"(Jul 2, 2014  2:27 PM CDT) The parents of a severely autistic boy have been arrested after investigators determined the 11-year-old had been kept in a large metal cage, possibly to control his violent outbursts, authorities said today. The cage—similar to an extra-large dog kennel—was found in the Orange County, California, home with a mattress and other bedding inside. It was roughly 6 feet tall, 5 feet long, and 3 or 4 feet wide with room to stand. The boy was not inside when police arrived, but family members gave varying accounts of how long he had been kept in it, ranging from hours to days.  It appeared that as he grew older his episodes of violence and outbursts were increasing and perhaps the parents utilized the cage as a tool to modify that and to contain him when that was happening,  a police lieutenant said.  Obviously, putting your child in a locked cage, even if you're desperate for help, is not the best course of action.  Officers arrested the couple last night on suspicion of felony child endangerment and false imprisonment, after an anonymous tipster called child protective services. The child was well-nourished and appeared otherwise healthy and his two siblings, ages 8 and 10, were also unharmed. They were all placed in protective custody.","Police: Autistic Boy, 11, Kept in Cage","Police: Autistic Boy, ____, Kept in Cage",11,Copy( 11 ),0

The US ski team said Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, died in the incident near the Rettenbach glacier near Soelden, the venue for the annual season-opening World Cup races. Berlack, from Franconia, NH, and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers descending from the 3,056-meter Gaislachkogel when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four escaped unhurt. Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures.  Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport—both on the race course and skiing the mountain,  US Ski and Snowboard Association President Tiger Shaw said.  Both of them loved what they did.  Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers following two top-20 finishes at the 2013 US national championships and a spring tryout camp. Astle was invited to train with the development team this season after strong early season results, including two top-10 results at NorAm Cup races last month in Canada. Berlack and Astle were part of a group of 10 skiers on the development team who gained experience in the Europa Cup and were preparing to race on the top-level World Cup.

"(Nov 11, 2008  10:07 AM) Ninety years ago today the Allies and Germany signed the armistice that ended World War I, a conflict of unprecedented brutality and expense. But where today Americans celebrate Veterans Day, a commemoration of wars' survivors, in Europe the mood is  altogether more somber,  historian Alexander Watson writes in the New York Times. In Britain and France especially, today—Armistice Day—is a day for the dead. In Britain, tens of millions of citizens wear red paper poppies to commemorate the 700,000 men who died in the trenches. In France, which lost 1.4 million, mayors read out the names of the fallen while military bands play the national anthem. Ninety years on, writes Watson, Armistice Day reminds us that we still need ritual and remembrance to understand the horrors of  the war to end all wars.","90 Years On, It's Still the War to End All Wars","____ Years On, It's Still the War to End All Wars",90,Trans( Ninety ),1
"(Jun 14, 2016  5:35 PM CDT) When the staff at London's highbrow Southbank International school heard former teacher William Vahey had died of a heart attack, tears were shed. The reality was infinitely darker: Vahey took his own life with a stab wound to the chest in the bathtub of a Minnesota Quality Inn on March 21, 2014. The next month, the FBI revealed the married father of two sons was believed to be one of the most prolific pedophiles it had ever dealt with, one who was able to drug and abuse male pupils at international schools in eight countries over his 42-year career with impunity. Now, the Guardian's five-month investigation into the case reveals  evidence that, if properly explored,  could have stopped Vahey, convicted as a pedophile in the US at age 20—something all the background checks missed. At schools in places like Indonesia he would lead the travel club, taking students to far-flung locations where invariably some of the boys would fall sick—drugged by Vahey; he would insist on watching over them, in his room or theirs. A fellow chaperone recalls being likely drugged and how insistent Vahey was that no one touch his camera. A man who at age 14 had sleepovers with Vahey's sons at their Jakarta home recalls being given drug-laced Oreos and the  eating race  Vahey would suggest to get the boys to gobble them down. His parents went to an administrator who now denies being told about the cookies specifically. The Guardian suggests Vahey's wife's prominent position within the international schools community may have made some hesitant to speak up about their suspicions for fear of damage to their careers. Things only began to unravel when Vahey's maid stole his flashdrive, which held photos of naked and partially clad boys—some 90 of them—and turned it over to the American Nicaraguan School in November 2013.

"(Jul 11, 2017  6:47 AM CDT) Another person has died as a result of an exploding Takata airbag, though in this case the car involved wasn't even in a crash. Honda says it recently learned about an incident on June 18, 2016, in which a man was using a hammer to make repairs on a 2001 Honda Accord when the airbag inflator activated and ruptured, sending metal fragments flying. Ramon V. Kuffo, 88, who did not own the vehicle but had taken apart the center console with the ignition switch on, died of head trauma a day after a neighbor found him bleeding from the face in the passenger seat of the car parked in his yard near Miami, Fla., reports the Detroit News. The airbag had deployed and  the rupture most likely contributed to his death,  says a Honda rep. Kuffo's death is the 12th in the US and 17th worldwide to be blamed on the faulty inflators, which have injured 180 in the US. Honda—which only learned of the incident with a legal claim in March, per the New York Times—notes the Accord had one of Takata's most dangerous inflators with a reported 50% chance of it rupturing in a crash. But though owners of the car were sent 12 recall notices over seven years,  our records indicate that the recall repair was never completed,  Honda says. Almost 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles have now been recalled due to the faulty inflators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says  it's essential to safety that high-risk inflators are replaced immediately.

Seven had committed drug-related crimes; the rest had convictions related to murder and robbery.

It is with tremendous sadness that I announce the passing of my mother, Patricia Sue Head Summitt,  her son, 25-year-old Tyler Summitt, announced on the Pat Summitt Foundation website.

I ain't fit to live, not after what I done,  a handcuffed Willie Corey Godbolt, 35, told the Clarion-Ledger. The shootings took place at three homes Saturday night—two in Brookhaven and one in Bogue Chitto—about 70 miles south of Jackson, after authorities got a call about a domestic dispute, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said. The dead included two boys, investigators said. Godbolt was listed in good condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound; authorities did not say how he was wounded. Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said charges had yet to be filed and it was too soon to say what the motive was. Authorities gave no details on the relationship between Godbolt and the victims. However, Godbolt himself shed some light on what happened in a video interview with the newspaper as he sat with his hands cuffed behind his back on the side of a road. Godbolt said he was talking with his wife and in-laws when somebody called authorities.  I was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama and her, my wife, about me taking my children home,  he said.  Somebody called the officer, people that didn't even live at the house. That's what they do. They intervene.   They cost him his life,  he said, apparently referring to the deputy.  I'm sorry.

But she relapsed the following year ( When I was 13, that was probably the lowest  point in her life, she says), leading to 18 more months in a hospital.  [My parents] were pretty out there,  Barrymore says.  But I realized, honestly, yeah, my mom locked me up in an institution. Boo hoo! But it did give an amazing discipline. It was like serious recruitment training and boot camp, and it was horrible and dark and very long-lived, a year and a half, but I needed it. I needed that whole insane discipline.  She clarifies that, yes, it was an institution for the mentally ill. The 40-year-old Barrymore—while sipping a Corona—notes that at 14,  I was so scared of not knowing where I was going. I really had a fear that I was going to die at 25,  but that  no matter how dark shit got, I always had a sense that there should be goodness. I never went all the way into darkness.  Her mother  occasionally  visited her at the hospital, she says, but when she got out at 14, she became legally emancipated from her parents, at the institution's suggestion.  It was a very important thing to experience for me,  she says of her hospitalization.  It was very humbling, very quieting.

In just two days, more than 150 people died in Liberia, the hardest-hit country. And WHO has warned that even those high tolls might be an underestimate as patients fear going to hospitals or are turned away from overcrowded facilities. No vaccine has yet been proved to be safe or effective in humans, says a WHO official. But thousands of doses of experimental vaccines should be available in the coming months and could eventually be given to health care workers and other people at high risk of the deadly disease, the organization says. Meanwhile, Liberian immigrants living in the United States without a visa won't be sent back to the epicenter of Ebola crisis in West Africa for at least another two years, the Obama administration said today. President Obama granted Liberian immigrants a legal protection called a  deferred enforced departure.  The decision extends deportation protections for Liberian immigrants that have been in place for more than a decade. The government first granted temporary protective status to Liberians during that country's bloody civil war; that protection expired in 2007.

"(Dec 11, 2015  12:11 AM) Two Afghan airmen who didn't show up for training at a US Air Force base in Georgia on Monday are missing, and authorities suspect it's because they don't want to go home. An Air Force spokesman tells USA Today that law enforcement officials are searching for Mirwais Kohistani and Shirzad Rohullah, who were being trained in aircraft maintenance. The spokesman tells 11Alive that the men were nominated by the Afghan Air Force and heavily vetted by US authorities before being accepted for training at Moody Air Force Base, so they probably don't pose a threat to anybody in the US.

A new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also finds Trump’s approval for his handling of the pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach. Even Trump’s standing on the economy, long the high water mark for the president, has fallen over the past few months. Those political headwinds have sparked a sudden summer shift: After spending months playing down the pandemic and largely ignoring the virus’ resurgence, Trump warned this past week that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. After repeatedly minimizing the importance of masks, Trump urged Americans to do exactly that. And after insisting he would hold a large convention in August, the White House scrapped those plans.","With 100 Days Til Election, Trump Faces Steep Climb","With ____ Days Til Election, Trump Faces Steep Climb",100,Copy( 100 ),0

Stacy Bailey was suspended from her position as an art teacher at Arlington's Charlotte Anderson Elementary School in 2017 after introducing herself to fourth-grade students with photos of family members and her fiancee, causing a parent to complain that she was promoting  the homosexual agenda.  The district agreed to a settlement after a judge ruled the suspension violated her 14th Amendment right to equal protection, NBC reports.

"(Mar 6, 2019  10:30 AM) If you were left feeling concerned after Luke Perry's death after a stroke at age 52, wondering if you, too, are at risk at such a young age—you're not alone. Articles abound in the wake of his death explaining that strokes can happen at any age. But, as the New York Times explains, the  vast majority  of strokes do, in fact, occur in  much older people.  When strokes do occur in younger patients, there are often different causes than those found in older patients. According to two experts who spoke to the Times, those causes can include such uber-specific events as a chiropractic adjustment, sports incident, or roller coaster ride causing an artery to tear and a blood clot to form and travel to the brain. And when strokes do occur in younger people, whose brains have not yet shrunk as they will in older adulthood, they are more at risk of fatal brain swelling, doctors tell USA Today. There are other, less freaky-sounding causes of stroke in the young as well: a hole in the heart, which about 25% of people possess and which makes some of those people more vulnerable to a stroke; a genetic mutation making certain people more prone to blood clots that travel to the brain; a heart defect or rhythm disturbance that causes clots to form and travel to the brain; certain drugs that cause arteries to suddenly narrow or close, cutting off blood flow to the brain; or an aneurysm. Kara Swisher writes in the Times that she, too, had a stroke, at age 49, with none of the usual warning signs such as high blood pressure; in her case, it was a transient ischemic attack, often referred to as a mini-stroke, brought about by the aforementioned hole in the heart, blood prone to clotting, and a long flight to Hong Kong.

Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, 61, announced the news on national TV yesterday, though he didn't say when Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani would take over. The younger Sheikh, however, is set to give a speech tomorrow and select a government afterward, the New York Times reports.  I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,  Sheikh Hamad said. He took over from his own father in 1995, though in a decidedly less friendly manner: He launched a bloodless coup. Indeed, this kind of willing handover of power is extremely unusual in Gulf Arab dynasties, the AP notes. There are unconfirmed murmurs that it's related to Sheikh Hamad's health, but he's likely to continue to play a role in government. Though the country's prime minister is also likely to depart, politics in Qatar—whose influence is growing—aren't likely to change much. Sheikh Tamim  has been involved very closely with Qatari policy, both domestic and foreign ... for some considerable time,  says an al Jazeera editor. Qatar has a sovereign wealth fund of some $100 billion, one of the biggest in the world, and it's been building its political resume as a mediator of international conflicts, including Darfur; the Taliban also recently opened a political office in the country.","Qatari Emir Abdicates, Hands Power to Son, 33","Qatari Emir Abdicates, Hands Power to Son, ____",33,Copy( 33 ),0

The relationship deteriorated when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014, and rebels supported by Russia launched an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have been killed. The Russian arrivals were taken off their plane and put on a bus for medical checkups, per the AP. Their names were not immediately released. Ukraine's arrivals were greeted with hugs from family and friends on the tarmac, recorded by news media. The Dutch government said the prisoners released by Ukraine included Volodymyr Tsemakh, who is suspected of being involved in the downing of flight MH17, in which 298 people were killed. His involvement delayed the exchange, and Dutch officials were allowed to interview Tsemakh again before his release. Film director Oleg Sentsov, who was sentenced in 2015 for what Russia called terrorism in a widely criticized case, also was released. Among the Ukranians freed were 24 sailors who were taken off Crimea in November. Russia has hopes that the exchange will result in an easing of European sanctions imposed over the fighting in eastern Ukraine. A NATO spokeswoman on Saturday said the exchange was a  step in the right direction  but called on Russia to release all prisoners.",Prisoner Swap Includes MH17 Crash Suspect,Prisoner Swap Includes MH____ Crash Suspect,17,Copy( 17 ),0
"(Dec 9, 2020  3:31 AM) They certainly weren't abiding by California's stay-home order: The Los Angeles sheriff's department arrested 158 people over the weekend who were attending an underground house party Saturday night into the wee hours of Sunday. Of those 158, 35 were underage, and few were wearing masks, the Guardian reports. The party was held at a vacant house in Palmdale without the owners' knowledge; the teenage organizer allegedly broke in, bringing party equipment in a U-Haul truck. An Instagram ad for the party promised exotic dancers, the Los Angeles Daily News reports. Authorities say the event's organizers have held two other similar gatherings, also in empty homes. Such parties  typically involve drugs, alcohol, weapons, minors and prostitution  and are illegal even when the country is not in the middle of a pandemic, Sheriff Alex Villanueva says. He adds that his department will be further cracking down on such  superspreader events  rather than focusing on businesses, which are currently under restrictions related to the governor's order, KTLA reports. Villanueva estimates at least six such events take place in the county per weekend. Nine weapons were recovered during the raid, and a 17-year-old victim of human trafficking was rescued. The Los Angeles Times reports the sheriff's department was tipped off about the party in advance, but let it go on so that the  elusive  organizers could be arrested.",158 Arrested at Los Angeles 'Superspreader' Party,____ Arrested at Los Angeles 'Superspreader' Party,158,Copy( 158 ),0

A new government report says that the emergency agency hasn't even tried to get back some $643 million in improper payments it made more than three years ago. What's the holdup? FEMA still hasn't given the final OK to a revamped process for recouping its own cash. The backlog involves some 160,000 applicants who requested aid after Katrina, Rita, and other disasters and wrongly received it, reports the AP; officials blame FEMA error, fraud, or other mistakes. A federal judge ordered the debt collection overhaul in 2007, and the measure has been awaiting approval of FEMA's administrator since late 2008. Current administrator Craig Fugate was confirmed in May 2009. A FEMA spokeswoman says the agency is  committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,  and is hurrying.

"(Aug 12, 2013  4:32 PM CDT) Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Motors and commercial space company SpaceX, has finally unveiled the  Hyperloop,  his much-hyped new transportation system idea. And it's pretty far out there. It's a bit like a human shotgun, explains Businessweek: people would sit inside aluminum pods, which would shoot through steel tubes at up to 800 miles per hour. It could also potentially hold cars. The pods would be mounted on skis above an air cushion, launched by an electromagnetic pulse and magnets, then propelled along the route by motors.  The pod can go just below the speed of sound relative to the air,  says Musk. Musk's vision is for a Hyperloop from LA to San Francisco, fueled by disappointment in the planned $70 billion California high-speed train, which he thinks will be too slow and expensive. Musk estimates a Hyperloop following the I-5 would cost $6 billion to build with pods just for people, or $10 billion for pods that could hold people and cars. Beyond that, he says, the system would work best for trips under 1,000 miles, like New York to DC or Boston. However, sci-fi fans and Californian commuters may be disappointed to learn that Musk has no plans to commercialize the Hyperloop yet.  I’m just putting this out there as an open source design,  he says.  I still have to run SpaceX and Tesla.  But if no one else takes his idea and runs with it, he may find time  down the road.

The agreement calls for the former couple's six children, who range in ages from 8 to 15, to continue to have  therapeutic visits  with Pitt, the AP reports. Jolie Pitt filed for divorce in September, days after Pitt was involved in a disturbance during a private flight with his family.

Though five boys were spotted near the stadium's press box before the fire, only four, ages 10 to 12, will be charged with first- and second-degree arson, criminal mischief, burglary, reckless burning, and reckless endangering.

That makes it the deadliest mass shooting in Canada's history, the AP reports. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer is among the dead; Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the force, was a mother of two. The 51-year-old suspect disguised himself as a police officer and shot several people in their homes and in other locations around Portapique, where he is believed to have lived part-time, starting Saturday night. He also set several homes in the area on fire. The suspect, who wore a RCMP uniform and made his car look like a RCMP cruiser, was ultimately intercepted by officers about 55 miles away at a gas station in Enfield by late Sunday morning. Police say he may have targeted his first victims but then gone on to kill  randomly.  The suspect and police exchanged gunfire at some point and the suspect ultimately died, but it's not clear how. A male RCMP officer also received non-life-threatening injuries. Mass shootings are fairly rare in Canada; prior to Sunday, the deadliest one had left 14 dead, plus the gunman, in 1989 at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college.

They did so, but Poland got the short end of the stick. The demise of the USSR raised the issue anew in the 1990s, and the two countries have been trying to hammer out a resolution since. They can't revert to the old borders because things have changed too much—roads, buildings, farms—so the Czechs have agreed to carve out 909 acres and give them to Poland.

Mack reportedly arrived in the Caymans on Nov. 27 and was required to quarantine for 14 days. Two days later, however, she removed a tracking bracelet and left her residence to attend Ramgeet's event. The boyfriend, 24, was charged with aiding and abetting Mack.

Jamie and Katie split,  the source says of the couple. E! News has its own source, confirming the breakup happened in May. Both publications note that the extremely private couple, who began their relationship denying there was one, had only recently started poking their heads out together in public, including with a joint pose at the Met Gala on May 6. Reps for both the 40-year-old Dawson's Creek actress, once married to Tom Cruise, and the 51-year-old comedian-actor-singer are staying mum, but Foxx was spotted leaving a Los Angeles hot spot Friday night holding hands with singer and model Sela Vave, 30 years his junior. TMZ reports the two appear to have been in each other's presence  since at least June.  Foxx hasn't confirmed this relationship, either, but then again, when first asked in 2013 if he and Holmes were an item, he called that idea  quite hilarious  and  100% not true,  per People.","After 6 Years of Rumors, a Rumored Split for Holmes, Foxx","After ____ Years of Rumors, a Rumored Split for Holmes, Foxx",6,Copy( 6 ),0

By signing up for online dating site Match.com and orchestrating a rotation of suitors eager to wine and dine her.  Before I barely had enough money to pay for food,  the 23-year-old tells Business Insider.  After using Match.com I found I wasn't going into debt anymore.  While scraping by in Murray Hill on her $45,000 salary, the young lady, who Business Insider dubbed Minerva McGonagall, discovered that investment banker types on Match.com would gladly buy her meals at ritzy restaurants. She went from spending $500 or more of her own money on monthly dinners to having admirers take her out five nights a week. She even started eating lighter lunches in advance of her indulgent dinners, to save even more, and instituted a rule: No more than five dates with the same guy. Eventually, she retired from the ploy:  It was exhausting,  she said.  I needed my sleep and I was done playing the game.

Non-Chinese can no longer enter from Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, even if they hold a valid visa or residence permit for China, the AP reports. Embassies in those countries have posted online notices in recent days announcing the temporary suspension of entry. China, where the coronavirus first emerged, has enacted strict measures to guard against new infections from abroad. Health authorities on Friday reported 30 imported cases in the most recent 24-hour period, including 15 in Shanghai. That brought the total number of imported cases during the pandemic to 3,510. China largely closed its borders in March but in recent months, it had relaxed restrictions, allowing some foreign nationals to enter if they tested negative for the virus and spent two weeks in quarantine, AFP reports. The country is now  drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation,  a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday. Citizens of countries including the US are still currently allowed to enter China, but the tightened restrictions require them to obtain a health certificate from a Chinese embassy within 48 hours of travel with results of a nucleic acid test and an antibody test.",China Bans Foreigners From 8 Countries,China Bans Foreigners From ____ Countries,8,Trans( eight ),1

"(Jun 11, 2014  6:41 AM CDT) The back story of the Bowe Bergdahl swap gets one detail richer today by way of a Wall Street Journal report on a classified assessment that found two of the five Guantanamo detainees that were to be released would likely end up back in a senior role with the Taliban. The news comes via unnamed US officials, who say the assessment—the work of spy agencies and completed while the swap was being debated—found that two others would likely take up active roles, while just one of the detainees would likely steer clear of the Taliban. The Journal sees the assessment as  ammunition  for lawmakers who have dubbed the swap unwise; one official counters that it's  not a rigorous mathematical equation  but simply a forecast of what could happen based on the men's former positions, connections, and experience at Gitmo. The two detainees named as likely to return to a senior leadership role are Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a onetime Taliban army chief of staff who we previously reported is wanted for allegedly killing thousands of Shiites near Kabul between 1998 and 2001; and Khairullah Khairkhwa, formerly an interior minister who was  directly associated  with Osama bin Laden. Abdul Haq Wasiq is the detainee branded by the assessment as unlikely to become an active Taliban member; the Journal reports that before his 2001 detention he had planned to hand intel to the US, and may harbor resentment over that detention in the face of such planned cooperation.",Secret Bergdahl Prediction: Only 1 Will Shun Taliban,Secret Bergdahl Prediction: Only ____ Will Shun Taliban,1,Trans( one ),1

These days, Uncle Sam spends a whopping $11 billion guarding classified info, twice what it spent a decade ago, the New York Times reports—and that's just the secrets it will tell us about. The total doesn't include any CIA or NSA spending because their budgets are, naturally, classified. The head of Information Security Oversight says that spending would boost the total by  less than 20%.  The figure is so high in part because of the explosion of security clearances in the wake of 9/11, which detractors said has led to reams of mundane-yet-classified information, and in part because of Cold War-era secrets that are still classified decades later—and which the government still goes to court to protect.

"(May 2, 2018  7:16 PM CDT) There's some disagreement about what went down when the Washington Redskins cheerleading squad traveled to Costa Rica in 2013. According to the five unnamed women Juliet Macur spoke to for the New York Times, the trip ended up feeling exploitative. They were at the Occidental Grand Papagayo resort for a calendar photo shoot; some of the 36 women were required to take off their tops at times to facilitate the shots, others wore body paint. And the women say they weren't able to model in privacy, but that male Redskins suite holders and sponsors were invited to watch. And they allege that one evening, nine of the women were told they had been selected to accompany the men to a club. The women describe their evening as escorts (no sex was involved) as  mandatory  and said they felt as if the team was  pimping us out.  Some reportedly cried at the news they had to participate. Macur writes the trip  provides a vivid illustration of how NFL teams have used cheerleaders for far more than sideline dancers during games,  particularly as the allegations of discrimination and mistreatment mount. But the women's account is contradicted by both the squad's director and choreographer, Stephanie Jojokian, and two women who were then squad captains and described the night at the club as unforced and  just a night of relaxation.  Jojokian tells the Times she  would never put a woman in a situation like that. I actually mentor these women to be strong and to speak up, and it kills me to hear that.

"(Dec 27, 2016  9:48 AM) For millennia, rape has been considered  a thing men do  during war, as a story at BuzzFeed puts it. Only recently have stories told by the survivors of rape shined a light on the price of this brutality—a thing that  ruined our hearts, our bodies, even our intelligence, our ability to think,  says one woman who was raped next to her baby (who was eventually killed) during the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. In a lengthy feature, Jina Moore reports that when five women stepped forward to tell their stories at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania in 1997 (two have since died), they didn't realize that they were about to change the world.  We were only supported by the truth,  as one put it. But their stories helped establish rape as a crime against humanity, and even as a form of genocide. The story doesn't stop there. The court had defined sexual assault as being about power, not about sexual gratification (one woman was raped by so many men she died during the ordeal), but the women found themselves in another fight over power, and this time against the UN itself. As Moore reports, a UN judge attempted to block a new documentary (The Uncondemned) detailing the women's stories and the implications of the court's decisions elsewhere in the world. The court says it worried about witness protection because the film discloses their identities, but the three surviving women all signed agreements permitting the use of their real names.

"(May 17, 2017  2:15 PM CDT) For the first time, women in their early 30s are having more babies than younger moms in the US, the AP reports. Health experts say the shift is due to more women waiting longer to have children and the ongoing drop in the teen birth rate. For more than three decades, women in their late 20s had the highest birth rates, but that changed last year, according to preliminary data released Wednesday by the CDC. The birth rate for women ages 30 to 34 was about 103 per 100,000; the rate for women ages 25 to 29 was 102 per 100,000. It's becoming more common to see older parents with kids in elementary or high school, says Bill Albert of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Meanwhile, more teens are growing up with fewer of their peers getting pregnant, he says.  We always talk about peer pressure as a negative, but it can be a force for good,  Albert says. Among the report's findings: the overall birth rate was down slightly in 2016, to 62 births per 100,000 women ages 15 to 44; the average age when women have their first child is about 28; and the teen birth rate continued to drop last year.",Report Reveals Historic 1st for American Moms,Report Reveals Historic ____st for American Moms,1,Trans( first ),1

Somehow, a wood-and-steel bench that weighed more than 100 pounds broke free from the wall and hit the boy, killing him, the Record reports. Brendan, a student at another local school, was a member of an indoor soccer team; practice was about to start at 6:30pm when the ball rolled near the table. Berkley Street also uses the gym as a cafeteria, and the fold-down tables and benches are stored vertically in the wall. Typically, they're secured with a key, and authorities don't know whether this one was properly secured or whether Brendan perhaps touched it. Only the left bench fell, while the table and the right bench remained in the wall. The bench apparently hit his head and he immediately collapsed; someone reportedly saw him trapped beneath the bench and ran to lift it off. The coach, an off-duty police officer, performed CPR as parents called 911, but Jordan was pronounced dead around 7:30pm at a nearby medical center. The gym is closed through at least the weekend as officials investigate.

The organizers put up video on Facebook showing the protest as it took place, per the Lexington Herald-Leader. By 5pm, the cops had shown up, and by 6pm, protesters were seen lined up by police, waiting to be taken to the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections.

"(Jan 6, 2019  5:48 AM)  Drake is cancelled,  declares one Twitter user, and he's not alone in that sentiment. This after a video of Drake with a 17-year-old fan was posted to Twitter late last week and has raised the Internet's collective eyebrow. In the clip, which TMZ reports is from a show at Colorado's Ogden Theatre in May 2010, Drake is seen on stage with a female fan. He smells her hair and appears to kiss her neck, then asks her age. When she responds with  17,  the crowd goes wild, and Drake says,  I can't go to jail yet, man! Seventeen? How do you look like that? You thick. Look at all this.  He then continues,  Well, seventeen ... I don't know if I should feel guilty or not but I had fun. I liked the way your breasts feel against my chest.  He then kisses her hand, cheeks, forehead, lips. TMZ notes that Drake was 23 when the video was shot, and the age of consent in Colorado is 17. But many outlets are seeing the timing as thorny, in that it was posted just after millions watched Lifetime's Surviving R. Kelly, which focuses on that singer's  decades of preying on young girls,  as the Daily Beast puts it. The outlet calls the Drake video  disturbing.  Vulture's take:  The incident points to an industry-wide problem, a casual disregard for the well being of underage fans.","Video of Drake With Girl, 17, Resurfaces, to Internet's Horror","Video of Drake With Girl, ____, Resurfaces, to Internet's Horror",17,Copy( 17 ),0
"(Aug 14, 2012  8:46 AM CDT) Bashar al-Assad's days sound awfully numbered if you listen to ex-Prime Minister Riad Hijab.  The regime is falling apart morally, materially, economically,  the defector told reporters in Jordan today.  Its military is rusting and it controls only 30% of Syria's territory.  Hijab wasn't part of Assad's inner circle, and has only been prime minister since June, but analysts tell the New York Times that, as the highest-ranking defection yet, he may have been privy to internal assessments. But Hijab doesn't expect to be the last high-level defection. He says there are lots of  leaders with dignity  in the government and military who are itching to defect. He says he ultimately left Damascus because the regime threatened his family. He's urging the opposition to unify and form a democratic government—though he doesn't want an office in it.

But it was neither impolite nor unusual in the case of the 1,100 guests at a Canadian couple's destination wedding in California. Dominic Husson and Louise Veronneau of Montreal on Tuesday exchanged vows at California's Cat House on the Kings, a no-kill no-cage cat sanctuary, in what KSEE describes as the  purr-fect  wedding day.  We are both animal lovers, and it shows,  Husson says.  She’s a great person, and that’s why I wanted to marry her.  In 2012, Veronneau visited the sanctuary and put it on her bucket list as a place to return to some day, reports KFSN. (Husson hadn't visited previous to the wedding.)  I feel in love,  Veronneau says.  I feel in love with the work [they're] doing for the cats and the rescuing.  Cat House on the Kings has been a permanent home for more than 24,000 cats and 7,000 dogs since it was first established 24 years ago, reports the CBC. The couple is the first to marry at the sanctuary, and founder Lynea Lattanzio admitted to pre-wedding jitters.

"(May 8, 2017  1:01 AM CDT) Gray wolves in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan could again find themselves in hunters' crosshairs—possibly as soon as this fall if federal protections are removed for the predators. A ruling is expected soon from an appeals court that recently lifted protections for wolves in Wyoming. In Congress, wolf-hunting supporters aren't giving up, even though a Minnesota representative was instrumental in killing an effort that would have allowed the three western Great Lakes states to resume wolf hunting, the AP reports. Gray wolves were once hunted to the brink of extinction in most of the country, but they recovered under Endangered Species Act protections and reintroduction programs. They now number over 5,500 in the lower 48 states, including nearly 3,800 in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has repeatedly tried to remove wolves in the three states from the endangered species list, but courts have stymied those efforts. Now, a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is looking at the issue. Lawmakers from the region have also tried to attach riders to various bills in Congress that would  delist  wolves, return management responsibilities to the states, and bar further court challenges.

There’s enough energy stored to produce about a magnitude 6.1 to 6.3 earthquake  with an epicenter in La Habra, which was hit by a quake in 2014, says a JPL geophysicist, per CBS LA. Earthquake scientists used information from the La Habra quake to make their predictions, and found that there's a 35% chance of an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.0 or greater, the Los Angeles Daily News reports. But other experts aren't convinced; KPCC goes so far as to call the JPL study  controversial.  As the US Geological Survey notes,  the accepted random chance of a (magnitude 5.0) or greater in this area in three years is 85%, independent of the analysis in this paper.  Plus, JPL's research  has not yet been examined by the long-established committees that evaluate earthquake forecasts and predictions made by scientists,  the USGS says, per LA Weekly.  The lack of details on the method of analysis makes a critical assessment of this approach very difficult.  And, as one Caltech seismologist who read the study notes,  As far as I’m concerned there has never been a successful earthquake prediction, and a scientific breakthrough would be required for us to make a scientifically based prediction.

Born in the Bronx to an industrial film director father and tap dance instructor mother, she left for the University of New Mexico after high school, but dropped out after two and a half years when she got pregnant and married the father of her child, Variety reports. After a series of jobs including a stint as a choreographer in Albuquerque, she left for Los Angeles in 1967, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Her brother Garry Marshall, 10 years her senior, was doing well in the entertainment industry, and with his encouragement, she studied acting and started getting roles in commercials, films, and television. She first played Laverne De Fazio in a guest spot on her brother's series Happy Days, which was well-received and ultimately led to her brother pitching Laverne & Shirley. It aired from 1976 to 1983, and Marshall began her directing career by directing some of its episodes. Her feature directorial debut was the Whoopi Goldberg-starring Jumpin’ Jack Flash in 1986; she went on to direct Tom Hanks in Big in 1988, which became the first female-directed film to gross more than $100 million. Her third film, Awakenings, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, was just the second female-directed film to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. She went on to direct many other films including A League of Their Own, which starred her only child, daughter Tracy, who was adopted by Rob Reiner during his 1971-79 marriage to Marshall.  Penny was a girl from the Bronx, who came out West, put a cursive 'L' on her sweater and transformed herself into a Hollywood success story,  says a statement from her family.",Penny Marshall Dies at 75,Penny Marshall Dies at ____,75,Copy( 75 ),0

China has called on the US to  stop handing over terrorist suspects to any third country, so as to expatriate them to China at an early date.

"(Feb 26, 2017  1:32 PM) Iran's navy began an annual drill Sunday near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, its first major exercise since the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, state television reported. The TV report quoted navy chief Adm. Habibollah Sayyari as saying the two-day maneuver will cover an area of 772,000 square miles in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean near the strait, the AP reports. It showed Iranian warships and helicopters taking part in the exercise. Nearly a third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait and it has been the scene of previous confrontations between the US and Iran. But the drill does not involve Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force the US Navy often criticizes for harassing its vessels. The US Navy's 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, declined to comment on the exercise or discuss if it had any plans to monitor the drill. Iran's navy routinely holds war games it says are aimed at improving its readiness against threats. It also sends its warships to international waters off the Gulf of Aden to fight piracy.",Iran Begins 1st Major Military Drill Since Trump Inauguration,Iran Begins ____st Major Military Drill Since Trump Inauguration,1,Copy( 1 ),0

"(Oct 28, 2011  9:21 AM CDT) Despite Mitt Romney's religion getting plenty of press—especially when a Rick Perry backer called it a cult—fewer than half of Americans know that he is a Mormon, according to a new poll. The Public Religion Research Institute poll found that 42% correctly identified him as a Mormon; 6% believed he was a Catholic or a Protestant, and 45% said they didn't know what Romney's religion was, the Hill reports. That's virtually unchanged from the 40% who were aware of his religion in July. The only group in which awareness of Romney's religion has gone up since July was white evangelicals—which could spell trouble for the candidate, notes the Washington Post.  We know from our research that six in 10 evangelicals do not see the Mormon faith to be a Christian religion,  PRRI’s research director says.  As more evangelical voters identify Romney as a Mormon, the question will be whether he can bridge the religious gap with shared political values.

And as the Daily News reports, it was the driver himself who ended up in handcuffs. The tale of the unusual bust involving 8 pounds of heroin worth $3 million began the morning of April 17, when customs officials at JFK busted a traveler from Africa with the drugs in his Samsonite. He agreed to proceed with his deal under the watch of federal agents and called the cell number he had been provided, reports the Smoking Gun. His contact turned out to be a 50-year-old bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority named Francis Abankwa. The traveler boarded Abankwa's bus in the Bronx with the drugs and stayed right through until the end of the route, remaining on board while all the other passengers exited. After he and Abankwa exited and started heading toward Abankwa's car, the feds swooped in for the arrest. Both face felony narcotics conspiracy charges, and Abankwa is looking at 10 years in prison if convicted.

"(Jul 29, 2016  7:22 AM CDT) An hour-long live TV special on Fox Saturday will lead up to two holding-your-breath minutes in which a veteran skydiver will leap out of a plane at 25,000 feet (no biggie) without something one usually needs for such a jump (kind of a biggie): a parachute. Per the AP, Luke Aikins won't be wearing a wingsuit, either, when he takes the 120mph plunge just north of LA, landing in a 10,000-square-foot net that's 20 stories high. That's high enough so he won't hit the ground, but also designed so he (hopefully) won't bounce back out. Still,  if I wasn't nervous, I would be stupid,  he says. Six months of prepping seem to have gone generally well, the Independent notes, though one test run with a 200-pound dummy didn't end as expected: The dummy crashed right through the net. The Washington state resident initially turned down the parachute-less idea when it was pitched to him by Hollywood PR man Jimmy Smith and partner Bobby Ware two years ago.

"(Apr 16, 2015  10:48 AM CDT)  Seventy is the new 50,  says Alan Walker, a social policy professor at the University of Sheffield, in response to new research that suggests that the upper limit for what falls under the  middle age  umbrella may extend all the way to 74—nine years longer than it's currently classified, the Telegraph reports. Researchers from Vienna's International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis contend that being considered elderly shouldn't rely on one's actual age, but on how long people are expected to live after retirement. The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the average retiree may enjoy her golden years for up to 24 years after the standard UK retirement age of 65 (compared to just 15 years after retirement in the 1950s, the paper notes). Using a definition of old age that means someone has 15 or fewer years left to live, IIASA scientists then pegged that magic transitional age at 74. And this trend is only expected to continue.  Older people in the future will have many characteristics exhibited by younger people today,  an IIASA deputy director says, per the Telegraph. Walker, however, doesn't totally agree on a set-in-stone figure.  There is a massive nine-year difference in average life expectancy between the poor and the affluent and a shocking 19-year difference in healthy life expectancy,  he tells the paper. Still, he acknowledges these findings of extended longevity are relevant because they'll affect certain societal needs, such as collecting pensions and other senior perks, and help people design financial plans that work. Meanwhile, a Cardiff University professor advocates not focusing on age, but on living well.  It is important not just to live longer, but to live healthier,  he tells the Telegraph.

Police were called to the scene shortly after midnight, which is when they found, burning in the street outside the bar, a car tire and a gay pride banner Martinez had ripped off the front of the Ames United Church of Christ, reported KCCI at the time.

"(Jun 26, 2016  4:04 PM CDT) With her Arizona home sold and most of her belongings packed up, Nancy Rae Hartz was ready to spend her golden years on the road. Divorced and widowed, she had recently found love again through a dating website, and the happy couple was going to travel in an RV. The 72-year-old left Kingman, Arizona, the morning of June 2, 2015, and her daughter hasn't heard from her since, the AP reports.  She said, 'Don't worry, baby. We'll keep in touch,'  daughter Denise Baggs recalls. Now authorities say Hartz's disappearance echoes that of two other women who lived within a roughly 100-mile radius. Verna Clayton, who would be 73 now, was last seen in June 2008 in the small town of Dolan Springs, Arizona. Neva Jane Lindley, who would be 77 now, was last seen in November 2011 in Las Vegas. Both cashed out their financial assets just before they disappeared. Both had begun a relationship with a man they met online. Mohave County sheriff's detectives say 69-year-old Robert Lawson Carnochan was that man. They found him living in Yucca with another woman, several aliases, and firearms. A search of his home turned up evidence that makes him a person of interest in the disappearances of all three women, police say. Today, Carnochan sits in a Kingman jail on unrelated charges, including identity theft and weapons violations, while police continue to investigate the disappearances.  Until we can come up with some more evidence, we're just going to keep doing everything we possibly can to find these women and find out any information we can about that and Mr. Carnochan,  says a sheriff's deputy.",Sheriff: 3 Missing Women Met Same Man Online,Sheriff: ____ Missing Women Met Same Man Online,3,Trans( three ),1

"(Feb 14, 2020  9:40 AM) If you're in your late 30s or older, you likely remember the unique joy that accompanied creating what we olds call a  mixtape.  A German woman is now reliving that elation after she stumbled upon a mixtape she lost 25 years ago while on vacation in Spain. Per the Guardian, Stella Wedell was only 12 in the mid-'90s when the cassette tape she'd recorded off a CD vanished either from Mallorca or the Costa Brava. Fast-forward to last summer, when Wedell wandered into Stockholm's Fotografiska and started looking more closely at the items in Mandy Barker's  Sea of Artifacts  exhibit, which showcased plastic debris recovered from the ocean. Wedell thought one cassette tape looked familiar, as did the track list that accompanied it.  I took a picture of it and compared it with the original CD,  she says, per the Sunday Post. Sure enough, it was a match, except the tape was missing the CD's first two songs—which made perfect sense to Wedell, as she hadn't liked those songs and so didn't include them. Per Sky News, the tape washed up in 2017 on the beach in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, and it was soon after picked up by Barker, who was looking for items for her exhibit. She says she let it dry out for 18 months then took it to an audio restorer. Amazingly, it still plays—which isn't the best of news.  The fact it has survived intact shows the durability of plastic and the threat it can pose to the marine environment,  Plymouth University researcher Richard Thompson tells the Guardian. The Sunday Post has the tape's track list, with such  oldies  as Shaggy's  Oh Carolina,  Soul Asylum's  Runaway Train,  and UB40's  (I Can't Help) Falling in Love With You.  Wedell will get her tape back after it finishes its exhibit run.","She Lost the Mixtape in the '90s. Then, an Improbable Reunion","She Lost the Mixtape in the '____s.

But while South Africa—with the continent's most developed economy and the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19—relaxed its strict lockdown, the reopening of most school classes was delayed and there was debate about how churches could safely resume services. South Africa has reported over 32,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 600 people have died. The government warns that the number of infections will continue to increase and that the peak isn't expected until August or September.

The New York teen joined a NASA program last summer and spotted an unknown planet orbiting two stars about 1,300 light-years away.  It was awesome,  he tells the New York Times.  I never expected to find anything.  The 17-year-old had joined NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., to help look over images from the TESS satellite. The goal is to find new planets, and sure enough, on his third day, Cukier spotted a tiny darkness on a distant sun. He then spent weeks working with his research mentors and other scientists confirming that the sun's decrease in brightness was in fact a planet, per ABC News. The planet's name isn't catchy—TOI 1338-b, partly an acronym for TESS Object of Interest—but it's interesting in other ways. It's 6.9 times bigger than Earth and orbits two suns, the first such  circumbinary  planet discovered by TESS. One sun is about 10% the size of Earth's, the other 30% the size; they orbit one another every 15 days, and Wolf's find can be seen crossing them in a so-called  transit event  every 93 to 95 days. Wolf seems humbled by it all:  You can’t be arrogant,  says the budding astrophysicist.  It is a planet, insofar as we can claim any other exoplanet, pretty much.

"(Mar 20, 2019  1:55 PM CDT) The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday and projected no rate hikes in 2019, dramatically underscoring its plan to be  patient  about any further increases. The Fed announced that it was keeping its benchmark rate—which can influence everything from mortgages to credit cards to home equity lines of credit—in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. It also said it will stop shrinking its bond portfolio in September, a step that should help hold down long-term interest rates. Together, the moves signal no major increases in borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. Some analysts believe the next rate move could be a cut later this year if the economy slows as much as some fear it might, reports the AP. In signaling no rate increases at all this year, the Fed's policymakers reduced their forecast from two that were previously predicted in December. They now project one rate hike in 2020 and none in 2021. The Fed's pause in credit tightening is a response, in part, to slowdowns in the US and global economies. It says that while the job market remains strong,  growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Fed officials expect economic growth of just 2.1% this year, down from its previous projection of 2.3% growth.

The news emerged at an emotional press conference Friday in Rochester, New York.  I never thought I would see this day, and now it's here,  said Wendy's mother, Marlene Jerome.  I just wish my husband had been alive to see this.  Suspect Timothy Williams, 56, was arrested Wednesday at his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and charged with second-degree murder, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. Officials relied on DNA taken from semen during an autopsy, but a 1999 search on the FBI's DNA database came up cold. Then came a  familial DNA  test. Approved by New York law in 2017, familial DNA searches can identify the suspect's family members and generate new leads.

As the Washington Post reports, the five Government Accountability Office employees—one of whom is also a school-board member in Prince George's County, Maryland—are charged with theft, fraud, and filing false applications for allegedly lying about their incomes to qualify their children for cheap or free school lunches over the past four years at a cost to the government of approximately $13,000.

Then Joseph James DeAngelo was busted in April 2018 for a slew of California murders that spanned two decades, and the Ozark Police Department decided to ship evidence from the Beasley-Hawlett crime scene to a lab that does the same type of DNA testing used in the DeAngelo case—and a DNA match came up tying 45-year-old Coley McCraney to the murders, Chief Marlos Walker tells ABC News.

Hidden beneath was his darkest secret: a note providing what the Guardian calls an  excruciatingly frank account  of his rape of Mary Symons, a female servant in a house in which he was staying. He would eventually marry her.  She was asleep but being gotten into the bed I could not easily be persuaded out again, and I confess that I did more than what was lawful or civil, but not in that manner that I ... think that she should prove with child,  he wrote.  I take God to witness I did not enter her body, all though I did attempt something in that nature.  The note was uncovered by Paul Cook, a senior paper conservator at London's National Maritime Museum.

"(Jul 18, 2019  12:23 PM CDT) The House has struck again: A day after addressing two hot-button issues, the legislative body voted Thursday to increase the US minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The 231-199 vote fell mostly on party lines and showed that centrist and liberal Democrats can still compromise, the Hill reports. Liberals won by getting the wage boost passed, while centrists managed to prolong the extension period by an extra year. It's the first congressional minimum-wage increase since the House voted in 2007 to raise it to $7.25, with a two-year grace period. But the GOP-controlled Senate isn't expected to approve the current plan. Yet it shows what Democrats would want if they win the White House and Senate in 2020, the New York Times reports. It also reveals a political shift since fast-food employees began fighting for $15 hourly wages and a union in 2012; $15 seemed high to many at the time, but now some communities have adopted it and others are feeling left behind.  In my district of Milwaukee, Wis., Milwaukeeans are stuck at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour set over a decade ago,  says Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat, who adds that  they are working themselves into poverty.

Police allege that David Lee Mangum has exposed some 300 sexual partners to HIV in the last decade, which is how long he has known he's had HIV. They say the 37-year-old told them as much during their interview with him, reports the Daily Statesman. Mangum was arrested Aug. 28 after a former partner, identified only as DB, contacted police. DB says Mangum told him he had no STDs, but that after the two broke up in June he received a phone call from Magnum's old roommate, who alerted him to Magnum's condition. DB's HIV test came back positive. The Los Angeles Times cites two jarring facts from the probable-cause statement. First, police wrote that Mangum did confirm to them that he  never disclosed he had HIV to any of his sexual partners in Stoddard County —that's a rural Missouri county where as many as 60 of the partners he claims to have had live. Second, Mangum says he never told those partners due to  fear of rejection.

Libert has been searching for a ship called the Griffin for three decades now. In 2001, he discovered a blackened timber slab near Poverty Island which may have been part of the ship, and he has done several sonar surveys of the site. But Libert and his crew have only just received a permit for archaeological excavations, which begin today, reports the AP. The Griffin—known as Le Griffon to those who sailed it—was commanded by French explorer La Salle. It was built in 1679 near Niagara Falls, and sailed the Great Lakes to what is now Wisconsin. La Salle sent the ship back to fetch supplies, and it was never seen again. Based on his research, Libert believes it was hit by a storm just a few miles into its journey. Soon, he'll know whether 30 years of searching and diving have finally paid off.  Right now I'm pretty excited, from what I know so far,  he says.  [But] scientific [proof] is 100%.

That's even more impressive considering the legal driving age in the UK is 18.  I decided that instead of paying for them, I should try and fight,  Browder says in a blog post. Less than two years later, the 19-year-old Stanford student's artificially intelligent chatbot— the world's first robot lawyer —has successfully appealed 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York.  I created it for a few family and friends and could never have imagined that in a few short months it would have appealed over $4 million [in parking tickets].  Browder's DoNotPay guides people through appealing tickets with simple questions, such as whether parking signs were clearly visible, at no charge. In 2015, New York City issued a record $1.9 billion in traffic fines.  I think the people getting parking tickets are the most vulnerable in society,  Browder tells Venture Beat.  These people aren’t looking to break the law. I think they’re being exploited as a revenue source by the local government.  With a success rate of 64% so far, DoNotPay is cutting into that revenue stream.  The government don’t like me very much, but people with parking tickets do,  Browder says in the blog post.

But that doesn't mean the ex-New England Patriot is going to be a free man any time soon. Hernandez is currently serving life without parole for murdering an acquaintance in 2013. The double murder charges stemmed from an altercation that reportedly started over a spilled drink and ended with Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado dead. According to CNN, Hernandez was acquitted of all eight charges related to the double murder except for a single weapons possession charge. The judge added four to five years to the end of Hernandez's current life sentence for that charge. Hernandez's defense team cites a lack of evidence as the reason for the acquittal and claims Hernandez's friend, who testified against him, is the actual killer. One of the eight charges against Hernandez was for witness intimidation for allegedly shooting the friend in the face to keep him from testifying. An attorney for Hernandez says the 27-year-old is  relieved  about the verdict. The attorney tells the Boston Globe he hopes people will now see Hernandez  for who he is—a very good young man.

"(Mar 29, 2017  9:16 PM CDT) In the late 1980s, Danny Rubin, who was writing industrial film scripts at the time, made a list of his 10 best ideas. The final entry on the list read,  A man lives the same day over and over.  After the No. 2 idea on Rubin's list got sold and made into Hear No Evil starring Marlee Matlin, an agent wanted another script, and Rubin chose that No. 10 idea—which became Groundhog Day. Why did Rubin choose to center the movie around a holiday, which he decided to set on Feb. 2? He was hoping, as S.I. Rosenbaum explains in an extensive piece for the New Yorker, that the film would become a  holiday cable perennial.  It worked. Rosenbaum traces the film's journey, from Rubin's first draft to the final draft, from the movie's initial modest success to its current cult status. Despite its insane popularity, Rubin never went on to have another hit. Hollywood people kept trying to get him to make another movie, but he didn't want to make just a standard rom-com, and he turned them all down.  I was always thinking, I’m not a one-hit wonder, I’m not a one-hit wonder!  he tells Rosenbaum.  But even if I am—OK, that’s more than most people get.  Then, in 2012, Rubin's own life began to resemble Groundhog Day when Tim Minchin and Matthew Warchus approached him about turning the film into a musical. They had to convince him they weren't going to ditch him along the way, and they didn't—Rubin has been a part of the entire process, which resulted in the beloved movie becoming a beloved musical.

The bad news is that was mostly for people aged 65-74—the percentage remains virtually unchanged for people under 65, who accounted for more than half of these deaths last year.

For three months, Taylor and his deputy, John Sheardown, hid at their Tehran homes the six US hostages who escaped from the American Embassy after it was overrun by Iranian student radicals on Nov. 4, 1979. Along with the CIA, Taylor helped arrange the hostages' escape by procuring plane tickets and fake Canadian passports. It was an incredibly risky operation that included passport foul-ups and a suspicious airport official, but the six hostages flew to safety from Tehran's airport on Jan. 28, 1980, the New York Times reported. Taylor's Iran exploits were chronicled both in the 2013 documentary Our Man in Tehran and in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo, though critics complained of the latter movie's inaccuracies, saying it minimized the Canadians' role in the rescue and gave most of the credit to the CIA.

"(Jun 1, 2011  2:36 AM CDT) A Texas man allegedly scammed out of a lottery jackpot by a convenience store clerk is taking the state lottery commission to court. Navy veteran Willis Willis, 69, says clerk Pankaj Joshi told him his ticket was not a winner, then kept it for himself, cashed it in for $1 million, and fled to his native Nepal. A court awarded Willis $395,000 found in the clerk's accounts and Willis is suing for the remainder, notes the Austin American-Statesman. The lottery vendor didn't play by the rules but still ended up with the money,  the suit states.  Willis won a million dollars fair and square. The Texas Lottery owed him that money.  The Texas Lottery Commission maintains that a lottery ticket is a  bearer instrument  and jackpots may not be paid twice.

"(May 14, 2012  11:47 AM CDT) Most rappers hope their songs will be a hit—not make them the target of one. That's the situation facing Shahin Najafi, an Iranian rapper living in Germany who's accused of having  grossly insulted  an important Shi'ite Muslim religious figure in one of his songs. He now has a $100,000 bounty hanging over his head, compliments of an Islamist website that says the rapper spoke of Ali al-Hadi al-Naqi, one of the 12 imams, irreverently in the song, Reuters reports, citing Iranian media. The song is also accused of satirizing the Islamic republic; it includes references to the 2009 presidential election, economic sanctions, and Iranians' fondness for nose jobs, among other things. But Najafi denies all the allegations related to the song, which is fashioned as a prayer and has become very popular with Iranians. In addition to the reward offered to anyone who kills him, Najafi could also face a death sentence if the song is deemed blasphemous, according to a senior cleric in Iran.","Islamist Website: Kill This Rapper, and We'll Pay $100K","Islamist Website: Kill This Rapper, and We'll Pay $____K",100,"Paraphrase( 100,000 , K )",1

And the situation could worsen, with 46% of employers unsure if hiring levels will rebound by the fall. Employers previously intended to keep college grad hiring levels even with last year, said an official who published the findings.

"(Jun 3, 2015  2:33 PM CDT) Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and senator of Rhode Island, launches his bid for the Democratic nomination this evening, and clearly everything will have to go his way if he hopes to pull an upset. Which is why this Facebook post from his wife, spotted by an editor at National Journal, doesn't bode well:  Does anybody from my Husband's staff remember his FB page access?  Yes, it's authentic, reports Bloomberg. Stephanie Chafee is looking for anyone who recalls how to log in to the page Chafee used as governor, so it can be merged with his 2016 presidential page. It seems the former is getting more traffic. Once the campaign gets past that hurdle, Chafee will have to work on name recognition. NPR helps with a primer on his political career, observing that  it is not often that a person can be said to have personally ended an era, but Chafee may well be remembered as the last liberal Republican to serve in the U.S. Senate.  Chafee was originally a Republican before becoming an independent and, finally, a Democrat. Even while with the GOP, however, he consistently ranked less conservative than even some Democrats, thanks to his support of gay marriage, abortion rights, a higher minimum wage, and more taxes on the rich.

"(Mar 12, 2012  8:12 AM CDT) An Oregon couple has been awarded $2.9 million in a case centered not around wrongful death, but wrongful birth. Ariel and Deborah Levy said they would have terminated their pregnancy had they known their daughter would have Down syndrome—but they were continually told the child would not. On Friday, a jury agreed Legacy Health System was negligent, citing five instances. Among them: The doctor took an incorrect tissue sample in order to determine the chromosomal profile; it was apparently analyzed incorrectly as well. Lawyers for the hospital said they were  disappointed  in the verdict and looking into their options. The couple had originally asked for $7 million, and will use the money to care for their child, now four.  These are parents who love this little girl very, very much,  said the couple's lawyer.

The swimmer has won 21 Olympic gold medals, 12 of them in individual events—and those dozen personal medals mean Phelps has tied an Olympic record that had been held for 2,168 years, Deadspin reports. Olympic historian Bill Mallon was first to report that Phelps had tied the record held by Leonidas of Rhodes, a sprinter who won multiple events at the 154th Olympiad in 164 BCE, and then at the next three Games, ultimately winning 12 individual titles. But, as Deadspin notes, he got wreaths instead of medals to mark his victories. Phelps could potentially overtake Leonidas: He competes in the 200m individual medley Thursday and the 100m butterfly Friday.

"(Jul 29, 2013  7:05 AM CDT) Ankle bracelets that let authorities track parolees and sex offenders released into the community are now being worn by more than 100,000 Americans, but what happens when the alarm sounds? All too often, the answer is nothing, an AP investigation finds. The devices are generating vast numbers of alerts—often for nothing more than a brief loss of satellite contact—leaving overburdened officials unable to cope and in some cases, allowing defendants with bracelets to commit new crimes. In Colorado, 212 parole officers have an average of 15,000 alerts per month to follow up on. One Colorado offender, Evan Ebel, tampered with his monitoring bracelet but the alarm wasn't checked on for five days, and he had killed two people—including the head of the state's Department of Corrections—by the time an arrest warrant was issued.  I think the perception ... is that these people are being watched 24 hours a day by someone in a command center. That's just not happening,  says an official in Florida's Orange County, where almost all GPS monitoring has been suspended while programs are being revised. In some states including Florida, lawmakers are pushing for tougher punishment for people who tamper with the bracelets.","With 100K Ankle Bracelets, Alarms Often Unheard","With ____K Ankle Bracelets, Alarms Often Unheard",100,"Paraphrase( 100,000 , K )",1
"(Aug 21, 2016  11:13 AM CDT) Drivers are generally leery of electric cars over the simple fear that the battery's charge will run out and leave them stranded. But now researchers from MIT and the Santa Fe Institute report in Nature Energy that range anxiety is overblown in the vast majority of the US. They used the Nissan Leaf for the study—at $29,000, a relatively affordable alternative to pricey Teslas—and concluded that it has a  real-world range  of 73 miles, reports Ars Technica. (That's less than the advertised range because it takes into account air conditioning, etc.) Bottom line:  What we found was that 87% of vehicles on the road could be replaced by a low-cost electric vehicle available today, even if there’s no possibility to recharge during the day,  says MIT's Jessika Trancik, per the Washington Post. The figure rises above 90% in the city and bottoms out at 81% for rural driving. Of course, range isn't the only barrier when it comes to widespread adoption. Drivers would still need to figure out alternatives on days when an EV vehicle won't do—long business trips or vacations, for example. One researcher suggests car-sharing programs could help with that, though he acknowledges that would require  further business innovation.  Still, they conclude that the excuse that an electric car's range doesn't cut it is, for almost everyone, just that—an excuse.

"(Aug 28, 2019  10:21 AM CDT)  They put me through hell.  So says a legal permanent resident of Maryland jailed for 82 days after a false-positive test indicated there was liquid meth in three bottles of honey he brought back from his native Jamaica. Leon Haughton initially thought canines at Baltimore's airport detected the KFC chicken in his luggage on Dec. 29. But soon Customs and Border Protection agents  said I was charged with methamphetamine,  Haughton tells WJLA.  I said 'what is methamphetamine?'  An in-state lab test found no drugs in the honey roughly three weeks later and the felony charges were dropped. But the Washington Post reports that his original airport arrest for drug felonies as a green-card holder triggered an immigration detainer. A judge said he couldn't be released unless the detainer was lifted. His lawyer said he couldn't reach anyone at ICE. And so Haughton spent two more months jailed until an additional federal lab test echoed those results and the misdemeanor was dropped too. When he was finally freed in March, the father of six had lost jobs as a cleaner and construction worker.  All my insurances collapsed, my credit was destroyed,  the 46-year-old now living at a Days Inn tells WJLA.  They just left me a mess  and never apologized. The Anne Arundel County Prosecutor's Office says no error occurred.  A specially trained drug sniffing dog was alerted to the presence of a controlled dangerous substance and a preliminary test done by the police officers further tested positive,  the office says, per CNN. Haughton's attorney says lawsuits are  imminent.

"(Oct 1, 2019  9:00 AM CDT) New York City is cracking down on xenophobia, with new guidelines that ban calling people  illegal aliens  in an attempt to  demean, humiliate, or harass  them; threatening to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an attempt to discriminate; or telling anyone to  speak English  or  go back to your country.  The penalty for defying the prohibition by the city's Commission on Human Rights is steep—a possible $250,000 fine for each instance. The city first announced the ban last week, noting:  Hate has no place here.   We are proud to have worked with the NYC Commission on Human Rights to produce and release this important guidance as we combat the federal government's rhetoric of fear and xenophobic policies that have threatened the health and well-being of immigrant communities,  says Bitta Mostofi, head of the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs. The commission released a 29-page directive to help guide the enforcement of this mandate, which is a human rights effort to make sure  no New Yorker is discriminated against based on their immigration status or national origin,  per Deputy Mayor Phil Thompson. The commission says it's currently looking into at least four cases in which ICE was dangled as a threat to intimidate or harass. The guidelines apply to employment and housing, as well as to all users of public accommodations such as restaurants, stores, nightclubs, parks, and other public spaces. Damages will also be available to complainants.  Today’s guidance makes abundantly clear that there is no room for discrimination in NYC,  commission chief Carmelyn P.

When they grabbed the same bridge to pull themselves out, they were electrocuted. The Solano Irrigation District has now agreed to pay $7 million to the family of each boy, the Sacramento Bee reports. The families filed a legal complaint in June, alleging that the utility's employees had jury-rigged a breaker without properly grounding the system, which  could and did allow the metal walking bridge to become electrically energized, resulting in fatal injuries to the users of the bridge.  The district said that while the cause of the tragedy  has not been fully determined,  it is  committed to ensuring that an accident like this is never repeated.  It said it has also settled claims with two boys who were shocked but survived.

"(May 7, 2018  12:30 PM CDT) An ancient virus that has been called a cousin of HIV is  off the charts  prevalent in Australia, affecting more than 40% of adults in remote regions, experts tell CNN. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, or HTLV-1, is considered a sexually transmitted infection since it can be spread through unprotected sex; it can also spread via blood contact and breastfeeding. It weakens the immune system and can lead to a number of serious health conditions; in up to 10% of cases, a  rapidly fatal  form of leukemia develops, the Guardian reports. Yet the chair of the Global Virus Network's HTLV-1 Task Force, whose lab first detected the virus in 1979, says almost nothing has been done to attempt to screen for, treat, or vaccinate against the disease.  The virus is neglected, and the diseases that it causes are neglected,  says another expert. HTLV-1, whose DNA can be found in Andean mummies from 1,500 years ago, is present around the world, but is highly endemic in several areas including the central Australia cluster.

"(Jan 11, 2020  5:30 AM) A drumming rock legend has died. Rush's Neil Peart, who the CBC notes was  revered by fans and fellow musicians as one of the greatest drummers of all time,  passed away Tuesday at age 67 in Santa Monica, Calif., per a statement issued by a family spokesperson, after being diagnosed with brain cancer more than three years ago. The Canadian band, made up of fellow members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, announced his death Friday afternoon on social media  with broken hearts and the deepest sadness,  asking fans who wanted to help to make a donation to a cancer charity or research group. Peart was also behind much of the lyrics for the band's songs—which NBC News notes were  heavily influenced by science fiction, philosophy, and classic literature —and was known for the elaborate drum and percussion setup that surrounded him as he performed. Peart started drumming as a teen after getting  a pair of sticks, a practice pad, and lessons,  he said in a 2005 interview. He teamed up with Lee and Lifeson in 1974, and Rush soon attracted a worldwide following, selling millions of records. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994, and into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Peart's death brought reaction from big names in music and politics. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that  we've lost a legend,  while fellow Canadian rocker Bryan Adams offered his own condolences. Paul Stanley of Kiss and Slash of Guns N' Roses also had messages to share.  Rest in peace brother,  Rush's statement ended. Peart is survived by his wife, Carrie, and his daughter Olivia. He had another daughter, Selena, who died in a 1997 car accident at age 19; his first wife, Jackie, died shortly after Selena from cancer.",A Drumming Legend Dead at 67,A Drumming Legend Dead at ____,67,Copy( 67 ),0

The first-term Democratic congresswoman, who kicked off her re-election campaign in Queens Saturday while remarking that she  would never begrudge anyone trying to run in a primary,  is facing 13 challengers—and five of them are from her own party. AOC, whom the Guardian refers to as a  leftist superstar,  has inspired passionate loyalty among her fans—but she's quite divisive, even among Democrats. Three of her challengers appeared on Fox & Friends Monday, including one Democratic challenger who said that she's a socialist Democrat but that the people in her district aren't socialists. All three took her to task for not spending enough time in her district. But the Guardian talked to her constituents on the street, and found that most were supportive of AOC.  Give her a chance! We knew who she was when we sent her, that she’d make a noise, and making a noise was why we sent her,  said one, hearkening back two years to when AOC unseated the Democratic incumbent.  She’s done good things for the Bronx,  argued another. The Guardian also notes that some of AOC's challengers appear to be running in a mostly symbolic fashion, as they have little fundraising power and likely won't even get the 4,000 signatures needed to appear on the ballot. The Republican challengers likely don't stand a chance in the general election, considering AOC won the solidly blue district by 78% in 2018. The paper pegs former CNBC anchor and author Michelle Caruso-Cabrera as AOC's most significant Democratic challenger so far.

The notion came to Winter (formerly Rafael Lozano) as he sat in a Starbucks in Texas in 1997.  My original motive was simply to accomplish something unique,  he says. But he's found  many joys  along the way, including  the photography and the puzzle-like challenge of my mission.  Ironically, while he respects Starbucks for amenities like clean bathrooms and WiFi, he's not crazy about the product:  Unless I am checking a new store off my list, I would not go there for the coffee,  he says. In his free time he savors the artisanal coffee at independent shops, BuzzFeed reports. His website says he's visited 96% of Starbucks in Canada and the US, and traveled as far as New Zealand, the Bahamas, Jordan, France, Taiwan, and Lebanon, Business Insider reports. He has also downed 29 cups of coffee in a single day, and spent $1,400 flying to British Columbia to visit a Starbucks before it shut down. His freelance work gives him the freedom to pursue the Starbucks dream, but he's only visited 11,700 of the chain's 17,000 stores so far:  As you can imagine, Starbucks is not going anywhere,  he says.  I can see myself visiting new stores as an old man.  As for the name Winter, he apparently invented it because his credit report  included accounts that belong to my father.

Ian Powers, 32, disappeared during a Nov. 12 game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, leaving his girlfriend and her two children behind. Police say a fully clothed body was found Saturday about a mile offshore from a marina approximately 2 miles from the stadium, ABC reports.

Per the AP, Pence released a statement Sunday disavowing a New York Times story that reports he’s among Republicans gearing up for a shot at the White House in 2020 should Trump decide not to run for reelection. Pence’s statement said the article  is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team.  It called the allegations  categorically false,   laughable and absurd,  and described them as an attempt by the media to divide the Trump administration. The Times piece looks at members of the GOP who are possibly laying the groundwork for  shadow campaigns,  citing political maneuvers and fundraising by senators Cotton and Sasse as well as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. But the article considers Pence at length, calling him the  pacesetter,  with mentions of his fundraising committee recently racking up $1 million at a Washington fundraiser, and his robust political event schedule. It says unnamed advisers to the vice president have indicated to donors that Pence is interested in a presidential bid, but only if Trump doesn't seek another term. Kellyanne Conway doubled down on Pence’s statement during media rounds, saying,  It is absolutely true the vice president is getting ready for 2020—for reelection as vice president  on ABC’s This Week.

A study from economists at MIT and Boston University published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research attempts to quantify the effects of industrial automation on American employment. It found that between 1990 and 2007, each robot added to the workforce reduced employment in the local commuting area by three to six jobs, Quartz reports. The addition of one robot per thousand workers also lowered wages by 0.25% to 0.5%. Overall, the report estimates robots cost the US between 360,000 and 670,000 jobs total during the span in question, according to the Verge. But robots don't affect all jobs equally. Unsurprisingly, robots had the biggest impact on the wages of America's lowest earners—blue collar workers and those without a college education—and could be responsible for growing the wage gap, Bloomberg reports. The automotive industry has taken the brunt of the robot uprising, with 39% of the US' industrial robots working in that industry. Some experts expect the number of robots working in the US to more than double by 2025 to more than 3 million. And it remains to be seen whether the market will find new jobs for humans, as it has after the advent of new technologies in the past, or whether robots will continue to depress employment and wages into the future.

The earth’s average temperature rose to 58.12 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.12 degrees above the 20th-century average. It was the 34th straight year that temperatures have been above average.  This warmth reinforces the notion that we’re seeing climate change,  one scientist tells USA Today. The year saw a number of brutal heat waves—most notably Russia’s—and he notes that  the probability of these events does increase as the climate warms.  But another climatologist notes that the temperature trend is  pretty flat from the 1990s.

"(Feb 4, 2015  9:13 AM) A new study finds that, despite your intentions, you may simply be inclined to cheat or not to cheat. As Phys.org reports, humans appear to be the rare mammals that can be either monogamous or polygamous—other species are typically one or the other. And now, University of Oxford researchers say they've found that some humans (53% of women and 43% of men) are more inclined to be faithful, while others (57% of men and 47% of women) are more inclined to be promiscuous.  This research suggests that there may be two distinct types of individuals within each sex, pursuing different mating strategies,  the researchers say of their results, published in Biology Letters. To get these results, the team compared the results from a questionnaire of sexual habits to data on something called the  2D:4D  ratio. That ratio has to do with finger length: The longer your ring finger is when compared to your index finger, the higher the levels of testosterone you were likely exposed to in the womb; these higher levels have been linked to a higher chance of promiscuity.  While not predictive of individual behavior, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous,  a University of Oxford press release explains. The researchers compared those results to the questionnaire data because, one explains,  human behavior is influenced by many factors, such as the environment and life experience, and what happens in the womb might only have a modest effect on something as complex as sexual relationships.  (Meanwhile, jealous men and women focus on very different things.)",57% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,____% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity,57,Copy( 57 ),0

The incident highlighted the enduring presence and unpredictable striking power of the ISIS militants in the strategic city, which serves as a hub for migrants heading to Europe. The gunmen  exploited a security vacuum  by deploying in the city center as the military was occupied conducting raids elsewhere, the head of the Sabratha Military Council tells the AP. A second security official said the militants used the headless bodies of the officers they killed to block the roads leading to the security headquarters—which they occupied for about three hours. The official said the total number of officers killed in the occupation and ensuing clashes reached 19. Sabratha has become the latest Libyan power center for the local ISIS affiliate. Last week, US airstrikes killed dozens of suspected militants in the city along with two Serbian hostages kidnapped last year.

Soldiers and police took up positions outside the station, which was evacuated, the AP reports. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, the city prosecutor's office told CNN.

Not so fast: Federal tax bills are at historic lows this year, and for the third consecutive year, families and businesses will pay less than they did under George W Bush. The government’s take—as a share of the national economy—is its lowest since 1950, the AP reports. And we have the weak economy and an increasing number of tax breaks to thank for the fact that income tax payments will be almost 13% lower than they were in 2008. While income tax rates are unchanged, new deductions, credits, and exemptions are added to the tax code each year, and this year, that means families with two dependent children earning up to $50,000 can avoid paying federal income taxes entirely, while lower-income families can actually make money. That’s bad news for the federal budget deficit, which is expected to reach a record $1.5 trillion this year.

It would see 35 of Guantanamo's 91 inmates transferred to other countries by this summer, while the remaining detainees would be moved to one or several of 13 possible military and federal prisons in the United States, per the Washington Post and the AP. At least some of the sites under consideration are in South Carolina, Kansas, and Colorado. The move would require up to $475 million in construction costs, though officials say closing Guantanamo will save $180 million per year. Annual operating costs for the US facilities would range from $265 million to $305 million. Since a law exists barring Guantanamo detainees from US soil, Congress would need to alter it to approve the plan. Critics say it would put Americans' safety at risk and the mayor of Leavenworth, Kan.—home to the maximum security Army prison under consideration for Guantanamo detainees—previously told NPR that she's  absolutely against  Guantanamo prisoners moving there. Many locals in Canon City, Colo., home to the Centennial Correctional Facility also under consideration, feel similarly.

Ambulances were seen leaving the scene. The development comes a day after four other boys were successfully rescued, the BBC reports. The massive operation, involving around 90 divers, was put on hold overnight so air tanks could be replaced, reports the AP. The second phase of the operation was launched Monday morning local time, with divers returning to the cave system. The boys (there were a total of 12) and the coach will be brought out one by one, with each escorted through the cave network by two divers, authorities say. Narongsak Osottanakorn, chief of the rescue mission, says the first four rescued boys have been hospitalized and haven't been reunited with their families yet because of the risk of infection, though they may be allowed to see them through a glass door. He says that water levels in the cave system, where a massive pumping operation has taken place, haven't risen despite rain on Sunday, and some passageways are walkable. Authorities decided to carry out the high-risk rescue because monsoons threatened to flood the caves even more, including the dry ledge where the trapped boys and their coach ended up.

At issue: the dealership’s failure to remove a decal bearing the name and phone number of the Texas City man's business, which he says destroyed his livelihood and resulted in ongoing  shock, fear, anxiety, mental anguish, humiliation, and degradation  after a photo of his truck in Syria was widely circulated. In the suit filed last week, Mark Oberholtzer of Mark-1 Plumbing claims that, as he traded in the 2005 Ford F-250 in October 2013, he began to remove the decal, but a salesman said to  let them handle it.  The suit traces the pickup's journey from a local auto auction to Mersin, Turkey. At some point, it entered Syria, as evidenced by a photo of the vehicle in Aleppo tweeted last December by an Ansar al-Deen militant. The photo showed the truck, now outfitted with an anti-aircraft weapon, with  plaintiffs' logo and phone number … still on the vehicle door,  the suit says. Further, that photo reached millions of people through social media and TV (the final episode of the Colbert Report, for one). On Dec. 17, 2014, the suit says, Oberholtzer’s business and personal phones received more than 1,000 calls from people who variously yelled expletives, sang in Arabic, and made  threats of injury or death.  In his suit, Oberholtzer alleges that AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway admitted to having  never touched the truck ; said removing the decal wasn't its responsibility; and hung up on him.

A climber sheltering from the rain happened upon four coins in Dovedale, Derbyshire, reports the Ashbourne News Telegraph, which led to a National Trust excavation of the site, called Reynard’s Cave.

The discovery is a triple mystery: Roman coins have never been found in a cave, coins from these two civilizations have never been buried together, and the Corieltavi have long been thought to have occupied areas further east during the Late Iron Age. The stash was possibly hidden in a cave for protection; Late Iron Age coins were largely symbols of power and status, rather than used to buy goods. However, it's possible the coins' owner squirreled away his  best stuff,  or was awaiting an increase in their value, speculates one archeologist on the dig.

"(Jun 6, 2018  11:30 AM CDT) Polish newlyweds Magdalena Czarnecka and Michael Wangrat planned to take a full year for their honeymoon, first climbing Denali in Alaska, then trekking from Montana to New Mexico via the Continental Divide Trail before ultimately ending up in Central America. Instead, just 10 days into the epic trip, as Czarnecka ascended a ridge with Marek Paleski, her husband's cousin who had joined them for the climb, Paleski slipped. The climbers were roped together, but they weren't clipped into any of the aluminum pickets placed on the route for safety (Czarnecka tells the Anchorage Daily News they may have been in between two of them at the time, with their rope unable to reach the next one). Czarnecka tried to use her ice ax to stop the pair's slide, but she couldn't; they slid 1,000 feet before dropping into a crevasse. Somehow, they just missed what could have been a fatal fall into a basin far below. The miracles continued: Czarnecka lost consciousness but regained it after 30 minutes or so and was responsive when rescuers finally reached the pair the next day. A guided climbing party that witnessed the fall alerted rangers, and Paleski set off a personal locator beacon to let rangers know it was a rescue effort, not a recovery effort. Rangers say it's a miracle Czarnecka survived. She and Paleski spent a long night trying to stay warm, and the next day, Paleski set out alone and found a rescue group. Czarnecka has been hospitalized two weeks and had surgery to repair some of the damage to her head and neck, and she and her new husband hope to return to Poland this week. Though their honeymoon ended up far from what they'd planned,  after this trip, we are stronger,  she says.",Yearlong Honeymoon Lasts 10 Days After Denali Accident,Yearlong Honeymoon Lasts ____ Days After Denali Accident,10,Copy( 10 ),0
"(Oct 19, 2017  2:12 AM CDT) The father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June says he was  floored  when President Trump promised to write him a check for $25,000—but it never arrived. Chris Baldridge tells the Washington Post that when Trump called a few weeks after his son, Army Sgt. Dillon Baldridge was killed, he told the president that he and his wife were struggling to deal with the fact that their son and two others were killed by a rogue Afghan police officer instead of in battle. Baldridge, a construction worker in North Carolina, says Trump offered him $25,000 after he complained that his son's $100,000 death benefit would go to his ex-wife instead of his parents, even though he can  barely rub two nickels  together.  He said, 'I'm going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,' and I was just floored,  Baldridge says.  He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this.'  But no check arrived in the following months, and Baldridge says Trump also failed to follow through on a promise to have his staff set up an online fundraiser. CNN reports that when asked about Baldridge's case Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the check  has been sent.   It's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the president, and using it to advance the media's biased agenda,  she said.

The first Allied submarine lost in World War I, and Australia's first sub lost ever, has finally been found on the 13th search mission for a vessel that vanished more than a century ago. The HMAS AE-1 was spotted by an underwater drone in almost 1,000 feet of water near Papua New Guinea's Duke of York Islands during a search effort that began last week, report the BBC and Sydney Morning Herald. It was the first time the sub had been spotted since disappearing off Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, while carrying 35 crew members from Australia, New Zealand, and Britain on Sept. 14, 1914—roughly six weeks after the war broke out. There was no distress call, but its final communication put the sub in the general area in which it was found, the same area islanders had reported a  monster  appearing and then disappearing beneath the water.  The boat and her crew, who've been on eternal patrol since 1914 … have now been found,  Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne announced Thursday, per ABC Australia, calling it  one of the most significant discoveries in Australia's naval maritime history  and one that  will bring peace of mind to the family and descendants of the crew who lost their lives on board.  The search team held a short service to commemorate the crew members. The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea will now preserve the site, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, officials will try to determine why the 180-foot-long sub sank, apparently in one piece. The leading theory is that its pressure hull was punctured by a reef, as a small German survey ship was the only enemy vessel in the area at the time.

That's an increase of 35%, according to market research firm SNL Kagan, which says bundling TV, Internet, and phone services might be costing customers even more. People with bundled services are the steadiest customers cable companies have left as more young people decide to cut the cord. It's a fact not lost on the companies themselves.  The quickest way for cable companies to grow their revenue is charge more to the customers they already have,  one industry analyst tells NBC.  Ultimately, this may prove counterproductive.  This increase in costs coincides with increasing worries on the part of cable companies, NBC reports. The number of customers getting bundled services dropped for the first time in 2014. And only 47% of adults under 25 have bundled services. Sadly cost increases don't also mean improved services, thanks to cable company monopolies around the country. According to NBC, Internet service is more expensive in the US than Europe while speeds in major American cities lag far behind those in Seoul, Hong Kong, Paris, and more. Just something to remember if the next bill from your cable provider has suddenly climbed north of $160.","TV, Internet, Phone Prices Have Spiked in Last 5 Years","TV, Internet, Phone Prices Have Spiked in Last ____ Years",5,"Subtract( 2015 , 2010 )",1

"(Mar 16, 2017  8:45 PM CDT) At the cutting edge of medical science, stem cell therapy holds tremendous potential. But it's still relatively new, and it still needs to be studied vigorously for safety and efficacy as it pertains to a wide range of health issues. Two dramatically different new reports further highlight the need for more research and perhaps regulation, NPR reports. In the first, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers report on three elderly women who had stem cells derived from fat tissue injected directly into their eyes at a for-profit clinic in Florida in an attempt to treat macular degeneration. They each paid $5,000 for the unproven approach, meant to treat the most common cause of blindness in the elderly; instead, they went blind. One doctor warns that if something  sounds too good to be true,  it  may even be horrible.  In stark contrast, a study out of Japan, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reports on the promise of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which can be made using any cell in the body to create cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. Japanese researchers converted these stem cells into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which macular degeneration destroys, injected them into one eye of a patient, and found that the progression of the disease stopped altogether—a  really remarkable medical advance,  an outside researcher says. Other trials using iPE cells to treat diseases like Parkinson's will soon be underway, reports Science magazine, though a Japanese researcher cautions that diseases aren't likely to fully reverse:  Regenerative medicine is not going to cure patients in the way they hope.

The insiders say David Pecker, CEO of Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. and an associate of President Trump, had reservations about the deal with Michael Sanchez but eventually approved a $200,000 payday, which is more than the tabloid usually pays sources. General counsel Cameron Stracher, however, ended up resigning on the spot during an angry lunch meeting with Pecker in which the CEO expressed outrage that Sanchez was being paid up front, the sources say. The Enquirer generally doesn't pay sources until stories are published, and the Sanchez deal—which also made sure it wasn't a  catch and kill  situation— reflected the significance American Media placed on Mr. Sanchez’s information,  the Journal's sources say. Michael Sanchez, a talent agent with longstanding ties to the Enquirer, tells the Journal that its story is based on  old rumors.  He declined to say whether he had provided the tabloid with photos of Bezos, but denied giving it  penis selfies.

The New York Daily News reports the  Pharma Bro,   international villain,  and  most hated person in America  was sentenced to seven years in prison for securities fraud Friday. The 34-year-old Shkreli will get credit for the six months he's already served after having his bail revoked in September for offering $5,000 for a sample of Hillary Clinton's hair, according to the Washington Post. Shkreli was found guilty in August of defrauding investors in his hedge fund. But it was hiking the price of an HIV drug by 5,000% that first garnered him headlines. Since then he's been kicked off Twitter for threatening a journalist, been the subject of a satirical musical, fought with rappers, and called federal prosecutors  imbeciles.  Prior to his sentencing, a crying Shkreli, who one excused juror called  the face of corporate greed in America,  begged Judge Kiyo Matsumoto for  your honor's mercy,  ABC News reports.

Her campaign released figures showing her compensation for around 50 cases she was involved with while teaching at Harvard and other universities, reports the Wall Street Journal. The move comes amid a dispute over transparency and potential conflicts of interest with rival Pete Buttigieg.

IGN rounds up rumors about the new system: It could cost between $350 and $400; one of the names being tossed around is  Stream ; and it is expected to look like a modern Super Nintendo Entertainment System and be about the size of the original Xbox 360.

"(Mar 20, 2013  6:36 PM CDT) A Utah realtor born with the unassuming name of Herbert Streicher died this week of pancreatic cancer at age 65, but it's what he did before real estate that makes the obit notable. Streicher took the acting name of Harry Reems and starred in more than 100 adult films, none more memorable than 1972's Deep Throat, reports the New York Daily News. In fact, it was that film that led to Reems' other claim to fame: The feds went after him on obscenity charges—along with the mobsters reputed to have financed the film—and won a conviction. That made Reems the only actor to be convicted of obscenity charges, though famed attorney Alan Dershowitz later got it overturned, notes the Huffington Post. After his porn career, Reems turned into an alcoholic but eventually found sobriety, and his wife, in Park City, Utah, where he became a successful realtor.

"(Apr 26, 2017  6:50 PM CDT) Brennan Agranoff is the founder and CEO of a custom sock business that receives about 100 new orders per day—and he's just 17. Agranoff first came up with the idea for HoopSwagg when he was at a high school basketball game at age 13 and noticed all the boring athletic socks players were wearing; the company makes socks and other products, including shoelaces and arm sleeves, for basketball and other sports. Designs range from fairly standard (digital camo) to pretty out-there (unicorns farting rainbows).  My ideas, they're either really random or based on what is happening right now,  the Oregon high school junior, who has come up with more than 500 designs so far, tells KATU. The company's annual sales are more than $1 million, CNN Money reports. Agranoff has a number of part-time employees, and his mom works for the business full-time. One of his most popular designs involves pictures of the goats his family owns; Agranoff still has normal family chores, including feeding those goats, as well as his schoolwork. None of that stops him from working around 5 to 6 hours a day, he says. He taught himself how to code and do graphic design, and his parents were the first investors in his business, which he now runs from a 1,500-square-foot building on his family's property. Last week, HoopSwagg announced that it had purchased another custom athletic apparel company, its first acquisition. Agranoff plans to go to college eventually, but first he will work for his company full-time after graduating from high school six months early; he'd like to sell his products in brick-and-mortar stores. A pair of socks will run you $14.99. Agranoff hopes to someday allow customers to come up with their own designs.

"(Nov 22, 2016  6:55 PM) A group of notable academics believes it's found  persuasive evidence  that something is fishy with the presidential votes in three swing states, and it's encouraging Hillary Clinton to ask for a recount, New York Magazine reports. The group, which isn't going on the record at the moment, includes  prominent computer scientists and election lawyers.  In Wisconsin, the group found Clinton got 7% fewer votes in counties that used voting machines instead of paper ballots or optical scanners. The group estimates hacking or vote manipulation in those counties may have cost Clinton 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. The group says there's also evidence of possible vote tampering in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Clinton would need all three of those states to win the electoral college. The group of academics is pushing for an independent review of votes in those three states—especially in light of Russia's hack of the DNC—something that the White House is against. The Clinton camp was informed of the evidence last week but hasn't publicly commented. They have until Friday to ask for a recount in Wisconsin; deadlines in Michigan and Pennsylvania are next week. Meanwhile, NPR reports Clinton's lead in the popular vote is 1.75 million and growing.

As the Sacramento Bee reports, at the heart of the allegations is 56-year-old Orville Fleming, a former CalFire battalion chief and fire academy instructor who in May was charged in the grisly murder of 26-year-old Sarah Douglas, a former escort and Fleming's live-in girlfriend. Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan, at the time told Sacramento County sheriffs that she had seen a video of Douglas having sex with her husband and other firefighters aboard firetrucks. CalFire asked the California Highway Patrol to investigate. And while a CalFire rep says  allegations of a sex tape are unfounded,  and that the suspensions were due to  a variety of policy violations unrelated to allegations of a sex tape,  the full results of the CHP investigation won't be released until early January, notes the AP. Meagan Fleming further alleged that Orville Fleming and other firefighters had sex with prostitutes on firetrucks; a CalFire rep calls that determination  something we are waiting for  from the investigation.

Because that's exactly what he's done by giving Medicare Advantage a stay of execution, according to Benjamin Sasse and Charles Hurt of the New York Post. The law, they explain,  guts  the market-oriented Medicare alternative, reducing its reimbursement rates to drive people into Medicare proper. Seniors will have to pick a plan in October—just weeks before the election.  Nothing is more politically volatile than monkeying with the health insurance of seniors,  they write.  This could make the Tea Party look like a tea party.  Obama's solution? He's temporarily extending the program with billions taken from a Health and Human Services slush fund intended to pay for  experiments  in improving costs or care.

But after 31 years of using Snoopy & Co. in its advertising, the life insurance business is parting ways with the characters, the Wall Street Journal reports. MetLife first began using the Charles Schulz cartoons in an attempt to connect with US customers, but next year, the company will be spinning off much of its US life insurance business into a company called Brighthouse Financial, and from there on out MetLife will mostly only sell to corporate clients in the US.  We brought in Snoopy over 30 years ago to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant,  says a MetLife exec in a statement, per USA Today. MetLife spoke to more than 55,000 customers in eight countries as it decided on a new marketing approach; its new logo will feature a blue and green  M  symbol and the tagline,  MetLife: Navigating life together.  Snoopy won't disappear immediately; MetLife acknowledges it may take some time to get the characters off of all the materials, including notepads and business cards, on which they appear. As for the blimps, after this year MetLife won't be using them at all.  We have great respect for these iconic characters,  the exec says.  However, as we focus on our future, it's important that we associate our brand directly with the work we do and the partnership we have with our customers.

The proposed settlement resolves the department's civil and criminal probes of Transocean's role in the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster. It requires the Switzerland-based company to pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties and plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of violating the Clean Water Act, according to a court filing. The deal, which is subject to a federal judge's approval, also calls for Transocean to implement a series of operational safety and emergency response improvements on its rigs.

And no one initially disputed the Sudanese immigrant's age of 17—until apparently this week, when the basketball star was found to probably be a 30-year-old man and arrested for allegedly violating the country's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nicola, who had his first detention review Tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in Canada from Sudan in November, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life.  I don't know how many of [my friends] have a clue of how it is in Africa,  he had told the Star back in January. But during his five-month stint on the school's basketball team, his size raised eyebrows.

Basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone.

Now a treasure hunter from Argentina hopes it's also still home to more than $1 billion in gold coins, reports the London Times—half of which he could be entitled to. Ruben Collado also thinks the ship is stocked with the likes of rum, opium, and silk, and he plans to prove it by raising the vessel next month. Collado himself found the ship by accident in 2004, just 380 yards off the coast and 16 feet underwater. (Spaniards had pinned it under rocks to keep it submerged). The shallow depth is what gave up its location: Collado's vessel struck its mast in the River Plate estuary, reported AFP. He then waited more than a decade for Uruguay's permission to salvage it. The Lord Clive went down during a military mission amid the Seven Years' War, in which British and Portugal were trying to take the city of Colonia del Sacramento. Collado thinks the 64-gun ship, which belonged to the British East India Company, made the fatal error of anchoring too close to shore, within range of Spanish cannons. The Feb. 10 operation is expected to cost about $5 million for the team of 80 divers, technicians, and other support staff to raise the ship. The hope is that it can shed more light on British naval expeditions in South America.  The rescue of the ship would have an impact on the city no less important than when UNESCO declared it, justly, a World Heritage Site,  says Colonia's director of tourism.

The nearly 250-page document from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure lays out design, regulatory, and management missteps and  disturbing cultural issues,  including placing  undue pressure  on employees. The two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, and which prompted the grounding of the plane in March of last year,  were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA,  the report reads. The Democrat-led committee's report, which the New York Times says came from 600,000 pages of records and interviews with dozens of Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration workers, accuses the FAA of not stepping in enough to provide oversight, and Boeing of prioritizing profits over safety—specifically so that it could stay on top of rival Airbus, which had a competing aircraft. In a statement cited by CNN, Boeing responded to the report by saying it has  learned many hard lessons as a company  and that once regulators give the plane the OK to fly again,  we have full confidence in its safety.

These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as  a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves.  The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prize—but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy.

When I got up the next morning and looked at my dad, his hair was gray. It was brown the day before,  says Minnick, now 82.  Many people say that's not possible, but that's what I remember. That's how upset we were.  One by one, Robert V. Witt's family members died not knowing what exactly became of the 20-year-old Army corporal from Bellflower, Calif. Should Minnick ever meet them again, she can finally put the mystery to rest. Found in North Korea and identified last month, Witt's remains were returned to Minnick early last week and will be buried with full military honors at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier on Friday, reports the Long Beach Press-Telegram. Witt, a soldier with Task Force Faith, was among those attacked by Chinese forces at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November 1950. US troops adjusted their position on Dec. 1, and Witt was reported MIA a day later. US soldiers returned in POW exchanges in 1953 told officials that Witt had been captured and died of malnutrition around Jan. 31, 1951, but his remains weren't returned after the war. Around 2000, however, US and North Korean officials uncovered remains near Hwaong-Ri Village. Among the bones recovered, plus those found in 208 boxes sent to the US from 1990 to 1994, were two femur bones with DNA matching samples supplied by Witt's mother and brothers.  My mom didn't think she would be alive to hear the news,  says Minnick's daughter.  I am so happy,  Minnick adds.

A plane was grounded in Vienna for six hours as the airline forced passengers to come up with an additional $31,000. Apparently charter airline Comtel is in financial trouble and hadn’t paid  landing fees or taxes,  one passenger tells the Telegraph—which puts the amount raised at closer to $38,000.

"(Jun 8, 2017  7:40 AM CDT) A federal jury in Milwaukee has awarded $6.7 million to a former inmate who charged she was repeatedly raped by a jail guard while she was pregnant, the Milwaukee Sentinel-Journal reports. The woman filed a civil lawsuit alleging the guard, Xavier Thicklen, began assaulting her shortly after she was locked up in early 2013. Then 19, the woman identified only as  Jane Doe  was in the early stages of pregnancy when she said Thicklen raped her at various spots in the jail.  He used his keys, his power, his authority to get in these places and rape me,  she testified earlier in the trial, per the Sentinel-Journal. Officials in Milwaukee County plan to appeal the verdict. The county is liable for the payout since Thicklen was a public employee on the clock at the time of the assaults. The jury declined to award the woman compensation for being shackled during labor—she gave birth to a healthy baby girl—which her legal team claimed violated her constitutional rights. A midwife testified the restraints could slow labor and endanger the child. Prosecutors dropped four sexual assault charges against Thicklen, now 28, after he agreed to plead guilty to felony misconduct in November 2014, per Fox6. Sentenced to three days in jail, he was given credit for time served. The victim testified the assaults still bring on nightmares.  She sought justice and she is glad the system delivered that justice,  her lawyer tells the Sentinel-Journal.

A Victorian Supreme Court justice has determined that Bauer, publisher of Australia's Woman's Day magazine, owes the actress $3.6 million,  the highest defamation payout in Australian legal history,  reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Wilson, 37, tweeted Wednesday that the sum—including $522,000 in general damages and $3.1 million in special damages, per CNN—is actually four times the Australian record. She added she's  extremely grateful  and—following up on a promise to donate any damages—said she would support charities and the film industry in her native country. The Pitch Perfect star had initially offered to settle the case for $200,000, but later sought about $5.6 million. Her lawyer said that was a  conservative  amount considering Wilson lost out on roles in at least two films because of the 2015 articles painting her as a serial liar.  Wilson's reputation as an actress of integrity was wrongly damaged in a manner that affected her marketability in a huge worldwide marketplace,  Justice John Dixon said in announcing the damages Wednesday, per the BBC.

Colorado has enacted a few minor restrictions on guns since 1999—it's harder to carry concealed weapons, there are regulations on selling firearms at gun shows, and it's illegal to make  straw man  purchases for people who could not legally buy guns otherwise—but the state mostly prohibits local governments from restricting gun rights. Experts are, unsurprisingly, divided whether this latest example of gun violence will change anything. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have called for tighter gun controls. But just as Columbine and the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords caused few major changes, many think this latest tragedy will also do little to shake up the status quo.

The giant chipmaker made the announcement Tuesday as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world's leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing.  It's time to make this transition,  CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts  difficult,  he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for  cloud computing  data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices, and drones.  We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,  he said in a statement.

He was allegedly beaten into a confession, subjected to a trial his parents couldn't attend, and executed by gunshot without their knowledge seven months later. Now, 21 years after that, China's supreme court has declared Nie Shubin, just 20 years old at the time of his death, innocent. CNN calls it  a landmark case that exposed deep flaws in China's criminal justice system,  where 99.93% of cases ended with a conviction in 2013. In their ruling, the judges noted that Nie was made a suspect  without a shred of evidence  and that the time and cause of death and murder weapon couldn't be verified, reports the AP.

Though the Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia 15 years ago, the Telegraph reports that a double euthanasia such as this is rare.

Her disappearance was noted quickly, and the game was stopped while her family and others looked for her. Twenty-five minutes later, her body was found in a creek behind the school. An autopsy confirmed Doolin's death as a homicide, but a cause of death has not been released, WKRN reports.

"(Jul 12, 2012  6:49 AM CDT) An avalanche in the French Alps killed nine climbers and left another four or five missing this morning, the Telegraph reports. Two groups comprised of 28 climbers, many of them highly experienced, were trying to climb Mont Blanc, the highest peak in Europe. The avalanche hit as they were ascending Mont Maudit—the third highest peak in the range; its name ominously translates to  cursed peak.  The groups were taking a difficult route, via Mont Maudit as well as Mont du Tacul, Sky News reports; it is considered to be one of Europe's most dangerous climbs. Most of the climbers were roped together when the slide occurred around 5am, with no avalanche warnings issued beforehand. The mayor of nearby Chamonix calls it the  deadliest snow slide in recent years,  and a colonel notes that officials are  extremely concerned  for the safety of the missing climbers. Twelve injured people were evacuated and taken to nearby hospitals. The Mont Blanc range is one of the world's deadliest, regularly claiming the lives of more than 100 climbers per year.",9 Killed in Mont Blanc Avalanche,____ Killed in Mont Blanc Avalanche,9,Trans( nine ),1
"(Jan 9, 2016  2:35 PM) Walter Cavanagh of Santa Clara, Calif., holds the Guinness Book of World Records title of  Mr. Plastic Fantastic,  and Money revisited his story earlier this week. As it recounts, Cavanagh has 1,497 valid credit cards, adding up to $1.7 million in available credit. The wild stats don't end there: His custom wallet, the world's longest, stretches 250 feet, weighs 38 pounds, and can hold only 800 of his many cards, not that he carries them around: The Los Angeles Times reported in a 2004 profile that all but one (which he uses and pays off in full in each month, giving him nearly perfect credit) are kept in a safe-deposit box. Cavanagh's card collection started as  silly bet  with a friend nearly half a century ago. Whoever collected the most cards by the end of the year would win a dinner. The final score: 143-138 in Cavanagh's favor. With credit cards from gas stations, airlines, and an ice cream store, Cavanagh says he's only been denied credit once, by the now-defunct JJ Newberry Co., which said he had too much credit already. To maintain his title (which he's held since 1971, per ABC News), Cavanagh has to keep amassing cards. If a card isn't valid any more, he doesn't count it as part of his collection. Cavanagh isn't the only collector of plastic. The American Credit Card Collectors Society was formed in 1994 and holds regular conventions. But 29% of Americans actually have no plastic, per an April 2014 Gallup survey cited by MarketWatch. A third of us have one or two, and only 7% have seven or more.

Jori Lirette was bludgeoned, decapitated, and dismembered. His father, 30-year-old Jeremiah Lee Wright, said he left the little boy's head along the side of the road in Thibodaux where his mother would see him, reports the Daily Comet.

Tearful mom Jesslyn Lirette said at a police news conference that the boy was  my star,  and that Jori loved his father  more than anything.  A friend of Wright's said there was friction between the couple because Lirette left Wright to take care of Jori most of the time.  She would take off and totally expect Jerry to do everything,  he said. The dad killed the boy when Lirette left to fix their truck so she could take Jori to the doctor the next day, said cops.

Also out from Amazon today: 8-inch ($150) and 10-inch ($230) Fire HD tablets, as well as an updated kid's tablet ($100) and new versions of Fire TV ($100; $130 for the gaming model). Built into all the new tablets is Amazon's OS 5 (aka  Bellini), which the company's senior manager of Fire tablets calls Amazon's  biggest redesign ever,  per PC World. The new OS includes the Word Runner reading program, designed to help consumers speed-read by showing words one at a time in the center of the screen (it sounds odd, but here's a neat video demo). What makes the company's tablet push somewhat unexpected is that it hasn't exactly been a leader in that market: Per IDC data cited by Fortune, Amazon didn't even break into the top five of worldwide tablet vendors in the second quarter of 2015, and sales of the iPad put out by competitor Apple have declined as of late. But with the new OS' splashy interface and instant-download features for Amazon Prime members, Amazon hopes to not only steal some of Apple's thunder, but also lure more consumers to its online store, the AP notes.

"(Apr 9, 2014  12:53 PM CDT) If you could be anywhere in the world right now, Gothenburg, Sweden, may be the perfect place. That's because the town's government is initiating a pretty appealing sounding experiment: testing a 30-hour workweek, in which workers will be paid as if they're working full-time. The hope is that the six-hour days will bump up mental and physical well-being, increasing efficiency while reducing the number of sick days that are taken. The deputy mayor says the plan has been in the works for a while, though the opposition is dismissing it as a political ploy ahead of 2014 elections. Regardless, it's going forward, with a somewhat scientific approach involving control and test groups. One unlucky department will stick with its regular schedule; the Independent reports by way of Sweden's Metro newspaper that the elderly care department will drop to 30 hours per week for a year, then the results will be compared. The Local reports that the mayor says a car factory in town recently tried the six-hour day, with positive results.

The acquisition is the largest ever for Stockholm-based Electrolux, ranked as the world's second-biggest home appliance-maker after US rival Whirlpool.

"(Jan 13, 2016  10:15 AM) With talk of reforming the criminal justice system gaining steam, a writer at Democracy makes the case for a controversial idea: maximum sentences of 20 years for nearly all prisoners. Lots of attention has been paid to the long mandatory sentences doled out to nonviolent drug offenders, but Marc Mauer argues that those convicted of violent crimes shouldn't be spending most of their lives behind bars, either. The idea  is grounded in both humanitarian and public-safety concerns,  he writes, noting that inmates often  age out  of the criminal mindset. And from a more practical point of view, it's expensive to care for older prisoners, all the more so given that most of them pose little danger to society. No other industrialized country keeps so many people behind bars for so long, he writes.  The excessively lengthy incarceration of offenders—yes, even for violent crimes—is counterproductive, costly, and inhumane,  writes Mauer.  To remedy this problem, Congress and state legislative bodies should establish an upper limit of 20 years in prison as a maximum penalty, except in unusual cases such as a serial rapist who has not been amenable to treatment in prison or a mass murderer.  Review boards made up of psychologists and other experts could assess inmates at the 20-year mark to determine whether it makes sense to keep them locked up. Because, yes, that violent 18-year-old may indeed pose a danger to society on the day of his sentencing, but who can say what he'll be like 20 years down the road?

CNN reports that a Vietnamese couple had their 2-year-old twins genetically tested after family members kept harping about how different the children looked. What the Center for Genetic Analysis and Technologies in Hanoi discovered: The twins are bi-paternal, meaning they share only a mother. The revelations about the family pretty much end there. The twins' gender was not revealed, and the only identifying details given by Vietnam's state-run news agency VNS is that the children have very different hair (thick and wavy vs. thin and straight) and live in Hoa Binh province with their 34-year-old father and mother, whose age wasn't given. Le Dinh Luong, president of the Genetic Association of Vietnam, says he's unaware of any case like this in his country. That hasn't stopped paranoid fathers from phoning the Hanoi center over fears about their twins, reports the Tuoi Tre paper. It's rare, but certainly not unheard of in the US. Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled a man is father to one twin while another man is father to the other, in a case that had child-support implications. The judge in that case cited two other similar court cases, and a 1997 article by identity testing expert Karl-Hans Wurzinger, who testified in the case, put the number of reported paternity cases involving superfecundation (the fathering of fraternal twins by two males) at one in every 13,000.
