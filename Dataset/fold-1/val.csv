"(Sep 25, 2016  1:28 PM CDT) Authorities say seven people have been injured in an apparent fight in Boston's Theater District, the AP reports. The Boston Globe reports that Bernard O'Rourke, police superintendent of the bureau of field services, said officers responded to a report of a fight about 2:15am Sunday in the district, where bars and restaurants cater to nightlife crowds and had just closed. Police say people were stabbed with knives or bottles. Four of the victims were transported to receive medical treatment, while the other three walked into hospitals on their own, a police spokesman tells the Globe. Another police spokesman on Sunday afternoon told the AP the injuries appear to be non-life-threatening; earlier reports had said one person was critically injured. O'Rourke has said a suspect has been IDed—and per RT.com, that suspect was one of the wounded. Police are said to be seeking a second suspect. Emerson College, which has facilities in the area, alerted students to the incident in a Facebook post. The school has asked students to report any suspicious activity.

"(Jul 2, 2019  4:44 PM CDT) In 1979, the members of U2 were still in their teens when they performed at the Dandelion Market in Dublin. The guitarist of the band that opened for them was so impressed with their talent that he recorded their show on cassette tapes, explains Rolling Stone. Lo and behold, those tapes have now surfaced as the earliest known live recording of U2, according to the encyclopedic band site ATU2. The tapes have not been released, but you can hear samples of two songs— In Your Hand  and  Concentration Cramp.   I am pleased that I recorded the show,  Pete McCluskey tells ATU2,  and hadn’t realized the significance of it and its place in history until quite recently.  For the record, his band was named The Stougers.  They were just 17, 18, and a couple of years younger than myself and my band colleagues,  McCluskey recalls of U2. But his band had opened for them once before, and he made a point to bring his recorder to the next gig. The show catches U2  at a pivotal point in their development,  writes Andy Greene of Rolling Stone. Neither of two songs released in part have been heard before, though  Concentration Cramp  appears to have been a precursor to  Live My Life Tonight,  released later.

A family friend tells the New York Times US authorities confirmed the 28-year-old's death. Shabazz was a troubled figure from childhood, the Times notes; he pleaded guilty at age 12 to having set a fire that resulted in his grandmother's death, though he later told the Amsterdam News he was innocent. He spent four years in jail; following his release, he was jailed again for attempted robbery. A witness at the arson trial called him  a schizophrenic boy of a paranoid type.

"(Sep 19, 2016  3:14 PM CDT) Not everyone was swept up by Royal Baby fever back in 2013, but not everyone lost their job for ignoring the birth of Prince George, either. A little bit of satisfaction and about $65,000 now belongs to Chandana Keerthi Bandara, a former producer for the BBC's Sri Lankan news service who was fired after he opted to not cover the birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton's first child when he came to work the day after the blessed event, prioritizing instead coverage of the 30th anniversary of Sri Lanka's Black July. Told to publish something about the wee Windsor child, Bandara initially refused, then put something up about noon. That earned him disciplinary proceedings, a verdict of gross misconduct, and a final written warning, reports the Telegraph. When another allegation was made a year later, Bandara was sent packing after 18 years on the job. He sued the BBC for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination, and a tribunal has now found that that final written warning was unfair and contributed to his firing, though no racial discrimination occurred.  The BBC takes disciplinary matters very seriously and we are disappointed with the outcome of this unfair dismissal claim,  a rep tells the Independent, which notes the rep  could not specify why  the BBC was disappointed.

"(Feb 20, 2014  6:59 PM) A mother in Washington state rescued her three young children from a house fire before firefighters arrived at the scene, reports KREM. It's all the more remarkable because her husband was one of those firefighters rushing to get there. The drama began Tuesday night when Rachelle Flatt of Spokane Valley put her three kids to bed about 9:30, noticed flames on the patio, and called 911, reports KHQ. Then came the explosion—flames ignited a propane tank, and the blast sent smoke and flames into the home. Flatt first got her 3-year-old girl out the front door and into the hands of neighbors, reports the Spokesman-Review. Then she went back and got her 15-month-old girl, and back a third time though the thick smoke to get her 6-year-old boy.  That’s when I really started to panic,  she says.  I was running out of air.  She made it, though, with husband Pete on the way with his fellow firefighters.  My heart just dropped,  he recalls, upon hearing the address. The house suffered heavy damage, but it was insured. The one sad note was the death of faithful Hank the Tank, one of the family's dogs.

"(Aug 3, 2019  1:52 PM CDT) A suspect is in custody after a mass shooting left 20 people dead at a Texas Walmart on Saturday, the New York Times reports. Police say a gunman entered the store with an AK-47-style rifle and opened fire just before 11am, injuring 26 others and causing general panic before giving himself up to police. Officials are considering capital murder charges for the man in custody, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, and are reading an anti-immigrant manifesto to see whether the gunman wrote it—which could turn the massacre into a terrorist act or federal hate crime.  Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs,  reads the manifesto, which says more Hispanics will make Texas  a Democrat stronghold.  Over 1,000 customers and 100 employees were in the store at the time, including children holding a fundraiser, who were among those shot by the gunman, the El Paso Times reports.  We heard shots and saw smoke,  says an eyewitness who works at McDonald's in the store.  I saw a man on the floor full of blood.

"(Dec 29, 2020  9:45 AM) With the governor's executive order barring most evictions due to expire at year's end, the New York Legislature called a special session Monday to pass  one of the most comprehensive anti-eviction laws in the nation,  per the New York Times. The bill, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately signed, bars landlords from evicting most tenants for 60 days, protects landlords who own 10 or fewer apartments from foreclosure, and automatically renews tax exemptions for elderly or disabled homeowners. Protections are extended until May 1 for tenants who cite financial hardship tied to the coronavirus pandemic or a significant health risk related to a move, per Fox News. Up to 1.2 million New York households are at risk of losing their homes, according to consulting firm Stout, per the Times. In signing a $900 billion relief package on Sunday, President Trump approved $1.3 billion in rent relief for New Yorkers and stretched out a federal eviction moratorium. But state legislators took further action, as some argue the requirements for federal eviction protection are too rigid. Evictions can still proceed in cases where a judge finds tenants have repeatedly faced nuisance complaints, such as for noise. But that's not enough for some landlord groups, who argue tenants don't need to provide proof of hardship.  The cost of providing free housing cannot be fully borne by property owners,  says Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, per Politico. Meanwhile, the Housing Justice for All coalition has called on lawmakers to  clear the back rent owed by New Yorkers and create a hardship fund for small landlords.",New York Halts Most Evictions for 2 Months
"(May 23, 2014  3:57 PM CDT) A Navy warship has located the overturned hull of a British yacht that went missing last week 1,000 miles off the Massachusetts coast, but there's no sign of the ship's four crew members. A helicopter from the warship spotted the hull today, and a small boat crew confirmed it bore the name of the 40-foot Cheeki Rafiki. A Navy swimmer found the boat's cabin was flooded and its windows shattered. The swimmer also knocked on the hull and reached below the waterline with no results. Unless new sightings suggest the crew members might be alive, the search will be called off as scheduled at 10pm Eastern. The Cheeki Rafiki had been returning to England from a regatta in Antigua when it reported trouble on May 15.

"(Mar 14, 2012  3:00 AM CDT) A strong earthquake shook northern Japan last night, causing small tidal changes on its Pacific coastline; no damage or injury was reported. Several towns issued evacuation orders or advisories to residents nearest the coast. A swelling of 8 inches was observed in the port of Hachinohe in Aomori, northern Japan, about one hour after the quake struck the region. The agency lifted all tsunami advisories about an hour and half later. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the tremor was 6.8 magnitude; an aftershock of magnitude 5.9 struck followed about two hours later. The town of Otsuchi in Iwate prefecture, where more than 800 died in last year's tsunami, issued an evacuation order to all households along the coast as a precaution. Yesterday's tremor was centered about 146 miles south of Kushiro, on Hokkaido island. It was a relatively shallow 6 miles below the sea surface.

"(Aug 7, 2013  10:14 AM CDT) A new study throws the whole concept of a  due date  into question, finding the length of pregnancy can naturally vary by as much as five weeks. The study of 125 women expands upon what the BBC reports are some fairly broad stats: Only 4% of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30% do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As LiveScience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. (The average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. The study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant.  The emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is,  says a study researcher. The upshot? Perhaps a  delivered by  date would be better than a  due date,  suggests a spokesperson for the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.","9 Months May Not Be 'Normal' Pregnancy, After All"

"(Sep 29, 2010  3:12 AM CDT) The Northern lights are rarer now than they have been for at least a century, but some spectacular light shows are probably on the way, researchers say. The phenomenon, triggered by solar winds, usually follows an 11-year cycle, rising quickly to a maximum before tapering off to a minimum. But researchers say the minimum has been  going on and on and on  since 2008, the Telegraph reports. A research station near the North Pole which observed the blaze of light in the skies almost nightly during the cycle's peak saw it less than half the time this year.

Another poll discovered that 71% of voters want smaller government, but  vast majorities oppose cuts to Medicare (81%), Social Security (78%), and Medicaid (70%).  There is hope: As one professor's experiments in  deliberative democracy  show,  people start out with deep value disagreements over, say, government spending,  but  tend to agree on rational policy responses once they learn the ins and outs of the budget.

But they also said they were made scapegoats, saying that they didn't think their barbecue was the only source of the forest fire. And their lawyer questioned why the forestry service would impose such a large fine  knowing that these two kids, who are still students, cannot pay it.

A new UN report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found  it is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010.  That  extremely likely  is important, the New York Times reports—it means the scientists are now 95% to 100% sure global warming is our fault. In the last UN report, they said they were 90% to 100% sure.

An increase like that wouldn't just threaten tiny islands—it could endanger London, Shanghai, Venice, Sydney, and New York, says the Times. However, the scientists warn, because the report won't be published for another month, people should take what they read with a grain of salt.

Some 152,000 of them had to find an alternate way to get to class in the freezing rain this morning, amid a school-bus drivers strike, reports the NY Daily News. Schools issued MetroCards to affected students so they could take public transportation, and parents who opt to pay for a taxi or drive their kids can fill out forms for reimbursement. But some worry that kids with special needs—more than a third of the children affected—will fall through the cracks, and parents of young students won't receive MetroCards allowing them to escort their kids until tomorrow. The strike, the first since the 1970s, could last for days or months, as no negotiations have yet been scheduled between the striking bus driver's union and city officials. The dispute centers around new contracts for certain bus routes that the city plans to bid out in an attempt to cut costs. The union called for a strike, fearing current drivers could wind up jobless when their contracts expire in June, reports NBC 4 New York.

It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess,  the Chinese tech billionaire said Tuesday. He addressed the jobs plan, made after he met with then president-elect Donald Trump in January 2017, on Wednesday:  This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis. This promise can't be completed.  CNN provides background, explaining Ma's  vague promise  didn't involve building Alibaba facilities in the US, but rather by helping fire up small US businesses by enabling them to better tap into the Chinese market. The Wall Street Journal also uses the word  vague  to describe how critics viewed Ma's pledge, observing that, nearly two years later, Alibaba hasn't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far. Count the Washington Post among those critics. It points out that based on Commerce Department figures, 1 million new American jobs would require that US exports to China rise by an additional $206 billion a year.

"(Dec 26, 2015  5:12 PM) Another school lesson has ended poorly, this time in Texas. Houston's Ed White Elementary School held a Multicultural Day earlier this month, with the school explaining via email that the kids would learn about cultures in places ranging from Spain to Israel. The email, in parentheses, stated that the children  will be doing henna,  a plant-based dye that's traditionally painted on the body in India, reports Click2Houston. Tammy Samour's husband read the email and didn't know what henna was. He does now. Tammy Samour, who didn't read the email, says she's outraged after her 7-year-old Leah came home from school with henna tattoos on her hands.  Somebody tattooed my daughter without my permission.  Samour is particularly incensed because the activity occurred the week before Christmas week.  We have family photos, opening presents, church, and she is going to be wearing that on her hands throughout the holiday.  KHOU reports the Clear Creek Independent School District offered to Photoshop Leah's hands in those holiday photos, but that wasn't enough to appease Samour.  Exploring other cultures is a wonderful thing. But tattooing another culture's expressions on my daughter is not acceptable. It's upsetting to go through Christmas with another religion's celebratory symbolism all over my daughter's hands.  The district says it regrets not spelling out what henna is in the email, and says it will  certainly will do a better job in the future to make sure that parents are informed.",7-Year-Old's Henna Tattoo a Big Problem for Mom
"(Nov 26, 2013  6:03 PM) A strange case is playing out in Israel over a woman's refusal to circumcise her son. In what Haaretz calls a  precedent-setting decision,  a rabbinical court has levied a fine of $140 a day for each day she does not circumcise him. The bill is currently at $700, but the unidentified woman refuses to budge.  I have no right to cut his organ and mutilate him,  she told Channel 2, as reported by the Times of Israel.  And the court has no right to force me to do so.  The court, however, says that  circumcision is a standard surgical procedure that is performed on every Jewish baby boy, so when one of the parents demands it, the other cannot delay it.  And that's where things get a little confusing. The child's parents are going through a divorce, and the mother says her soon-to-be ex initially agreed with the decision to leave the boy uncircumcised but changed his mind during the divorce proceedings. In its ruling against her, the court suggested this was part of a scheme of some sort on her part:  If the mother is given the opportunity to prevent the circumcision or use her objection [to the procedure] as a tool to make headway in the divorce struggle, we could find ourselves facing a flood of cases like these,  wrote the rabbis.  This trend must be stopped immediately.  Rabbinical courts have authority over all marriage issues, notes 972mag.com. But this one might well end up in the nation's Supreme Court.",Mom Fined $140 a Day for Not Circumcising Son

Jose Cruz  Chato  Romero-Flores, his girlfriend, and four male associates were arrested in a massive human trafficking sweep known as Operation No Boundaries, authorities announced. They're accused of luring women from Mexico and Latin America with promises of positions as cleaners or babysitters, then forcing them to be prostitutes in a New Jersey brothel instead, the Asbury Park Press reports. The Lakewood brothel, part of a network that ran through New York and New Jersey, charged men $30 per session, with each woman serving around 100 in a single six-day week.  They endured a miserable life,  the state attorney general says. Like many women caught in such human trafficking schemes,  they are fearful and they are vulnerable because of their illegal status.

It sounds absurd,  but when you think that you can make a delicious meal from two eggs, that's $1.50. It's really not that much when we think of how we waste money in our lives.  The problem is that  we've been conditioned by artificially cheap food to be shocked when a box of strawberries costs $3,  he says.  But it's important to know that farmers aren't getting wealthy. When you see strawberries being sold for $1 a box, picture the kind of labor it takes to pick those strawberries and the kind of chemicals it takes to produce those kinds of strawberries without hand weeding.

"(Apr 29, 2016  12:10 AM CDT) North Korea on Friday sentenced a US citizen of Korean heritage to 10 years in prison after convicting him of espionage and subversion, the second American it has put behind bars this year, the AP reports. Kim Dong Chul had been detained in the North on suspicion of engaging in spying and stealing state secrets. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labor after a brief trial in Pyongyang. North Korea's Supreme Court found Kim guilty of espionage and subversion under Articles 60 and 64 of the North's criminal code. When he was paraded before the media in Pyongyang last month, Kim said he had collaborated with and spied for South Korean intelligence authorities in a plot to bring down the North's leadership and had tried to spread religion among North Koreans before his arrest in the city of Rason last October. South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the country's main spy agency, has said Kim's case wasn't related to the organization in any way. Kim's sentencing comes on the heels of a 15-year sentence handed down on Otto Warmbier, an American university student who the North says was engaged in anti-state activities while visiting the country as a tourist earlier this year.",North Korea Gives US 'Spy' 10 Years Hard Labor

In the study of 75 sedentary adults with rheumatoid arthritis or knee osteoarthritis published in the Journal of Rheumatology, researchers found that subjects who practiced an hour of yoga three times a week for eight weeks enjoyed higher energy, less depression, reduced pain, and improved flexibility and walking ability, reports Time. Researchers pegged the improvement at 20% over those in the non-yoga control group and say the benefits were still evident nine months later. Lead author Susan Bartlett tells Medical Daily that one subject even went on to become a marathon runner. More than 95% of the study's subjects were female, but Bartlett tells the website that for the purposes of this study, it made sense: 70% of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers are women. One caveat, one of the researchers tells Time: Not all yoga classes are equal and could even harm arthritis patients, so he advises checking with one's doctor and seeking out the gentler regimens found in classes for older, disabled, or pregnant students before heading straight into Downward-Facing Dog.",Yoga 3 Times a Week Pays Big Dividends
"(Jul 27, 2011  6:17 AM CDT) There isn't enough evidence linking working at Ground Zero to cancer to justify compensating 9/11 responders for cancer treatments, a federal review has concluded. The benefits-providing Zadroga Act that was signed into law earlier this year requires periodic reviews of any evidence of cancer, the New York Times reports. But the report, released yesterday, noted that  drawing causal inferences about exposures resulting from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the observation of cancer cases in responders and survivors is especially challenging since cancer is not a rare disease.  The Times notes that one in two men and one in three women will develop cancer during their lives; such a high probability makes it tougher to prove the 9/11 link. But  so many people have gotten such rare cancers—and at such young ages—that it seems obvious there must be a link,  Sen. Charles Schumer said.  We believe this report is premature and that the framework established by the Zadroga bill will demonstrate that those who were exposed to the witches' brew of toxins at Ground Zero have developed serious illnesses, including cancer, and deserve justice.  The second review of cancer evidence will occur in the early part of next year.",No Benefits for 9/11 Responders With Cancer
"(Dec 12, 2016  8:54 AM) Can a whip as long as six football fields destroy some of the 500,000 pieces of space junk spinning around Earth at 17,500 miles per hour? Japan's space agency sure hopes so. JAXA launched its Kounotori 6 spacecraft on Friday with tons of supplies bound for the International Space Station, where it's expected to arrive on Wednesday, reports NPR. Also on board is a 2,300-feet electrodynamic tether, or EDT, made of aluminum and steel, in the works for more than a decade. JAXA says it will use an electric current and Earth's magnetic field to slow down debris and shove it out of orbit and toward Earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up. The EDT and the Kounotori, which will also carry waste from the ISS, will then meet the same fate. It's unclear how many pieces of space junk might be destroyed using the EDT, but this is mostly a test. If all goes well, JAXA plans to create a second tether up to six miles in length, reports Bloomberg. The BBC notes this is one of a few efforts underway to tackle space junk, which poses hazards for astronauts and their equipment. In May, for example, a tiny piece of space junk—possibly a speck of paint—chipped a window in the ISS' Cupola observatory, reports Christian Science Monitor. As the ISS wouldn't stand a chance against some debris as large as a bus, it has to be moved to avoid an impact, says project chief Koichi Inoue. Kounotori's EDT  is a promising candidate to deorbit the debris objects at low cost,  JAXA says. (You can now adopt space junk.)",Japan to Smack Space Junk With 2.3K-Foot Whip

Dr. Sean Conley was the one who made this year's assessment at the Walter Reed medical hospital, supervising the president's exam through four hours of poking, prodding, and testing Friday at the hands of nearly a dozen different specialists, the AP and CNN report.  While the reports and recommendations are being finalized, I am happy to announce the president of the United States is in very good health,  Conley noted in a statement. Conley added that he expected the president's health to remain this way  for the duration of his presidency, and beyond  (he didn't predict, however, that Trump, 72, might live for hundreds of years like Conley's predecessor, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, did last year).

Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds State Park has a slightly glitzier reputation, and the latest lucky visitor is a woman who says she asked God last Thursday,  Are you going to bless me and let me find a diamond today?  The answer, apparently, was a resounding yes: Not long after, Susie Clark spotted a teardrop-shaped 3.69-carat gem that she's dubbed the Hallelujah Diamond, per a park release.  The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent, metallic shine,  says Park Interpreter Waymon Cox, who adds that the pinto bean-sized diamond is the biggest gem of the 122 found so far this year at the park. But it pales slightly in comparison to a 6.19-carat whopper found a year ago, and it's less than a tenth the size of the biggest ever found there: a 40.23-carat gem named the Uncle Sam (that one was uncovered during a 1924 mining project; the site was converted into a state park in 1972). Cox adds Clark also likely had a little help from recent rain, which washes dirt away, leaving diamonds to sparkle in the sun. The park's searchable 37.5-acre field is also plowed by staff to assist diamond hunters; the field is the only such site open to the public in the world, and those who find a diamond are free to do what they wish with it.

Per LawNewz, TV weatherman Kyle Hunter, who hired the celebrity lawyer to represent him in his claim that CBS discriminated against him in favor of pretty young meteorologists, filed a legal malpractice and fraud suit against Allred on Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Hunter's specific beef: that Allred messed up key parts of his defense, and that she didn't clue him in that she and CBS were developing a legal drama based on her life, which he says is a conflict of interest. All of this led to  a near-seven-figure legal bill for Hunter, a sunk suit against CBS, and [his] impaired reputation,  per his complaint. (The suit, which is asking for $1 million in damages, was filed by a lawyer who contributes op-eds to LawNewz). In the suit, Hunter blasts Allred and other lawyers at her firm for not interviewing witnesses who may have helped his case, among other grievances. Per Variety, Hunter's suit says the $800,000 legal bill he had to pay when he lost to CBS left him near bankruptcy. LawNewz also uncovered in March that the State Bar of California is looking into Allred's actions for misconduct, for undisclosed reasons.

It won Oscars for best picture, director (Avildsen), and editing and was nominated for seven others. Rocky was a chance venture for Avildsen, reports the AP. Sylvester Stallone, then unknown, had written the script and sought Avildsen to direct it, but Avildsen was already working on another film. Suddenly the production company ran out of money and that film was canceled. A friend sent Avildsen the Rocky script.

The first time I showed it to 40 or 50 friends, they all freaked out, so that was encouraging,  he recalled.  But I guess when I saw the lines around the block, it began to take on a reality.

Ellis' manager, Emily Gerson Saines, confirmed the actor's death in an email Saturday. The Hollywood Reporter, which was first to report Ellis' death, quoted her as saying he died from complications of heart failure. The Illinois-born actor, who studied at Juilliard, played the role of Lafayette, a gay short order cook, on the HBO drama from 2008 to 2014, and more recently appeared in the CBS detective series Elementary.

He says two further installments of the manifesto will explain the 9/11 attacks and reveal  the truth about the so-called war on terror.  The Koran  forbids us to use force as a means of converting  others, and  truth and reality never comes by muscles and force but by using the mind and wisdom,  writes Mohammed, who is being kept in solitary confinement at Guantanamo Bay. How sincere is he? The manifesto suggest that he either believes he can convert American readers, or is  playing a mind game to attract publicity, feign mental illness, or spare himself the death penalty if convicted in the 2001 attacks,  decides the Los Angeles Times.",9/11 Mastermind Renounces Violence

"(Jun 9, 2015  12:02 PM CDT) CDC officials say a woman with an extremely rare form of tuberculosis came to the US from India and traveled to three different states before being diagnosed with an active case of the disease. Now she's isolated at a National Institutes for Health clinic in Maryland, and authorities are trying to track down  hundreds of people  who may have come into contact with her, NBC News reports. If it were just a simple case of TB, there wouldn't be such a brouhaha—but the unnamed patient has extensively drug-resistant TB, or XDR TB, which doesn't respond to some of the most powerful anti-TB drugs, per the World Health Organization. Although the disease is rare—the CDC says only 63 cases of it were noted between 1993 and 2011—TB bacteria can enter the air via coughs or sneezes and remain there for several hours, the agency notes. After spending time in India—the country with the largest number of TB cases in 2013, according to WHO—the woman flew back to Chicago in April, then traveled to Missouri and Tennessee over the next seven weeks, notes NBC. CNN points out as many as 8 weeks can pass between exposure and a positive TB test. A spokeswoman for the McHenry County Health Department in Illinois tells the Chicago Tribune it's keeping an eye on some people the woman was in close contact with and that the general public is likely not at risk. An NIH statement says the patient is being treated in a room  specifically designed for handling patients with respiratory infections, including XDR-TB,  per NBC; the CDC says she's in stable condition. The CDC reports only 30% to 50% of XDR TB cases can be cured, and treatment can take years, with doctors even performing surgery to remove infected areas.",Woman With Super-Rare TB Traveled to 3 States

We're going to have to build some kind of infrastructure so people can get around, whether it's highways or rail.  And on almost every measure,  he writes, the highway option  is the worse of the two.   Basic analyses showing relatively poor returns for HSR construction tend to make unrealistic assumptions,  he writes.

Per a National Park Service release, Bunker's body was spotted in a crevasse along the base of Liberty Ridge.  Unknown events caused his fall in steep, treacherous terrain,  the release notes. Sadly, Bunker's body is located in an area that neither ground nor air teams can reach, as falling rocks and ice would make such a rescue too perilous.

"(Jan 10, 2010  6:54 AM) Americans would see only a modest rise in health costs under the Senate's plan to extend coverage to 34 million people, government economic experts say in a new report. The study found that health spending, which accounts for about one-sixth of the economy, would increase by less than 1% than it otherwise would over the coming decade—even with so many more people receiving coverage. Over time, cost-cutting measures could reduce annual increases in health spending, offering substantial savings in the long run. At the same time, however, yesterday's report cited the tax on  Cadillac  health plans, as well as reductions in annual increases to Medicare providers, as having potential to hold down costs. But the authors were skeptical that Congress could stand the political fallout, noting that the Medicare cuts  may be unrealistic.",Health Costs Would Rise 1% Under Senate Bill

Among the potential reasons: Anal sex and a nude camping scene. The film, which intends to challenge homophobia and racism,  offends everybody,  said one exec.  But you laugh from the minute it starts.   With the quantity of material available, I cannot foresee a problem  downgrading the rating to R before the movie's July release, said a Universal spokesman. Insiders add Baron Cohen is still  finding the film,  and has tested two versions of it.

"(Dec 31, 2014  11:35 AM) In 2011, a passerby at a beach on the Gaspé peninsula in Quebec found partial skeletons whose mystery has, at least to some degree, been solved three years later. Among the remains were around a dozen long bones, pieces of a jawbone, and more than 25 vertebrae. Parks Canada anthropologists have determined that the bones belonged to three malnourished children from Europe, likely impoverished 19th-century Irish migrants who died in a shipwreck while trying to find a better life, the Globe and Mail reports.  They are witnesses to a tragic event,  says one archaeologist. Researchers found that the children likely ate a plant-based diet in Europe and that one child suffered from rickets, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, Archaeology reports. In addition, a button found nearby was linked to Europe in the 19th century. Officials believe they are likely victims of the wreck of the Carricks, a ship that crossed the Atlantic with Irish migrants trying to escape their homeland's famine only to sink in a storm in 1847. About 100 bodies washed ashore. There were 48 survivors, the CBC reported in 2012; they were taken in by local families. A memorial to the tragedy is just 40 yards away from where these children's bones were found. Says one local, who had ancestors among the shipwreck victims and survivors,  I have a link to these people—I almost consider them my family.  Thousands died on the Carricks and other  coffin ships  of the era, and the Washington Post notes that the sleeping quarters in such ships look similar to concentration camps.

The five were arrested yesterday after activists kicked off the weeklong unofficial referendum inspired by a similar vote in June in nearby Hong Kong that Beijing denounced as an illegal farce but which drew nearly 800,000 votes. Macau's government privacy watchdog had warned organizers they were violating privacy laws by collecting identity card data from voters. The arrests are  a serious violation of human rights,  says the president of Open Macau Society, one of three groups organizing the poll in the former Portuguese colony.  You can feel that how the government fears the result of the referendum.

"(Feb 27, 2009  8:09 AM) The US economy contracted at a staggering 6.2% pace at the end of 2008, the worst showing in more than a quarter-century, as consumers and businesses ratcheted back spending, plunging the country deeper into recession. That's drastically worse than the 3.8% the government originally estimated, and the 5.4% economists predicted. Looking ahead, economists predict consumers and businesses will keep cutting back spending, making the first six months of this year especially rocky. The new report offered grim proof that the economy's tailspin accelerated in the fourth quarter under a slew of negative forces feeding on each other. The economy started off 2008 on feeble footing, picked up a bit of speed in the spring, and then contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter. Before today's report was released, many were projecting an annualized drop of 5% this quarter.

"(Jun 25, 2020  11:45 AM CDT) The Trump administration has some lessons to learn before sending out any new coronavirus stimulus checks. More than 1 million checks for a combined $1.4 billion were distributed to dead people, according to a government watchdog report covering coronavirus relief spending approved by Congress as of April 30. In the rush to disburse $269 billion to 160.4 million people  as rapidly as possible,  as mandated by the Cares Act, Treasury officials followed procedures put in place for 2008 stimulus payments and  did not include using death records as a filter,  per NBC News. The Treasury doesn't have access to the Social Security Administration's full set of death records, as the IRS does, though it gained temporary access upon discovering that some payments were being made to dead people, reports the Washington Post. IRS officials raised concerns about the issue before payments were distributed to eligible Americans who'd filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return. But  counsel determined they did not have the legal authority to deny payments to people who had filed a return, even if they were deceased,  per the Post. On May 6, the IRS said payments to deceased or incarcerated individuals must be returned—but it doesn't yet have a plan in place for recouping the money, according to the Government Accountability Office report released Thursday. The IRS has now agreed to  consider cost-effective options for notifying ineligible recipients how to return payments,  as recommended in the report. Meanwhile, Congress is directed to grant Treasury access to the full set of death records and  require that Treasury consistently use it, to help reduce similar types of improper payments.",$1.4B in Stimulus Money Went to Dead People

"(Oct 13, 2015  7:00 AM CDT) A Dutch report on the MH17 crash concludes the plane was shot down by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile that struck the front left side of the plane near the cockpit, Dutch Safety Board Chairman Tjibbe Joustra said at a press conference on Tuesday. The report, the result of a 15-month-long investigation, notes the explosion sent thousands of metal objects in all directions and hundreds hit the plane with  tremendous force,  Joustra said, per the Guardian. He added shrapnel from the Buk missile was found inside the bodies of the pilots, who died instantly, along with traces of paint from a Buk missile. The BBC's Anna Holligan, who spoke to relatives briefed on the report, says all passengers and crew would've lost consciousness immediately as the plane broke apart in the air. A 65-foot reconstruction of a portion of the plane, revealed at the press conference, showed holes perforating the upper part of the cockpit, according to reporter Luke Harding.  We can't be 100% sure  that no one suffered,  but we've got to sort of think that was the case,  a relative says. The report mainly focuses on the cause of the crash and avoids  blame and culpability ; a separate criminal investigation will point fingers, reports AFP. The report at least rejects Moscow's claim that the Boeing 777 was downed by a missile fired by Ukrainian troops on July 17, 2014, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. But about 30 minutes before the report's release, Moscow had dismissed it.

Up to 25% of cardiac patients report having such experiences. The study, which followed only 52 patients, found an association between seeing light and higher levels of carbon dioxide, but that does not mean CO2 necessarily caused the effect, scientists pointed out.

"(Sep 9, 2018  1:10 PM CDT) The US Tennis Association fined Serena Williams $17,000 Sunday for her outburst in the US Open final as tennis legend Billie Jean King and the National Organization for Women rallied to her defense, the Washington Post reports. The tournament referee's office said the 23-time Grand Slam champion was being fined $10,000 for  verbal abuse,  $4,000 for the warning about coaching, and $3,000 for breaking her racket, per Fox News. The money will be taken from her $1.85 million runner-up prize money. The 6-2, 6-4 victory Saturday by Naomi Osaka, the first female Japanese player to win the US Open, was marred by controversy when Williams and chair umpire Carlos Ramos argued and he docked her a game.  Several things went very wrong during the U.S. Open women's finals today,  tweeted King on Saturday. In her view,  coaching on every point should be allowed in tennis  and Williams shouldn't have been penalized for arguing:  When a man does the same, he's 'outspoken' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out the double standard.  Williams, who was penalized after calling Ramos  a thief,  said after the match that  he's never taken a game from a man because they said 'thief.'  The National Organization for Women echoed the sentiment, saying Ramos should be fired:  ... In actuality men stretch the rules all the time and are lionized for being 'bad boys' while women are benched,  says NOW President Toni Van Pelt. (A Post column argues that Ramos also ruined the moment for Osaka.)",Serena Williams Fined $17K
"(Dec 3, 2012  2:52 AM) Neither concern for the planet nor a weak global economy have been able to keep carbon emissions down, researchers say. Emissions rose 3.6% to a new record last year and have risen another 2.6% so far this year, putting the planet on what now appears to be an inevitable path toward climate change and more extreme weather, reports the New York Times. China and India's rapidly expanding economies led the emissions growth, which was more than enough to cancel out falling emission levels from Europe and the US. Representatives from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Doha to discuss climate change, but few expect the conference to bring the world much closer to solving the problem. Researchers warn that the internationally agreed upon goal of limiting warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit is rapidly moving out of reach. The goal will become unachievable  unless large and concerted global mitigation efforts are initiated soon,  says the scientist who leads the carbon tracking project.",World Carbon Emissions Hit New Record in 2011

"(Jul 11, 2016  6:13 AM CDT) Beachgoers were treated to a jarring sight—and smell—on the western shore of Alabama's Mobile Bay Saturday when they discovered dozens of dead bull sharks.  We kept smelling this awful smell every time a gust of wind would come,  a beachgoer tells FOX6.  We [checked] the beach next door and we found it was just lined with sharks.  WKRG reports close to 100 sharks were found, though the Alabama Marine Resources Division puts the number at 57, per AL.com. One tourist says about 40 sharks were entangled in a single net.  It appears somebody put out a gill net and some of these sharks swam into the net and got tangled—and with sharks, if they are not moving in the water, they die,  AMRD rep Chris Blankenship tells WPMI. A man tells WKRG that he observed someone  put this big gill net out there  in the water. As of Saturday morning, there was  a lot of stuff flopping in it.  Officials suspect someone tried to free the sharks from the net before leaving them on the beach.  It is difficult since there are no markings on the net or since there [weren't] any people to know if the persons were licensed or using it illegally,  Blankenship says, adding the animals appear to be juvenile bull sharks, possibly born in March or April. Officials are investigating and tell the public to report unattended gill nets to the Marine Resources Division.

"(May 23, 2015  2:45 PM CDT) Workers constructing a sewer line in East Jerusalem last month discovered a 2,000-year-old water-supply system that—think about this—worked fairly well until the last century, LiveScience reports. The 13-mile long Lower Aqueduct, which was fed by a spring south of Bethlehem and runs through four modern-day Jerusalem neighborhoods, was built by kings governing Judea and environs from roughly 140 BC to 37 BC. City rulers kept it up over the years, covering the open channel with terra cotta pipe about 500 years ago. It remained a major water-supply source until an electrical water distribution system replaced it roughly 100 years ago, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority. The IAA says it will cover part of the aqueduct  for the sake of future generations  and expose parts for access by the general public, Discovery reports. Meanwhile, archaeologists are marveling:  The aqueduct begins at the ‘En ‘Eitam spring, near Solomon’s Pools south of Bethlehem,  says IAA Director Ya'akov Billig.  Despite its length, it flows along a very gentle downward slope whereby the water level falls just one meter per kilometer of distance.  The original designers look pretty smart, too, having built the aqueduct in uninhabited areas where Jerusalem neighborhoods now exist, the Times of Israel notes. Other parts of the aqueduct system have been found before, including tunnels in the City of David and ones near the Sultan's Pool beside Mount Zion in Jerusalem.",Workers Stumble on 2K-Year-Old Marvel in Jerusalem

The son of the woman from Winter Haven, Fla., died in October, this time resulting in a felony aggravated manslaughter charge against her. Per the Orlando Sentinel, the story begins Dec. 4, 2009, not even two weeks after baby Angelina was born. Piche-Pitts brought the infant into bed to breastfeed and dozed off, waking to find the baby  cold and stiff to the touch,  per an affidavit; Angelina's death was ruled accidental. On Oct. 6 of this year, her 18-day-old son, Javier, became unresponsive after she fell asleep in bed with him during a bottle feeding, the affidavit notes. His death was also ruled accidental, though his autopsy hasn't been finalized. What leads these two incidents into negligence territory is that Piche-Pitts had been warned both during her pregnancies and after the births about co-sleeping dangers—via training and counseling, and from hospital staff and family—and especially so after Angelina died, per the Polk County Sheriff's Office (which also gave WTSP a rap sheet on Piche-Pitts that includes burglary, domestic violence, and possession of meth). The Times notes the case highlights the ongoing controversy on co-sleeping, with some (especially in non-Western parts of the world) insisting it can be a safe way to get infants back to sleep if practiced correctly, while others continue to note its dangers.  These are very, very difficult cases,  a Polk County prosecutor says.  We are not charging parents with crimes because accidents happen. There has got to be something more to it.

He also thinks his father killed his fourth wife, and said so on a Lifetime show in January and again to the Chicago Tribune this month.  I don't want to come out and say he did it ... but, I'm sure he did it,  Stephen now says. Since his father's conviction in 2012 for the 2004 killing of Kathleen Savio, his third wife, Stephen has lived in his father's home and raised his dad's kids. He has his suspicions about the 2007 disappearance of Stacy Peterson, in which his father remains a suspect. Stephen says that at first he believed his dad's stories that Savio drowned accidentally and that Stacy left him for another man—even though, Stephen says, the day after Stacy went missing his father brought over his guns and more than $200,000 in checks for safekeeping. Stephen lost his job as an Oak Brook, Ill., police officer for failing to disclose details of interactions he had with his dad after the disappearance. And he's run through his pension raising his father's children. So when Lifetime called with a $10,000 offer to be on the show Monster in My Family, Stephen took the deal. He says he told his father about the show, which details the life Stephen, now 37, has had with Drew and Stacy's two children, who are in middle school; Stephen also looked after Drew's sons with Savio, who are now young adults. Stephen says there was no  a-ha moment,  when he changed his mind about his father's role in Stacy's disappearance, but he does recall her fear after Savio's death.  You kind of look back and think, maybe she did know something, or maybe something did happen,  Stephen says.

A spoon found in his classroom matched those in the pictures and had traces of semen on it. The alleged victims were boys and girls aged 7 to 10. Police say more charges are likely, and they are trying to determine how long Berndt, who had taught at the school since 1979, has been abusing children for.  This occurred in his regular classroom with his students,  a police sergeant says.  It wasn't done in secrecy.

"(Jun 23, 2016  11:40 AM CDT) When police received a report Monday that a man was slumped over next to a white van and tractor-trailer in Norcross, Ga., they were likely more focused on the man than on the van. And it turned out the man, 31-year-old Johnny Taylor of Bridgeport, Conn., was dead, apparently of natural causes, the AP reports. But as they were waiting for medical examiners to show up, deputies say they caught a whiff of something coming from the van, per WRDW—the pungent smell of pot. When the officers checked out the van, they found a box with sealed bags of marijuana inside. They spotted similar boxes in the back of the truck and obtained a warrant, after which they found several hundred pounds of marijuana, with an estimated street value of $12 million. Security surveillance shows a man dropping off the tractor-trailer the night before, then leaving in a car; the white van pulled up alongside it shortly after. Cops have been able to interview the man who dropped off the tractor-trailer, per WXIA: He showed back up on Monday to the parking lot while cops were still there and told them the deceased had asked him for lessons on driving the truck. He hasn't been arrested and may have been in the dark about what Taylor planned to put into the truck.

"(Jun 26, 2014  9:20 AM CDT) It was, as the Washington Post puts it,  the bite felt round the world.  Now, Luis Suarez's World Cup is over as a result. FIFA officials have handed the Uruguayan soccer star a four-month ban from all soccer activity, including nine national team games, after he chomped down on Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder in a match earlier this week. He must also pay a fine of more than $110,000, the Bleacher Report notes. Uruguayan soccer officials argued the incident was all played up by the media, however.  Everybody knows the British media have an issue with Suarez  and the pictures  don't show anything,  Uruguay's captain told the Guardian. Others argued the images of bite marks on Chiellini were Photoshopped to appear worse. Uruguay's soccer federation president even told the AP that Italy may have to answer to FIFA officials as members of Italy's staff tried to hit Suarez afterward, he said. The FIFA disciplinary committee could have suspended Suarez for anywhere from two games to two years, but how they landed on four months isn't clear. Meanwhile, the whole debacle has paid off for a lucky few: The AP notes more than 150 people across Europe bet that Suarez would again sink his teeth into someone on the pitch, raking in winnings at odds of about 175:1.",FIFA Bans Soccer Star 4 Months for Bite
"(Nov 24, 2017  8:03 AM) Her collection of ancient artifacts, worth more than $750,000, includes a Roman dagger, Neolithic ax heads, a mummy mask, and a crucifix from the era of Jesus Christ—treasures unearthed in Egypt, Syria, Israel, and beyond. But her boasts about them have some red with anger rather than green with envy. After the West Australian explored Joan Howard's collection, which she has stored in Perth, Egypt's Heritage Taskforce demanded the Australian government investigate the 95-year-old—dubbed  Indiana Joan —whom it accuses of looting ancient artifacts while her husband, Keith Howard, worked in senior roles with the UN in the Middle East in the 1960s and '70s. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says an investigation is now underway and any illegal items found will be returned to their country of origin, reports the Australian AP. The West Australian stressed Howard took the artifacts—including some she found while volunteering on digs— before laws changed and it became legally difficult to do so.  The UNESCO convention preventing illicit transport of such items, for instance, was passed in 1970. But the BBC reports individual countries Howard visited have had similar laws on the books since the 1950s; Egypt has had laws protecting its artifacts since the 1880s. Archaeologist Monica Hanna of Egypt's Heritage Taskforce argues in an open letter that Howard  behaved as a pirate. ... These activities decontextualize the cultural heritage,  leaving it  with holes that cannot be filled.  If the collection remains with Howard, it will go  where it should go  upon her death, Howard has said, without elaborating.

"(Mar 30, 2015  7:26 AM CDT) A German foreign minister today cited  some progress and some setbacks  in an 11th-hour attempt to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran in Swiss talks—and those  setbacks  include a seemingly sudden decision by Iran not to ship the bulk of its uranium to Russia as it had tentatively agreed to do, NBC News reports.  The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program and we do not intend sending them abroad,  Abbas Araqchi, Tehran's main negotiator, told reporters yesterday, per AFP. Araqchi maintained, however, that reaching a basic agreement by tomorrow's midnight deadline was still  doable,  and a senior State Department official tried to squash rumors that this would effectively end prospects for an interim agreement, per NBC. The uranium was to have been sent to Russia, which would have converted it into fuel rods for Iran's commercial nuclear reactor, rendering it difficult for Iran to extract weapons-grade fuel, the New York Times notes. Critics already hesitant about striking a deal with Iran likely won't view the country's latest announcement as a good one.  We've got a regime that's never quite kept their word about anything,  John Boehner told CNN yesterday.  I just don't understand why we would sign an agreement with a group of people who, in my opinion, have no intention of keeping their word.

"(Jul 12, 2017  10:01 AM CDT) Scientists are  very excited  to learn more about a baby tooth that only the most sophisticated DNA dating tech can analyze. Some 150,000 years ago, a young girl lost her baby tooth, and it fell into the sediment of a cave in Siberia from which the first three (and thus far only) other fossils identified in 2010 as being Denisovan were found, reports Live Science. Before then, the hominin group that's as genetically distinct from modern humans as Neanderthals was completely unknown. This fourth fossil is the oldest, per the paper in the Science Advances journal, suggesting that the mysterious group lived in Central Asia so long ago that there was likely greater interaction with, and thus more potential to interbreed with, Neanderthals—something we humans appear to have done, too. Five years ago, scientists would have probably had to destroy the tooth to study its genetic fingerprints, but recently Viviane Slon at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany was able to scrape the tooth's surface and drill into its root to collect 10 milligrams of material that contained the DNA her team ultimately studied.  We only have relatively little data from this archaic group, so having any additional individuals is something we're very excited about,  she tells the New York Times. The other three fossils, a finger bone and two molars, were also unearthed in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. The baby tooth, found in deep sediment as much as 227,000 years old, is one of the oldest human specimens ever found in Central Asia.

"(Oct 15, 2015  10:20 AM CDT) Dietary supplements promise to help you lose weight, build muscle, and boost energy, but they could also send you to the emergency room. Some 23,000 ER visits each year are attributed to everything from herbal pills to vitamins that cause cardiovascular problems, severe allergic reactions, and vomiting, particularly in young adults, according to a new study from the FDA and CDC. They tracked ER visits from 63 hospitals over 10 years, per the New York Times and Time, and found about 10% of patients needed to be hospitalized; the study didn't review whether any deaths occurred. Though prescription drugs send 30 times as many people to the ER annually, most are older adults; 28% of people who visited the ER because of supplements were 20 to 34, and half of those visits involved weight-loss or energy aids, per NBC News. Dietary supplements aren't required to carry warning labels about side effects, don't require FDA approval, and are generally  considered safe until proved otherwise,  notes the Times.  The system has failed,  says a Harvard professor who calls the findings  disheartening.   It's failing to protect consumers from very serious harms.  Industry officials claim half of all Americans use dietary supplements, meaning 23,000 ER visits represents a sliver of users.

"(Nov 9, 2014  6:11 AM) A charter school in Manhattan has been conducting an experiment of sorts: How do students perform if teachers are paid $125,000 a year? The results so far at the Equity Project Charter School look promising, the Atlantic reports. The fifth- through eighth-graders slowly saw test scores rise over the period studied. Four years of math at the school showed results comparable to 5.6 years at another school with demographically similar students, Vox reports. In science and English, they gained an approximately an additional half-year's worth of learning over other kids, the Wall Street Journal reports. What's more, the score gap between white and Hispanic eighth-graders shrank by 78%, Vox notes. It isn't just the high pay that sets the school apart, however. The 480-student school, called TEP, hired highly experienced teachers who underwent a day of teaching  auditions.  They have extensive administrative duties in a school that cut some standard administrative positions, and they must hold up to tough scrutiny to get rehired. Turnover ended up being high across a four-year period, the Atlantic notes, with 20 out of 43 teachers working for only one year. (At city middle schools, about 27% of teachers don't do a second year.)

But it looks like that's exactly what's about to happen: Thanks to work done by Claire, now 14 and a high school freshman, and Wiener, who died in December at age 92, the state House and Senate have both passed a bill requiring public schools to teach students about the Holocaust and other genocides, the Washington Post reports. The state's Democratic governor, Kate Brown, must still sign it into law. As Claire explained to Oregon Public Broadcasting after Wiener's death, it had been his lifelong dream to get such mandatory statewide curriculum standards implemented, and she decided to help him achieve it.

The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, approved by voice vote, had triggered a threat from Riyadh to pull billions of dollars from the US economy if the bill is enacted. The legislation, sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chuck Schumer, D-NY, gives victims' families the right to sue in US court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks that killed thousands in New York, the Washington, DC, area, and Pennsylvania.

Relatives of Sept. 11 victims have urged the Obama administration to declassify and release 28 pages of US intelligence that allegedly discusses possible Saudi involvement in the attacks. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir denied earlier this month that the kingdom made any threats over the bill.

"(Oct 22, 2017  10:10 AM CDT) The Los Angeles Times is out with a potentially damning story about film director James Toback. The paper spoke with 38 women, 31 on the record, who say the longtime writer/director sexually harassed them on movie sets, during interviews, and even on the street, using his Hollywood credentials as a way to get them into abusive situations. Several of the women say Toback, who directed indie movies like Black & White and Two Girls and a Guy, would approach them on the street, brag about his friendship with Robert Downey Jr. or his Oscar nomination for writing the 1991 Warren Beatty film Bugsy, and then invite them somewhere under the auspices of interviewing them or having them read for a part in an upcoming film. Once they were alone, the women say Toback would quickly become inappropriate. One woman recounts walking down the street with Toback in Manhattan as he questioned her about masturbation and pubic hair. Many of the women describe experiences of Toback demanding they get naked and of him rubbing up against them to the point of ejaculation. These incidents stretch back decades, and other publications had previously published victims' accounts of Toback's behavior, including Gawker. But several of the women interviewed by the Times say they were inspired to come forward after news broke of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Louise Post, who says she was abused by Toback in 1987, told the paper,  Today, I cried for the first time since then about it. I was crying for the 20-year-old woman who lost something vital that day—her innocence.",38 Women Detail Sexual Abuse by Director James Toback

In some places, people have had to dig tunnels through up to 15 feet of snow in order the leave their homes, the AP reports. A dozen major roads have been closed, 300 trains canceled, and 1,000 schools closed. Thousands of soldiers have also been deployed to clear roads and help people trapped in the snow. At least 74 have died so far. The predicament isn't unique to Romania; all of Eastern Europe has been buffeted by a cold snap all month.

"(Mar 29, 2012  10:16 AM CDT) With Circuit City now long gone, everything should be coming up roses for Best Buy, right? No such luck. America's biggest electronics retailer today announced that it will be shuttering 50 of its big-box stores after posting a fiscal fourth quarter loss that was due partly to restructuring charges. It has other big changes planned: a new compensation model for employees tied in part to customer service; 100 new Best Buy Mobile stores; $800 million in cost cuts in three years; and a goal to increase online revenue 15%. Writing for CNET, Larry Dignan sums up Best Buy's problem thusly:  It can't be the showroom for electronic sales online.  Best Buy's biggest foe is, of course, Amazon, and Dignan believes the only way to keep up in an e-commerce world is to improve customer service. Best Buy appears to have gotten the memo: It plans to bulk up its loyalty programs (sample perk: free Geek Squad house call for Reward Zone Silver members), switch to free shipping, and make returns easier. But Dignan still sees two issues: The company is selling more Apple products, which return less of a profit for Best Buy, and, well, there's still Amazon.","With Eye on Amazon, Best Buy to Close 50 Stores"

Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, 45, is in jail and faces a murder charge for the shooting death of 31-year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot seemingly at random on a pedestrian pier Wednesday. Turns out US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was about to deport Lopez-Sanchez again in March, but gave him to the San Francisco County Sheriff over a drug-related warrant, says a source in federal law enforcement. That's when the story took an unexpected turn. The sheriff let Lopez-Sanchez go, saying he had already served his time for felony re-entry after deportation and had no outstanding warrants, KTVU reports. The sheriff also ignored ICE's request to detain him and send a notice before freeing Lopez-Sanchez—because city officials see  immigration detainers  as violations of the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, according to the sheriff's legal counsel. Lopez-Sanchez already has seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses, and was on probation in Texas. The sheriff  didn't even need to hold him,  the law enforcement source says.

The venture capitalist and Facebook investor, 47, says he  certainly hopes to  live to 120 and is already taking steps to help him get there. Thiel tells Bloomberg TV he follows a paleo-like diet and limits his sugar—not eating sugar is, in his view,  the one nutritional rule.  But he doesn't think paleo  gets you to 120,  he says. He also takes human growth hormone daily, which  helps maintain muscle mass, so you're much less likely to get bone injuries, arthritis.

The BBC speaks with the inspiring man, whose mother died just two days after he was born and who went on to suffer infantile paralysis as the result of polio. Machado was housed in a  polio ward  with other kids who, like him, weren't expected to live more than a decade. He recalls  Eliana, Pedrinho, Anderson, Claudia, Luciana, and Tania ... Each loss was like a dismembering.  Only Machado and Eliana Zagui (he describes her as  his strength  and like a sister) are, somewhat inexplicably, still alive. The BBC explains that he's restricted to the hospital, where he permanently relies on an artificial respirator, due to fear of infection. He's been beyond its walls about 50 times, a feat that has become easier as medical advances shrink the bulk of the equipment needed to allow him to do so. At 32, he saw the sea for the first time, with Zagui by his side—as she is in the room they share, which is decorated with dolls (Zagui's) and film memorabilia (Machado's). The latter items speak to Machado's passion: computer animation. He's working on a 3D animated film series based on a book Zagui wrote. Closer to home, the El Paso Times looks at the struggle some American polio survivors—who contracted the disease in the '40s and '50s but emerged without such debilitating health problems—now face due to post-polio syndrome, which unleashes symptoms ranging from muscle weakness to swallowing problems.

"(May 26, 2014  11:18 AM CDT) Most people today probably associate Memorial Day with barbeques and sales, but EJ Dionne Jr. takes a look at its history in the Washington Post and concludes that it's  a peculiarly appropriate holiday for our times.  Memorial Day began as Decoration Day, honoring those who died in the Civil War. There were bitter debates about whether it started in the North or South, which persisted until 1966, when President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, NY, the holiday's official birthplace. Only after World War I did the day come to honor all American war dead.  Seen one way, the Memorial Day story traces a heartening journey  of a divided nation coming back together, Dionne writes. But let's not forget its Civil War roots. The political conflicts of that era  bear eerie similarities to our own.  No, we're not dealing with anything as important as slavery, but there are stark regional differences over federal and judicial power, the constitution, and patriotism. Memorial Day should remind us to conduct these debates responsibly, and  that politics can have dire consequences.  Click for his full column.",What Memorial Day Means in 2014
"(Nov 8, 2012  7:06 PM) It's not so much a surprising conclusion as a reminder of what's at stake: The Congressional Budget Office warned today that a failure to head off the fiscal cliff at year's end will probably lead to a new recession next year along with a jump in the unemployment rate to 9.1%, reports Politico. The nonpartisan panel said the abrupt combination of tax hikes and spending cuts also would slow economic growth by .5% over the year, reports the Wall Street Journal. The report comes as House Republicans and the White House were suggesting they were ready to talk about a deal. And now comes the tricky part, as the Christian Science Monitor explains: While the CBO warned that doing nothing and plunging over the cliff is bad in the short term, it said those tax increases and spending cuts would help in the long run by reducing the deficit and the national debt.  The ideal way forward, suggested in the CBO report and in other independent reviews, would be to change the cliff into a gradual slope,  writes the Monitor's Mark Trumbull,  one that avoids recession in the near-term but still leads down a path of deficit reduction.",CBO: Fiscal Cliff Will Bring 9.1% Unemployment

I just wish my husband had been alive to see this.  Suspect Timothy Williams, 56, was arrested Wednesday at his residence in Melbourne, Florida, and charged with second-degree murder, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. Officials relied on DNA taken from semen during an autopsy, but a 1999 search on the FBI's DNA database came up cold. Then came a  familial DNA  test. Approved by New York law in 2017, familial DNA searches can identify the suspect's family members and generate new leads.

Now the site has named a new potential Obama relative: the first documented African-American slave. CNN reports on the result of some 500 hours of work by four genealogists, who were able to link Obama, via, perhaps surprisingly, his mother's family, with John Punch. Ancestry.com explains that Punch was an indentured servant in Virginia whose foiled escape in 1640 earned him a lifetime of slavery (this was years before Virginia slavery laws came into effect). The team apparently decided to begin digging after learning Stanley Ann Dunham had African ancestors—white Virginians who descended from an African man. The genealogists then traced Obama to a Virginia family named Bunch, and  all of the surviving evidence we studied very strongly points to conclusion John Bunch is the son of John Punch.

Ayling, then 20, said she was attacked by two men after flying to Milan and going to an apartment for a photo shoot. The BBC reports she was reportedly injected with the tranquilizer ketamine.  When I woke up I was wearing a pink bodysuit and the socks I'm in now,  she said in a statement to police published in Italian media.  I realized I was in the [trunk] of a car, with my wrists and ankles tied and my mouth taped. I was inside a bag, with only a small hole that allowed me to breathe.  She was held in an Italian farmhouse for six days and was ultimately released by her kidnappers at the British Consulate; they had allegedly variously told her they wanted ransom money and planned to sell her on the dark web. Herba, 30, argued that he was in love with Ayling, whom he had met on Facebook, and wanted to boost her career by getting her publicity via the kidnapping—an idea inspired by the film By Any Means. Prosecutors called him a  narcissist and a fantasist who was obsessed with Miss Ayling,  and the court determined Ayling wasn't involved in the plot.

Police in Snohomish County, Washington, say the 78-year-old killed himself Monday morning, around three hours before a jury that started its deliberations Friday found him guilty of first-degree murder, the Everett Herald reports. The verdict was delivered despite a defense motion to dismiss the case following Miller's death.  I'm glad that we got to hear the verdict,  said Jim Scharf, the lead sheriff's detective in the case. Loomis, who had been riding her bike to visit her horse in a stable near Bethell, was found dying on a remote dirt road on Aug. 23, 1972, the Washington Post reports. She had been raped and shot in the head. The case was cold for decades until 2008, when a crime lab technician discovered a semen stain on a boot Loomis had been wearing. Searches of genetic information on genealogy websites—the same method that caught the Golden State Killer—identified Miller as a suspect in 2018 and he was arrested in 2019 after DNA recovered from a coffee cup he had discarded was found to be an exact match for the DNA on the boot. He was freed on $1 million bond after the arrest. The Herald notes that this appears to be the oldest case in the world in which forensic genealogy has led to a conviction.

And the lawmakers aren't blind to potential conflicts of interest: They check in with ethics committee lawyers thousands of times per year. From 2007 to 2011, those lawyers offered some 2,800 opinions on such matters, making 40,000 phone calls in the process. But these communications rarely seek to dissuade legislators from their goals; in fact, they typically help justify the efforts. Lawmakers argue that they're fighting for the greater good, which in some cases matches their own interests. And indeed, ethics rules seem to support that argument, offering exemptions to a financial conflict-of-interest rule. For instance,  if a dairy farmer represented a dairy farming state in the Senate... he would not fall under the strictures of this rule,  says the Senate ethics manual. But it's time to tighten such rules, experts tell the Post.

Among the mementoes in the house: a photo of them as young girls posing with Bing Crosby. It's not clear whether any other relatives exist, which is part of the reason police have gone public.

"(Nov 1, 2008  11:27 PM CDT) Graham Harrell fired a 28-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree with one second left as No. 6 Texas Tech stunned No. 1 Texas 39-33 tonight in a wild shootout. Texas had stormed back from a 19-0 deficit to take a 33-32 lead when Vondrell McGee scored on a 4-yard run with 1:29 left in the fourth. Harrell drove the Red Raiders to the touchdown in six plays, slinging the long pass to Crabtree, who broke the tackle of Curtis Brown near the sideline, kept his balance, and scooted the last five yards for a score. If he had been tackled inbounds, the clock likely would have run out. Thousands of Texas Tech fans poured onto the field and had to be sent off while the play was under review. Once the fans were chased off the field and Tech kicked the extra point, the Red Raiders were penalized and forced to kick off from their own 7. When Texas couldn't pull of a miracle kickoff return, the fans ran back on the field to celebrate the biggest win in Texas Tech history.",Texas Tech Upsets No. 1 Texas
"(Feb 2, 2015  12:08 PM) China has executed a father and daughter after they were convicted of murdering a woman at a McDonald's, the BBC reports. Three others received jail time in the 2014 incident. The attackers were members of a banned cult known as Church of the Almighty God, and they were apparently trying to recruit the woman they killed, one Wu Shuoyan, reportedly in her 30s. The daughter, Zhang Fan, twice asked for Wu's contact information. The victim's refusal to provide it prompted Zhang to throw a chair at her; the group thought Wu was  possessed by an evil spirit  and began attacking her.  We had to destroy her,  said father Zhang Lidong. The cult, also known as Quannengshen, has been banned since 1995, CNN reports, amid word of kidnappings and extortion as well as other violence. The group's website says some 400,000 members were arrested between 2011 and last year; hundreds of members have been held by Chinese officials since the killing, the BBC notes. The cult, which believes that God, in the form of a Chinese woman, will cause the apocalypse, says it has millions of believers.",China Executes 2 in Illegal Cult Over McDonald's Murder

America's top infectious disease expert says seven states with rising COVID-19 rates should take extra care this Labor Day weekend to avoid trouble in the fall, the New York Post reports.  There are several states that are at risk for surging, namely North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois,  Fauci told Bloomberg this week.  Those states are starting to see an increase in the percent positive of their testing; that is generally predictive that there's going to be a problem.  Among the seven states, Illinois has the highest official coronavirus tally with at least 241,704 cases, Newsweek reported Friday. The other states in descending order are Indiana (96,854), Missouri (89,639), Iowa (67,692), Arkansas (63,081), South Dakota (14,337), and North Dakota (12,977). In a call to Mike Pence and several governors this week, Fauci advised them to follow mask-wearing and social-distancing guidelines.  If we're careless about it, then we could wind up with a surge following Labor Day,  Fauci said.  It really depends on how we behave as a country.

Police say the men in Connecticut, Florida, and Ohio were arrested thanks to tips from the public, CNN reports. In the Ohio case, police say 20-year-old white nationalist James Reardon was arrested Saturday over an Instagram post that suggested he wanted to attack a Jewish community center. In Connecticut, 22-year-old Norwalk resident Brandon Wagshol was arrested after authorities received a tip that he was trying to buy large capacity rifle magazines from out of state, CBS New York reports. The Norwalk Police Department and the FBI say they discovered that Wagshol had posted on Facebook expressing interest in carrying out a mass shooting. Authorities say a raid on Wagshol's home uncovered numerous weapons, along with items like a titanium body armor and a combat helmet. TPM reports that Wagshol, who is charged with four counts of illegal possession of high-capacity firearm magazines, appears to have made numerous racist posts online using multiple Twitter accounts.

"(Oct 17, 2019  7:50 AM CDT) What is likely to be one of the last trials of a former Nazi guard kicks off Thursday in juvenile court in Germany. Bruno Dey is 93 and in poor health, per Deutsche Welle, but prosecutors say that in the height of World War II, he was a 17-year-old SS sharpshooter capable of climbing up and down the watch towers at the Stutthof death camp in what is now Poland. Some 120,000 prisoners were held there, and more than half would die. Dey, whose name was found on SS clothing in Stutthof’s archives in 2016, is charged as an accessory to murder in 5,230 deaths—5,000 attributed to hostile conditions, 200 to gassing, and 30 to a fatal shot—between 1944 and 1945, reports the BBC. His case is being heard in juvenile court due to his age at the time. Though he's admitted to seeing  emaciated figures  and  people who had suffered,  Dey denies that he  knowingly supported  the murders of Jewish prisoners or  carried out execution orders,  as prosecutors allege, per Deutsche Welle and the Local. As Dey sees it, there was little the teen could do to stand up to Adolf Hitler's regime when he was sent to the camp rather than the war front, owing to a heart disease. As Dey's health is poor, there's a risk his trial will be halted. Per the BBC, a 95-year-old former Stuffhof guard was charged with accessory to murder in 2018 but then hospitalized and deemed permanently unfit to stand trial. For now, twice-a-week hearings are limited to no more than two hours each. (Cousins separated during the Holocaust only just reunited.)","Former Nazi Guard, 93, Headed to Juvenile Court"

Some 500,000 new users signed up to Parler in the space of three days, boosting its total to 1.5 million, compared to 330 million on Twitter, Mediaite reports. Conservative meme creator  Carpe Donktum  was permanently banned from Twitter this week for repeated copyright violation and the account of National Pulse editor Raheem Kassam was locked after he shared graphic video of a stabbing attack in England.

The baby boy weighed 9.45 ounces at his August birth—and has survived, making him the smallest baby boy ever to do so. The BBC reports the baby was discharged from Tokyo's Keio University Hospital Feb. 20, two months after his due date, after reaching 7 pounds.

The tiniest child to survive remains a German girl born in 2015 who weighed 8.89 ounces. Girls born extremely small have a higher survival rate than boys, possibly because their lungs develop faster: Indeed, the Japan Times notes the registry lists just 23 babies who weighed less than 10.58 ounces at birth and survived; 19 of them were girls.

"(Nov 4, 2018  6:31 AM) Washington, DC, appears poised to become the first municipality in the nation to let 16-year-olds vote in national elections, including presidential races. A measure to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 cleared a committee last week and now heads to the full council, reports WTOP. To pass, it needs the support of a majority of the 13-member city council, and WJLA reports that eight members already have voiced their approval. While a handful of US cities allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections, none grants the right in national elections. DC has an estimated 10,000 teens of that age, most of them minorities, per WJLA.  At the age of 16, your legal relationship with the government changes,  says council member Charles Allen, who introduced the measure. He points out that many 16-year-olds get jobs and begin paying taxes, and they also start driving.  Ironically, they pay fees to get a license plate that reads ‘End Taxation Without Representation.’ I think it’s time to change that.  Allen says he was inspired in part by the youth political movement that surfaced after school shootings. If passed by the council and signed by the mayor, the measure must undergo a 30-day congressional review period.

We want to reassure tourists they can come to Uzbekistan,  adds Sophie Ibbotson in the statement.

"(Jan 4, 2015  5:51 AM) Pope Francis named 15 new cardinals today, selecting them from 14 nations, including far-flung corners of the world such as Tonga, New Zealand, Cape Verde, and Myanmar, to reflect the diversity of the church and its growth in places like Asia and Africa. Other cardinals hail from Ethiopia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Another is from Sicily, where the Church in recent decades has been galvanizing public rejection of the Mafia. Referring to the Vatican, Francis told faithful in St. Peter's Square that the churchmen come  from every continent  and  show the indelible tie with the church of Rome to churches in the world.  In addition to the 15 new cardinals who are under 80 and thus eligible to vote for the next pope, Francis bestowed the honor on five churchmen older than that. He said they distinguished themselves for their work in the Vatican bureaucracy, in diplomatic service in giving witness to their love of Christ and God's people. Those included men from Peru and Mozambique. Speaking from a Vatican window to a crowd in St. Peter's Square, Francis made another surprise announcement. He said that on Feb. 12-13, he will lead of meeting of all cardinals to  reflect on the orientations and proposals for the reform of the Roman Curia,  the Vatican's administrative bureaucracy.

Based on lost productivity and uncollected taxes, Young pegs the hit at  around $3.5 billion … it's still a little too early to assess what the actual damage is going to be.  Within the industry, Young thinks the strike could shake up the series pilot process and business model for advertising sales. And when will things get back to normal?

We don't know what happened,  a Berkeley police rep tells the AP, which describes the balcony as having  disintegrated  just before 1am local time.  I just heard a bang and a lot of shouting,  said a 21-year-old student from Ireland who was asleep in the five-story building. Said another:  I walked out and I saw rubble on the street and a bunch of Irish students crying.  The AP notes that Berkeley is home to hundreds of Irish students in the country for the summer on J-1 visas, with one such student calling it  the Irish hub.  Ireland's foreign affairs minister confirmed that  a number of young Irish citizens have died  in the collapse, notes RTE.

"(Aug 31, 2015  8:00 PM CDT) The State Department released roughly 7,000 pages of Hillary Rodham Clinton's emails today, including about 150 emails that have been censored because they contain information that is now deemed classified. Department officials say the redacted information was classified in preparation for the public release of the emails and not identified as classified at the time Clinton sent or received the messages. All the censored material in the latest group of emails is classified at the  confidential  level, not at higher  top secret  or compartmentalized levels, they say.  It's somewhere around 150 that have been subsequently upgraded  in classification, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters. Still, the increasing amounts of blacked-out information from Clinton's email history as secretary of state will surely prompt additional questions about her handling of government secrets while in office and that of her most trusted advisers. The Democratic presidential front-runner now says her use of a home email server for government business was a mistake, and government inspectors have pointed to exchanges that never should have been sent via unsecured channels. Toner insisted that nothing encountered in the agency's review of Clinton's documents was marked as classified.  Classification—we’ve said this many times—is not an exact science,  he says, per Politico.  There’s many strong opinions. … It's not up to me to litigate these kinds of questions from the State Department podium.","State Dept. Censors 150 Hillary Emails, With a Catch"

The facilities in many cities serve as neighborhood post offices. The Postal Service announced last year that it was looking at closing up to 252 mail-processing centers and 3,700 post offices, as part of a plan to save some $6.5 billion a year. It began backing off the plan last week, saying it no longer planned to close thousands of rural post offices but would keep them open with shorter hours. Today's announcement addressed 600 branches and satellite stations that had been included in the original study for closure and were expected to shut down sometime after tomorrow.  Any proposals to close these facilities have been placed on hold and will not close at this time,  says a spokesman.

"(Jun 7, 2016  1:41 AM CDT) Kimbo Slice, the bearded street fighter who parlayed his Internet popularity into a mixed-martial-arts career and worldwide fame, has died. He was 42. Slice, whose real name was Kevin Ferguson, was taken to a hospital in Margate, Fla., near his home Monday, Coral Springs Police Sgt. Carla Kmiotek says. Slice's death was confirmed by Mike Imber, his longtime manager.  We lost our brother today,  Imber tells the AP. The cause of death is still unclear. Kmiotek says there is no active police investigation, and no foul play is suspected. Slice was a Bahamian-born ex-football player and strip club bouncer who began competing in unsanctioned street fights in 2003. Videos of his violent knockout victories in those bouts became wildly popular online, both for his punching power and his distinctive, intimidating appearance. He studied MMA and eventually competed in several promotions, including with the UFC and Bellator, which staged his two most recent fights. While he went 5-2 and never won a championship belt, Slice became one of MMA's best-known figures, attracting large television audiences and crowds to his growing sport. He also had a pro boxing career between stints in the cage, going 7-0 with six knockouts from 2011 to 2013. Slice's death also was confirmed by Scott Coker, the CEO of Bellator, which promoted his return to MMA last year after a five-year absence.  One of the most popular MMA fighters ever, Kimbo was a charismatic, larger-than-life personality that transcended the sport,  Coker said.

"(Aug 28, 2016  7:34 AM CDT) Mylan CEO Heather Bresch has taken her fair share of scrutiny lately over EpiPen's soaring price, her own soaring salary, her dad, and even a since-rescinded MBA from West Virginia University. But even as her company's controversy grew, Bresch did something else that's getting scrutinized: She unloaded about 100,000 shares of stock on August 9, to the tune of a $5 million profit. Bresch did so under a 10b5 plan, which spans a certain waiting period and are set up to avoid the appearance of insider trading, reports the Guardian.  Yet,  as the Guardian writes,  Bresch did not need insider information to know that trouble lay ahead.  The grumbling about the price of EpiPen goes back to at least last September, when Bloomberg reported on EpiPen's marketing success story while noting the price had gone up 400%. Mylan subsequently hiked EpiPen's price again. In June, Wells Fargo noted in a report that Mylan had jacked prices on seven products by at least 100%, and on 24 products by at least 20%, hikes it said  could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk.  Mylan shares went from $49.20 per share on August 19, 10 days after Bresch's sale, to $43.11 on August 24—a $3 billion loss in value, notes Raw Story. Bresch, however, didn't completely dodge that hit: She still holds about 925,000 shares, adds the Guardian.

That's possibly the biggest running deficit a national committee has had going into a major election, says one operative. And while Republican fundraising may be somewhat limp—about 25% off its targets for the year—financial documents reveal mismanagement to be at the heart of the RNC's woes. Between January and September, the RNC received $82 million in donations, but spent $51 million raising that money.  Through September of this year, the RNC spent only $12.1 million on political operations,  the RNC treasurer said.  An additional $20 million would have gone a long ways in winning more races in 2010.

About $2 million in gold and $1.8 million in silver ends up in Switzerland's sewers each year, according to an environmental study commissioned by the Swiss government. Strange as it sounds, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology say it's not much of a surprise that 95 pounds of gold and 6,600 pounds of silver from Switzerland's gold refineries and watchmaking industry find a way into wastewater systems, along with trace amounts of rare earth minerals used in electronic components and even some paints, per CNN Money.

It took so long that Wood's lawyers filed an emergency appeal to stop the procedure after an hour because they say their 55-year-old client was still gasping for air at that point, reports the Guardian. According to the court filing cited by the LA Times, the lethal injection began at 1:52pm local time.

Sodexo, which receives more than $84,000 per year per inmate to run the prison, confirmed that the death occurred and called it a  tragedy . But it would not say if Chin had been designated an  at risk  inmate. For observers in England, Chin's death serves to highlight mounting problems within the country's prison system.  Too many prisoners are dying in custody,  academic and former inmate Alex Cavendish tells the Guardian.  A significant proportion of these deaths might have been avoided if appropriate care, including mental health support, had been in place and proper assessment procedures followed.  According to a report released this year, prison assaults in 2015 were up 27% over the year before; incidents of self-harm were up 24%. There's  a simple and unpalatable truth about far too many of our prisons,  the country's chief prison inspector tells the BBC.  They have become unacceptably violent and dangerous places.  Earlier this year, per the Independent, Bronzefield prison came under fire for distributing tents and sleeping bags to inmates being released, rather than arranging for housing.

"(Jun 20, 2010  4:07 PM CDT) BP's doomsday scenario was that a ruptured well could gush up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day, according to internal documents released today by Rep. Ed Markey—a far cry from the 5,000 barrels at which it pegged the leak at the time it submitted the documents to Congress, notes Politico. The scenario is based on the blowout preventer and other equipment having been removed from the wellhead, which the AP notes was never done. The document reads:  If (blowout preventer) and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions—the rate could be as high as ~100,000 barrels per day up the casing or 55,000 barrels per day up the annulus (low probability worst cases).",BP: Well Could Gush 100K Barrels a Day

Dr. Johnnie Barto of Johnstown pleaded guilty on Thursday to sexually abusing two family members and admitted to sexually assaulting more than two dozen patients. The abuse spanned decades and typically involved girls and boys between ages 8 and 12. One of the victims was 2 weeks old. The attorney general's office says Barto molested children in the exam room at Laurel Pediatric Associates in Cambria County and at local hospitals. The 71-year-old was arrested in January and remains behind bars pending his sentencing. His medical license has been suspended.

"(Dec 18, 2013  4:04 PM) It's official: Congress has sent President Obama a bipartisan budget deal that scales back across-the-board spending cuts on programs ranging from the Pentagon to the national park system. The final vote on the two-year measure was 64-36 in the Senate. The House approved the bill last week. The legislation is designed to prevent the kind of budget brinkmanship that has prevailed over the past three years of divided government and that led to this October's partial government shutdown. The White House supports the bill, and Obama's signature is assured. The legislation, which cleared the Republican-controlled House by a wide margin, met the short-term political needs of Republicans, Democrats, and the White House. As a result, there was no suspense about the outcome of the vote in the Senate—only about fallout in the 2014 elections and, more immediately, its impact on future congressional disputes over spending and the nation's debt limit.",Senate Passes 2-Year Budget Deal
"(Feb 28, 2019  7:56 AM) Women in Europe have it best, legally-speaking. Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg, and Sweden are the only countries that offer legal equality for men and women, according to a report by the World Bank. It looked at 35 indicators related to jobs, marriage, personal safety, property ownership, travel, inheritance, and more, reports Quartz, and those six countries scored a perfect 100. Among the questions considered:  Is a married woman not legally required to obey her husband?   Is there paid [maternity] leave of at least 14 weeks available to women?  With a score of 83.75, the US sits behind Mexico, Colombia, and Zimbabwe. Axios points out the US doesn't number among the first 60 countries on the list of 187 countries. The global average is 74.71 out of 100, which means  a typical economy only gives women three-quarters the rights of men in the measured areas,  World Bank interim president Kristalina Georgieva writes in an introduction to the report. The silver lining is progress: No countries could boast of legal equality among the sexes a decade ago, when the global average was 70.06, and all but 56 have made strides since then. Sub-saharan Africa passed 71 laws addressing women in the workplace, workplace harassment, and domestic violence over the decade. Just 19 similar reforms were passed in the Middle East and North Africa, where women still have less than half the rights men do, per Reuters. Nine countries are very close to equality: Canada, Finland, and Spain are among those with scores of 97.5. (See the best US states for women.)",6 Nations Have Legal Equality Among Sexes.

"(Jul 10, 2015  8:33 AM CDT) What should have been a generous charity event turned deadly today when hundreds of people stormed a free clothing giveaway, leaving at least 23 dead and dozens injured in Bangladesh, the AP reports. A senior police official says that toll could rise, since  some people had taken the bodies of their relatives before police arrived,  AFP reports. Based on witness and police reports cited in the AP and BBC, between 1,000 and 1,500 people had gathered before sunrise outside of where the handout was set to take place. Some reports say the site was a chewing tobacco factory compound, while the AP reports it was the home of a tobacco businessman. It's also unclear based on various reports whether the crowd forced their way through the gates or if the rush happened when the gates were opened. What is clear is the devastation that took place once the stampede started. The BBC notes TV images showed  hundreds of blood-spattered sandals lying at the factory gate,  while AFP reports of relatives rushing through the entrance to find the bodies of loved ones. Such giveaways are common during the holy month of Ramadan, when wealthy families offer up their hand-me-downs to the less fortunate, and similar stampedes have happened in the past, the Guardian notes. PM Sheikh Hasina offered prayers and  profound sympathy  to the victims' families, while the country's religious affairs ministry said it would be giving around $125 each to the families of the deceased for funeral costs.

The US has ordered its citizens to leave the country immediately. The president of South Sudan—the world's newest country—has blamed the violence on a failed coup attempt by soldiers loyal to his former deputy, who belongs to a different ethnic group. As tens of thousands of people seek refuge at UN compounds in the capital, there are  disturbing reports of ethnically-targeted killings,  with most of the fighting pitting soldiers from President Salva Kiir's majority Dinka tribe against those from former deputy Riek Machar's Nuer tribe, says the South Sudan analyst for the International Crisis Group.

Cute little kids making five or ten dollars is a little bit different than making hundreds. You've got coolers and coolers here,  the inspector grumbled. The fine was reportedly issued after they ignored several warnings.

"(Jul 6, 2010  7:49 AM CDT) Democrats are feeling the wrath of a financial sector scorned. Wall Street donations to the Democrats’ two congressional campaign committees are down 65% from the 2008 election cycle, the Washington Post reports. Big donors in general are staying away, giving just $49.5 million, compared to $81.3 million in 2008. Smaller donations have filled the gap—the funds are down only 16% overall—but party leaders are still concerned. Part of the problem is that the well-connected Chuck Schumer isn’t headlining the Democratic Senatorial committee anymore. But financial reform is a much bigger factor, says the committee’s current chair.  It’s no secret the big banks were against it.

But these are no ordinary immigrants. For the first time, Ko Yong Suk and husband Ri Gang are revealing their identities: as aunt and uncle to Kim Jong Un. Those names are their Korean ones; in a bid to protect their privacy, the Washington Post isn't sharing the names they use here or the town where they live in a house paid for with $200,000 they say was given to them by the CIA. But the paper is sharing plenty of tidbits it gained in nearly 20 hours of interviews about the Hermit Kingdom—like Kim's real age. Ko, the 60-year-old sister of Kim's late mother, says Kim was born in 1984, not 1982 or 1983 as thought. And she's sure of that, as her own son was born that year.  I changed both of their diapers,  she says. While the couple doesn't have  any nuclear or military secrets  to share, they do know a lot about the man they repeatedly called  Marshal Kim Jong Un,  including that he was groomed to be leader from age 8. Top generals even attended his birthday party and bowed to him, according to the pair. As for his love of basketball, Ko says Kim's mother told him playing the sport would help him grow taller, closing the height gap between him and his friends. As for their 1998 decision to defect, made while they were living in Switzerland,  this is where Ko and Ri's version of events starts to become opaque,  the Post writes.

The new figure follows a meeting in which economic experts predicted a loss of 4 million jobs next year and an unemployment rate of 9%. Obama's proposed stimulus package calls for up to $775 billion in spending, but a growing chorus of experts says even that's not enough. A top Obama aide predicted the downturn will be  more severe than anything we’ve experienced in the past half-century.

"(Mar 26, 2020  2:21 AM CDT) The Trump administration has been controversially referring to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as the  Chinese virus  or  Wuhan virus,  and three officials from G7 countries tell the Washington Post that Mike Pompeo's insistence on using the term  Wuhan virus  led to a rift at Wednesday's Group of Seven meeting, which was held via video conference. Per ABC News, foreign ministers were planning to issue a joint declaration on the virus, but Pompeo insisted the term  Wuhan virus,  which has been decried by world leaders and health organizations, be included. Because of that, the ministers failed to agree on a joint statement, and no statement specifically referencing the pandemic was issued. Meanwhile, the president himself has stopped calling it the  Chinese virus  because, he says,  Everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it.   We tried, you’ll remember, from the opening days to get our scientists, our experts on the ground there so that we could begin to assist in the global response to what began there in China, but we weren’t able to do that. The Chinese Communist Party wouldn’t permit that to happen,  Pompeo said at the meeting.  The Chinese Communist Party poses a substantial threat to our health and way of life, as the Wuhan virus outbreak clearly has demonstrated.  After the meeting, Pompeo downplayed the role of the term in the group's discussions, saying there were simply  tactical differences  in how ministers wanted to approach the situation.  Make no mistake about it,  he said, per Fox News,  everyone in that meeting this morning was very focused on making sure that we not only solve the health crisis associated with the Wuhan virus but also the economic challenges that face the globe as we confront it as well.","At G7, Pompeo's Insistence on 'Wuhan Virus' Caused Rift"

Figuring he's driven about 3.5 million miles since 1949 between a Salt Lake depot and smaller, rural offices, Lund says he took the timeworn post-office motto ( Neither snow, nor rain... ) very seriously. In fact, he recalls a delivery that was impeded by four feet of snow on a mountain south of Panguitch.  The highway patrolman told me I couldn't go, and I said, 'This is a mail truck and you can't stop me unless it’s impossible,' and I fooled him, I guess, because he let me go,  says Lund.

This time, the whole thing hinges on four words, the New York Times editorial board writes. In a subsection, the law says that health care subsidies should come from an exchange  established by the State.  But 36 states didn't set up exchanges, prompting the federal government to do so instead. The legal challenge holds that thanks to those four words, people in those 36 states can't receive subsidies. This is a superficial tactic, the Times notes. The Supreme Court has previously said that it  must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.  The case could come down, once again, to John Roberts, writes Noah Feldman at BloombergView.

She could be released as soon as June 10, CNN reports. Warmus was found guilty of killing Betty Jeanne Solomon; Warmus was a schoolteacher in her twenties having an affair with Solomon's husband, Paul, who was 17 years older. He worked with Warmus at a Westchester County elementary school. Prosecutors said Warmus grew tired of waiting for Solomon to leave his wife, who was shot nine times in her home. The first trial ended in a hung jury, but Warmus was convicted of second-degree murder the next year. The sensational trial spawned TV movies and documentaries, and was widely referred to as the  Fatal Attraction  case after the 1987 Michael Douglas-Glenn Close movie of that name. Prosecutors said Warmus had developed an obsessive attachment to her lover, per the New York Post. After killing his wife, they said, Warmus met Paul Solomon at a hotel bar and had sex with him in his car. She has long claimed to be innocent of the slaying; at an earlier parole hearing, Warmus blamed media attention for her conviction. She has told CNN she was  collateral damage  in a setup; Paul Solomon was a suspect at the time. Warmus said in 2016 that she'd get a different verdict in this era, per CBS:  I'm in prison for 25 years to life because I dated a married man.

Flight 5763, a regional flight operated by Compass Airlines, was en route from Southern California's Orange County to Seattle when the turbulence hit; a storm is currently hitting the Lake Tahoe area, and the National Weather Service has warned that  this is a particularly dangerous situation for aviation in the lee of the Sierra over the next few days.  Joe Justice, a passenger on the flight, provided photos and video of the aftermath on Twitter, calling the turbulence  insane.  Justice says a beverage cart  went all the way up to the ceiling, roughly, more than once, as did the flight attendant.  Another passenger tells Fox News,  We just saw the drink cart go up in the air. The flight attendant was tossed around like a rag doll. It was wild.  Two of the injured passengers and one injured flight attendant were taken to a hospital, CNN reports; their conditions have not yet been released. Two others were checked out by medics and declined to go to the hospital, the Seattle Times reports. Officials said all passengers were conscious. Delta provided food, an alternate flight to Seattle, and refunds to all 59 passengers, NBC News reports. Four crew members were also on board.

"(Jul 6, 2011  11:05 AM CDT) Pyeongchang, South Korea, won the 2018 Winter Olympics in the first round of voting, the International Olympic Committee announced today. Pyeongchang was up against Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France, but was the favorite and had even been speculated to win in the first round. It was the first time since 1995 that a bid race with more than two finalists was decided in the first round, the Wall Street Journal reports. Pyeongchang also led in the first rounds for both the 2010 and 2014 games, but lost both. Its slogan this time around was  New Horizons,  noting that its culture is not well-known to many around the world. Other than cities in Japan, which hosted in both 1972 and 1998, Pyeongchang will be the first Asian city to host the Winter Games.",South Korea Gets 2018 Olympics
"(Feb 8, 2011  8:53 AM) The field of GOP presidential candidates for 2012 may not be so great, but the VP field is getting the right energized. A wealth of new Congress members and governors has Republicans buzzing over potential veeps like Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal and Kelly Ayotte, Politico reports. Where the potential presidential candidates are mostly white, male, and not from battleground states, the would-be veeps boast an impressive diversity when it comes to race, gender, geographical location, and political experience—and they’re young, with many under 50 and one under 40.  Anytime that you have a hugely successful year, like we had in 2010, we put a lot of dynamic candidates on the board,  says Mike Huckabee’s 2008 campaign manager. That’s quite a difference from 2008, when the GOP was struggling with the aftermath of disappointing elections in 2006 and John McCain had few choices for a running mate. Republicans elected just three new senators and five new governors between 2006 and 2008—compared to 15 new governors and 14 new senators in 2010 alone. Other potential candidates include governors Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Susana Martinez, and Rick Perry, among many others.",GOP Fired Up Over 2012 VP Candidates
"(Jun 16, 2015  2:27 AM CDT) Once again, an American drone strike has apparently created some room at the top in al-Qaeda. The group's Yemen branch, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has confirmed that its leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, was killed in a strike last week, reports the Washington Post. Wuhayshi, who was reportedly groomed by Osama bin Laden, became al-Qaeda's No. 2 leader when he took charge of the highly active—and dangerous—Yemen franchise in 2013. He was filmed calling for attacks on the US at a large gathering of militants last year.  We must eliminate the cross,  he said, and  the bearer of the cross is America.  The SITE Intelligence Group describes the death as the biggest strike on al-Qaeda since the 2011 killing of bin Laden, the BBC reports. The possible death of the leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Libya in a US airstrike over the weekend makes this a very bad week for the group's leadership, former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel tells the Post. The men were among the few left with strong ties to the group's founders,  but the ideology, the message, and the mythology they created now outlives them, and I don't think their passage is really going to be the end of this problem,  he says.

Then, just a few months later, the engineer's stay-at-home husband Ben learned his Hodgkin's lymphoma had returned for the third time.  It's just shocking, you know?  Shelby's younger brother tells WZZM13.  At first it just seemed like a terrible dream.  The young Michigan parents, who are going through chemo and radiation treatments together, are doing what they can to simultaneously parent their 3-year-old, Maeve, and 1-year-old, Hazel. Ben will likely require a bone marrow transplant, but won't be able to undergo the procedure until his cancer is in remission, and his first round of chemo was unsuccessful, reports Fox 6. Meanwhile, doctors are doing what they can to at least slow the progression of Shelby's cancer, which has spread to her brain, though she was well enough to go home on her 31st birthday on Friday, according to the family's YouCaring fundraising site.

"(Sep 9, 2019  1:21 AM CDT) After Pennsylvania couple Robert and Tiffany Williams received an unexpected windfall of $120,000, they went on a massive spending spree over the next two-and-a-half weeks, police say. One problem: The money wasn't theirs. Police say that after a BB&T bank teller accidentally deposited the $120,000 in their account on May 31, the couple spent more than $100,000 between June 3 and June 19, buying an SUV, a camper, a car trailer, and a race car, the Williamsport Sun-Gazette reports. They also allegedly used the money to pay off bills and distribute $15,000 to friends in need. State Trooper Aaron Brown says that when the error was detected around June 20, the money was pulled from the Williams' account, leaving them with an overdraft of more than $107,000. The bank says that when it contacted Tiffany Williams, she promised to speak to her husband and set up a repayment plan. The bank says it called the police in July after further attempts to contact the couple failed. Robert Williams, 36, and Tiffany Williams, 35, face felony charges of theft and receiving stolen property. Their neighbors in Montoursville say they are surprised the couple didn't call the bank when the money appeared in their account.

Inspectors found just 12 personnel at the Kunduz province base camp, which had been built for 175 officers. Most of the buildings appeared unused and equipment like wood-burning stoves had already been dismantled. The investigators had to peer through windows of most of the buildings because the personnel on site only had keys to three of them, ABC reports. The inspectors recommended that the US Army take another look at plans for building other border police facilities to ensure they are appropriately sized. Their report noted that sustaining the Kunduz facility would require people with the skills to maintain electrical generators, fueling stations, and water treatment systems, but there are no plans in place to train anybody.",$7.3M US-Built Afghan Police Camp Sits Nearly Empty
"(Jan 11, 2019  7:50 AM) One of two children considered missing after their family's SUV sped off a Northern California cliff in March has been confirmed dead. DNA tests on a partial foot recovered near the crash site in Westport in May confirmed it to be that of 16-year-old Hannah Hart, the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Married parents Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, and three of six adopted children—Markis, 19, Abigail, 14, and Jeremiah, 14—were confirmed dead as the vehicle was discovered on March 26, 2018. Remains of a fourth child, 12-year-old Ciera, were found in April, but Hannah, 16, and Devonte, 15, remained missing. The test on the partial foot, found inside a shoe attached to a pair of jeans, was made possible as the biological mother of Markis, Abigail, and Hannah emerged in October to provide a DNA sample, reports KGW. As the sheriff's department has  not received any indication of Devonte being located elsewhere … the most likely scenario is that he too perished in this incident but the case remains open and active,  per a release. Authorities have described the crash at the cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway as intentional. Jennifer's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit when investigators say she accelerated off the cliff without braking. Sarah and some of the children were sedated, per CNN. The family had set out from Woodland, Wash., days earlier as child-welfare officials looked for them.

By 2022, say company officials, McDonald's will no longer buy pork from suppliers who use  gestation crates —narrow stalls in which breeding sows spend much of their lives. The company—which buys some 1% of all pork produced in the US—says that by 2017, it will only purchase pork from sources that have already begun the process of phasing out the stalls, reports the Wall Street Journal. Getting rid of the stalls, which are too small to allow the pigs to turn around in, has long been a key demand of animal welfare groups.  We wish the company planned to get rid of these crates tomorrow, but we understand the logistical challenges involved in making such significant improvements,  said a Humane Society spokesman.

"(Dec 4, 2014  8:14 AM) In July 1994, Sophie Serrano's newborn was put in a hospital incubator as part of the infant's treatment for jaundice. Baby Manon wasn't alone: A second baby girl suffering from jaundice shared the incubator. When the French girls were removed, they were accidentally switched by a nurse whom the Cannes clinic has since blamed, saying she had alcohol issues. The Local and RFI report that the mothers were immediately concerned: Their babies' hair lengths seemed changed, and Serrano pointed out that the baby she had been handed appeared to have darker skin; staff told her the skin difference was a result of the lamps the infant had been exposed to in the incubator. The lack of resemblance only grew with time, to the point that, when Manon was 10, her father got a paternity test and the truth unraveled. Serrano ultimately learned her biological daughter (who has chosen to remain anonymous) was living just 20 miles away, and the two families met. They chose not to switch back the girls, and the meetings petered out.  The social, educational, and cultural differences (between the two families), added to the pain of our unconscious rivalry, took their toll on our relations,  says Serrano. Now the families are suing—again. They initially went after the clinic after the swap surfaced a decade ago, but the statute of limitations rendered their case toothless. But on Tuesday they filed a civil suit against the clinic, two obstetricians, two pediatricians, and a nurse. They want about $15 million dollars, with nearly $4 million earmarked for each girl, and roughly $900,000 going to each of their siblings.

But police say his creepy reign has finally come to an end, reports MLive. Officers say they arrested 54-year-old Steven Pastoor near a highway, naked from the waist down. Investigators with the Kent County Sheriff's Department say he confessed to being the town's serial flasher after his arrest.  We believe him to be responsible for several dozen indecent exposures over the last almost 20 years,  says Lt. Joel Roon, per WOOD-TV. Authorities say the flasher would typically knock on the door or window of a home, or sometimes stand on the side of a road, then masturbate when he had someone's attention. He typically wore a hat and shirt, but no pants. Police say their break came when he began knocking on the same woman's door in 2018. Security cameras at her house helped police identify Pastoor as a suspect, and deputies began surveillance.

A neighbor tells FOX 46 Charlotte that local residents asked whether search teams had looked in one particular area near Rankin Lake Park yet; when crews started searching that area Thursday, a body was found around 1pm. Ian Ritch said he and a friend, who has not been publicly identified, were visiting the park for the first time with Maddox, who has autism and is non-verbal, when the boy took off running; Ian Ritch said he is diabetic and has neuropathy in his feet, leaving him unable to keep up with the boy.

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have  replenished the account  in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports.

Opposition leader Henrique Capriles has urged supporters not to follow calls for a  national blockade,  but he has demanded the release of jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez and other demonstrators, as well as the disarming of pro-government gangs—including the motorcycle gangs blamed for some protesters' deaths. Amid the country's worst unrest in a decade, Capriles rejected an invitation to meet Maduro, reports Reuters.  This is a dying government ...

That may have been the philosophy guiding an Oregon homeowner who the Coos County Sheriff's Office says found three 14-year-old boys attempting to burglarize his Coos Bay residence on Sunday, KATU reports.

Police showed up to carry out their duty, arresting the teens on charges including burglary, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, theft, and marijuana possession, per the Coos Bay World. The boys ended up in a local juvenile detention facility, while the 8-year-old stepsister of one of the boys (he was supposed to be babysitting her and apparently let her tag along) was brought home to her parents.

"(Apr 14, 2012  6:08 AM CDT) The White House has settled with 41 Indian tribes to the tune of $1.023 billion in disputes over the federal mismanagement of trust funds and resources, reports Indian Country. Some of the disputes are more than 100 years old. It's among the largest financial settlements to Indian tribes in the US, made because the Interior and Treasury departments failed to properly oversee concessions on Indian lands for natural resources, including minerals, timber, oil, and gas. In addition, the Interior Department, which oversees 100,000 leases and 2,500 trust accounts for hundreds of tribes, has agreed to a new accounting system to avoid these disputes in the future. A complicated formula will determine each tribe's payout, reports the New York Times, which will range from $380 million for the 16,000-member Osage tribe in Oklahoma to just $2 million to the 40,000-member Minnesota Chippewa tribe. About 60 similar lawsuits remain outstanding. The chairman of the Coeur d’Alene tribe of Idaho praised the Obama administration.

A prime and much publicized example was that of Michael L. Johnson, now 25, a Lindenwood University wrestling star at the time of his 2013 arrest who is serving 30.5 years for  recklessly  infecting a male partner with HIV and exposing four others to it. Or, was: On Tuesday, a new trial was ordered for Johnson by a Missouri appeals court, which overturned his conviction after finding the trial court did indeed  abuse its discretion  in airing portions of jailhouse phone calls Johnson made that the defense didn't get access to until the morning of the trial's first day. In Missouri's case, not disclosing your HIV status to a partner, as Johnson's accusers alleged and he denied, can be a felony. The ACLU of Missouri is backing Johnson, and as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, flagged what it (and others) perceive to be problems with the conviction and sentence: that the  law under which he is charged is based on outdated science.  Critics of such laws cite significant medical advances and note that while the person with HIV faces legal repercussions, the partner who chose to have unprotected sex does not, reported BuzzFeed last year. BuzzFeed separately reports on what was in those taped calls: Johnson saying his level of confidence that he had alerted his partners to his status was  pretty sure.  The court pointed out it was  the only evidence in the record of Johnson stating to anyone that he was not certain,  making it  highly prejudicial evidence  that Johnson's defense should have had time to prepare to for.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Joe Biden gave an intriguing answer to the question of whether he plans a 2020 White House run.  I haven't decided to run,  he said,  but I've decided I'm not going to decide not to run. We’ll see what happens.  The former vice president said that if it hadn't been for the illness of his son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in May 2015 at age 46, there is  no question  he would have run in 2016.  I had planned on running, and I wasn’t running against Hillary or Bernie or anybody else. Honest to God, I thought that I was the best suited for the moment to be president.  He said he felt that Clinton was a  prisoner of history,  and there never seemed to be any joy in her campaign. Biden's new memoir, Promise Me, Dad, will be released this fall. It covers the time from Beau's 2013 diagnosis to the aftermath of his death. In the Vanity Fair interview, Biden said he kept the option of a run open in 2015 partly to keep Beau—who once told him it was his duty to run—optimistic.  It would have bothered Beau a great deal if I’d not run because of him,  he said. Biden's wife, Jill, said she now often wonders what Beau would have wanted.

"(Sep 19, 2016  9:47 AM CDT) For more than 50 years, scientists have been gathering foxes from the Russian wilderness and breeding them, picking the most human-friendly to mate to domesticate the supposedly untamable animals, much as dogs once were, Phys.org reports. And it looks like the project the BBC says was started by Dmitry Belyae and his intern, Lyudmila Trut, has been a success: By the fourth generation of foxes, the animals were acting much like socialized dogs, wagging their tails and seeking human contact, and they'd physically changed, too, with droopier ears, shorter legs and snouts, and higher serotonin levels, which may have dampened aggressiveness. In the late 1950s Belyae and Trut set out to domesticate a species from the ground up—in a country that Live Science notes banned the study of genetics in 1948, with severe punishments for those who flouted the law. In the beginning, the researchers pretended they were breeding foxes for their fur (and they did kill for fur those foxes that weren't docile enough to continue mating for their real experiment). What's interesting is that the foxes on the farm weren't  tamed,  per se, which is learned behavior not passed down to the next generation, Popular Science explained in 2013. Rather, a 2009 paper by Trut (Belyae died in 1985, and Trut, now in her 80s, has been running the project since) notes that the meticulously selective breeding led to the neurological and endocrinal changes the foxes underwent, per Discover. Now that the foxes have been domesticated, Trut's next task is to isolate the genes that are altered during this process.

Nixon rose to prominence during the '60s and '70s, and NPR describes her as one of the only powerful women in the entertainment industry during that era. Just like Nixon herself, two of her more famous creations were well-loved and and long-lived: All My Children ran for over four decades, while One Life To Live aired for 44 seasons. Both ended in 2011. Nixon was well-known for using her shows to draw attention to controversial social issues. Her plots addressed everything from cancer to abortion to homosexuality, issues often elided by many TV shows of the era. As the New York Times notes, Susan Lucci's character on All My Children was the first on TV to have a legal abortion—in 1973, just after Roe v. Wade.  I wasn't trying to change the genre, I was just trying to write what I thought, what was interesting to me,  Nixon told NPR in 2010. The Washington Post asserts that she  quietly made soap operas relevant,  noting that a story line she wrote about a Guiding Light character's uterine cancer in 1962 is considered the first health plot in a daytime drama. Alumni of her shows have responded to Nixon's death with an outpouring of love, support, and admiration, notes the Los Angeles Times, which rounds up examples of the tributes to the woman known as  Amazing Agnes.

When researchers asked,  How old was your child when he/she did these activities on a mobile media device?  here's what they found among the  under one year  category:  We didn't expect children were using the devices from the age of 6 months,  says lead author Hilda Kabali, and  some children were on the screen for as long as 30 minutes.  In fact, by the age of one year, 14% of kids logged usage of at least an hour a day. Further, the survey responses indicate  most children are using [mobile devices] by age two years,  though Time points to the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation that kids under two not have exposure. Why is it happening? The researchers did ask when the children used the devices, and got these answers: while running errands (60%), while the parent was doing chores (73%), when the child needed to be calmed (65%), and to put the child to sleep (29%). The findings were presented Saturday at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting. (A recent study warns against handing your toddler an iPad.)",We're Letting Our 6-Month-Olds Use Smartphones

"(Mar 7, 2019  1:53 AM) The Democratic National Committee has banned Fox News from hosting any of the party's 2020 debates, saying the network is  not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates.  DNC Chairman Tom Perez said the decision was made after a New Yorker report on the network's extremely close relationship with President Trump, reports the Washington Post. The party wants to expand its electorate and  reach all voters,  Perez said in a statement, but the  inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration, and Fox News  made it an unsuitable partner for the primary debates. Fox—which didn't host any Democratic primary debates in 2016, but hosted town hall meetings with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders—had sent proposals to the DNC to host one of the 12 primary debates scheduled so far, the Guardian reports. Fox said in a statement that it hoped the DNC would reconsider the decision, which would affect respected anchors like Chris Wallace, Bret Baier, and Martha MacCallum, Mediaite reports. Trump, meanwhile, threatened to retaliate on the network's behalf.  Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate,  he tweeted.

But is a Britney comeback possible in the new world of pop, where Ke$ha (who can certainly  offer a few dance hooks in a girl-gone-wild package ) and Lady Gaga (who  has almost single-handedly reinvented the blonde dance beast aesthetic ) have swept in and taken over the spot once held by Brit, wonders Mary Elizabeth Williams on Salon.  As a colleague mused recently, Britney after Gaga is like going back to the greatest bar in your midsize hometown after a year in Manhattan. It's still comfortable; it just doesn't seem as eye-popping,  Williams continues. It might help if Britney offered up some introspection on her new album, but if the single is any indication, all we’re going to get is the same old  glitter and earworms and aggressive come-ons.

AMC Theaters, the chain their cinema spawned, plans to charge the same price when it reopens theaters next week. The company says it will reopen around 100 locations Aug. 20 in cities including Atlanta, Dallas, and Miami, with 15-cent tickets on opening day for legacy titles including Black Panther, Ghostbusters, and The Empire Strikes Back, Variety reports. AMC says that under its phased reopening plan, it aims to have two-thirds of its 600 or so locations nationwide open in time for the Sept. 3 release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet.

"(Mar 30, 2011  8:06 AM CDT) An Illinois woman ended up a lot closer to nature than planned during a sightseeing trip in the Florida Keys when an eagle ray leaped right into her tour boat, pinning her to the floor.  It happened so fast, in a split second,  Jenny Hausch, who had been taking photos of the ray moments earlier, tells the Keynoter.  It hit me in the chest and knocked me back.  Hausch managed to free herself, and wildlife officers who heard screams arrived soon afterward. Eagle rays can weigh up to 500 pounds; Hausch believes this one weighed at least 300.

"(Jan 31, 2016  5:54 AM) American and Mexican authorities cooperated in a daylong cross-border raid that resulted in the arrest of 24 alleged high-level members of Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel, reports the AP. The sting known as Mexican Operation Diablo Express took place all of Friday as numerous law enforcement agencies converged onto Lukeville, Ariz., which sits on the Mexican border. Homeland Security Investigations, a unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helped Mexican authorities nab the cartel members, who were operating around Sonoyta, Mexico, and the US border, ICE rep Gillian Christensen said. The DEA, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and Arizona state and local agencies were on hand.  This operation was conducted with utmost secrecy to maintain the element of surprise and to ensure the safety of the Mexican law enforcement officers executing it,  Christensen said, per CNN. ICE helped Mexican federal police into the US to keep them safe during the operation, Christensen said. The sting also netted the seizure of several assault-type weapons and hundreds of pounds of drugs.  ICE applauds the government of Mexico for their bold action in taking down this criminal organization and for their continued pressure on the Sinaloa Cartel throughout Mexico,  Christensen said. The arrests are the latest blow to the Sinaloa Cartel after the arrest of El Chapo on Jan. 8. The 24 people arrested Friday have not been identified.

"(Nov 5, 2014  1:44 PM) The obvious big winner in last night's election is Mitch McConnell. But observers see two less-obvious victors in Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie. At Vox, for example, Ezra Klein writes that  a more Democratic year could have led to some new stars who might have been able to challenge  Clinton in 2016. The GOP wave took care of that. Andrew Romano at Yahoo goes further, arguing that  almost everything  about the results— the map, the math and the legislative morass that lies ahead in the run-up to 2016—suggests that the former first lady and secretary of state will have a better next two years than the party currently guzzling champagne.  One of Romano's points is that in 2016, the Senate races up for grabs look more favorable to Democrats, which should give her an electoral boost. As for Christie, as head of the Republican Governors' Association, he can take a big share of the credit for GOP gubernatorial candidates' great success last night.  He can now argue not only that he has personally won elections in a blue state but that he led a bunch of other Republicans to win hard elections in blue states,  writes Klein.  That's going to be a powerful argument to make to Republicans in 2016.  One more observation on Clinton, via Jonathan Chait at New York: Given that the GOP now controls the House and Senate, he writes that she is now  the only thing standing between a Republican Party even more radical than George W. Bush’s version and unfettered control of American government.","2 More Election Winners: Christie, Clinton"

Southern Cross Austereo will fork over a minimum of $525,000 to a memorial fund, reports Reuters; it had suspended all advertising in the wake of Saldanha's death, but will resume Thursday.

"(Oct 17, 2013  6:58 PM CDT) The US Justice Department today brought fresh charges against four former Blackwater Worldwide security contractors, resurrecting an internationally charged case over a deadly 2007 shooting on the streets of Baghdad. A new jury indictment charges the men in a shooting that inflamed anti-American sentiment in Iraq and heightened diplomatic sensitivities amid an ongoing war. The men were hired to guard US diplomats. The guards are accused of opening fire in busy Nisoor Square on Sept. 16, 2007. Seventeen Iraqi civilians died, including women and children. Prosecutors say the heavily armed Blackwater convoy used machine guns and grenades in an unprovoked attack. Defense lawyers argue their clients are innocent men who were ambushed by Iraqi insurgents. The guards were charged with manslaughter and weapons violations in 2008, but a federal judge the following year dismissed the case, ruling the Justice Department withheld evidence from a grand jury and violated the guards' constitutional rights. The dismissal outraged many Iraqis, who said it showed Americans consider themselves above the law. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Baghdad in 2010, expressed his  personal regret  for the shootings. A federal appeals court reinstated the case in 2011, saying now-retired Judge Ricardo Urbina had wrongly interpreted the law. Prosecutors again presented evidence before a grand jury, and US District Judge Royce Lamberth gave the Justice Department until Monday to decide what to do with the case.",New Charges in 2007 Blackwater Shootings

"(Sep 3, 2019  6:18 PM CDT) Cancer is now the No. 1 cause of death in wealthy countries, killing twice as many people as heart disease—which remains the leading cause of death for middle-aged adults worldwide, Reuters reports. A new study finds that this  epidemiological transition  is at play in  rich world  countries including Sweden, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Poland, and Turkey; researchers theorize that could be due to improvements in prevention and treatment of heart disease in those countries, CNN reports.  As cardiovascular disease declines in many countries, cancer mortality is likely to become the leading cause of death in the future  across the globe, the study's senior author says, per Fox News. Overall, cardiovascular disease (a group of ailments including heart failure, angina, heart attack, and stroke) kills 40% of all adults aged 35-70 worldwide, with cancer in the No. 2 spot at 26%, the study found. But in high-income countries, the prevalence of cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medication has brought cardiovascular disease rates down significantly. In middle-income and low-income countries, researchers found heart disease medication use was much lower. Among the study's limitations, however, is the fact that it did not look at every country in the world. The US was not included, but a study last year found that while heart disease was more likely to kill those in low-income US counties, cancer was more likely to kill those in high-income counties.",There's a New No. 1 Killer in the Rich World

But it didn’t work; as we learned yesterday, she and her four grown daughters exercised their family veto power and nixed a Daniels 2012 run. Insiders say Cheri simply couldn’t come to terms with the scrutiny of her marriage and mothering; she and Mitch divorced in 1993 and remarried in 1997—and Cheri married another man in California in the years between.

The New York Times reports that this has been worst summer for the film industry in North America since 1997. Ticket sales from May through August are expected to come in at $3.9 billion, down 15% from last year. While movies such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Angelina Jolie's Maleficient, and Scarlett Johansson's Lucy did relatively well, supposed blockbusters such as Edge of Tomorrow and Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn't meet expectations, and sequels in general didn't seem to have the lure they once did. Studios will surely counter that ticket sales must be counted worldwide now, not just in North America, but  what they do not often mention is that overseas ticket sales are often less profitable,  writes Brooks Barnes.  In China, for instance, as little as 25 cents of every box office dollar comes back to Hollywood; in the United States, it’s 50 percent.  So is this a sign of things to come? Don't bet on it, reports Vox, which quotes BoxOffice.com analyst Phil Contrino as saying 2014 was just an off year.

One other leading theory: All eight lived at the same nursing facility and might have consumed something there that made them ill, reports KTVU. As of Monday, all but one of the five hospitalized patients had been released.

"(Apr 24, 2019  8:49 AM CDT) Canadian trash has been sitting at a port in the Philippines for more than five years, and President Rodrigo Duterte wants it gone—or else. Duterte's word choices tend to grab headlines, and this instance is no exception:  I'll give a warning to Canada maybe next week that they better pull that [trash] out,  he said Tuesday.  We'll declare war against them, we can handle them anyway.  CNN reports the issue is the 2013 and 2014 shipment of 2,450 tons of what were supposed to be recyclable plastic scraps. But inspectors in Manila say what was in the 103 containers couldn't be processed—the AP reports there was reportedly plastic bottles inside, but also things like used adult diapers and other household trash—and some of the containers are still sitting there. The BBC reports the shipment was made by a private company based in Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a 2015 visit to the country that Canada could not legally force that company to act. The Canadian Press reports Canada's efforts have mainly centered around getting the Philippines to just accept the trash. In 2016, a Filipino court ruled it had to go back to Canada. Trudeau has previously said he is  very much engaged in finding a solution.  Duterte offered one: He said he'd bring the garbage back himself.",Trash Shipped to Philippines in 2013 Leads to Threat of War
"(Jan 31, 2019  1:32 PM) Bernie Sanders wants to increase the top estate tax rate in the US to 77%. The senator, who is considering running for president again in 2020, unveiled legislation Thursday that would both expand and increase the estate tax, raising trillions. From Bloomberg, Business Insider, and the Hill: Sanders said in a statement that the bill, which he's calling the  For the 99.8% Act,  would only impact the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans, and would raise up to $2.2 trillion from just the families of the 588 US billionaires whose combined net worth is more than $3 trillion.  Our bill does what the American people want by substantially increasing the estate tax on the wealthiest families in this country and dramatically reducing wealth inequality,  he said.  From a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little.  He added that the top estate tax rate was 77% from 1941 to 1976.

The victims include at least 21 children and four adults killed in the collapse of the Enrique Rabsamen primary school in Mexico City's Coapa neighborhood, the Guardian reports. On Tuesday evening, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the site, where rescuers occasionally paused their search to listen for voices in the rubble, the AP reports. The president said at least 30 children and eight adults are still missing. In a video message released later Tuesday, Pena Nieto urged Mexicans to stay calm.  The priority at this moment is to keep rescuing people who are still trapped and to give medical attention to the injured people,  he said. Civilian volunteers have joined rescue workers at many sites. Authorities say the quake collapsed at least 44 buildings in Mexico City alone, the Telegraph reports. It hit on the anniversary of a 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. Earlier in the day, workplaces and schools across Mexico City had marked the date by holding earthquake readiness drills.

Police say ex-cop Norris Greenhouse Jr., 23, and Marksville police Lt. Derrick Stafford, 32, were moonlighting as Marksville city marshals when they fired into a vehicle driven by Jeremy's father, Chris Few, who was unarmed, reports NBC News, which notes that the charges carry a mandatory punishment of life in prison without parole.

The court filing also confirmed that body camera video from the incident, which state police investigators have called  extremely disturbing,  shows that Few had his empty hands in the air when police opened fire, per KATC. Few was shot twice and critically injured, while his autistic son was shot five times and died at the scene.

"(Feb 24, 2016  1:18 AM) It's a huge blow for Johnson & Johnson, and a huge win for the family of a woman who blamed the company's products for her ovarian cancer. In St. Louis on Monday, a jury awarded $72 million to the family of Alabama's Jacqueline Fox: $10 million in actual damages and $62 million—$1 million for every year that she lived—in punitive damages, Courthouse News reports. Fox, who died in October but testified in a video deposition, said she used the company's talc-based Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products for feminine hygiene for 35 years. The family's lawyers said the company covered up evidence the products could cause cancer and the jury agreed, finding Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence, and conspiracy, reports Reuters. The evidence included internal memos that lawyers argued showed that Johnson & Johnson was aware of the link between talc and ovarian cancer for more than 30 years but covered it up. Fox's son, Marvin Salter, became the plaintiff after her death. He tells the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Johnson & Johnson was a company name he had trusted.  My reaction was disbelief,  he says.  How can a company have known about this relationship between talc and ovarian cancer since the 1970s and not disclosed it?  Fox's case was the first to go to court, but there are around 1,200 similar ones in Missouri and New Jersey.

Some 20 high school students were killed at the Kintampo waterfalls when a tree or trees (media reports differ on the number) fell at the top of the falls and toppled on them below, an official tells the AFP.  They were swimming in the river when there was a storm, a windy atmosphere that had uprooted some of the trees,  says a national fire service spokesman.  A huge tree fell at the top when the rains began and crashed the revelers,  a witness tells Starr FM. Rescue teams worked with chainsaws to clear those who were trapped.

"(Aug 20, 2014  2:15 PM CDT) A 200-year-old bottle of alcohol found in a shipwreck at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is still suitable for drinking—if you can get past its stink. The stoneware bottle, emblazoned with the name of a mineral water named Selters, was found off the Polish coast in the Gulf of Gdansk last year, LiveScience reports. Preliminary lab tests suggest at least a bit of the water was left in the bottle before it was refilled with liquor by boozy sailors, UPI speculates. That liquor may be a type of gin called jenever and it was diluted with water that matches Selters. Should archaeologists succumb to temptation and sip a little of the gin, the old alcohol won't poison them, but  it does not smell particularly good,  says one scientist. Selters soda water comes from the Taunus Mountains in Germany and was found 1,000 years ago, LiveScience explains. The bottle from the Gdansk wreck is from the early 19th century and originated 25 miles from Selters Springs; it was one of 2 million likely sold in the region's village shops, adds Science and Scholarship in Poland. The spring went dry in the early 19th century, but a new one was found in 1896; the water is still sold as a luxury product. The stinky concoction in the stoneware bottle will undergo more tests, as per UPI. LiveScience offers these pictures of the discovery.

"(Mar 18, 2016  6:50 PM CDT) Former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan was awarded $115 million by a jury Friday in his lawsuit against Gawker, which published a sex tape featuring the Hulkster in 2012, the AP reports. It's $15 million more than he was asking. According to Ars Technica, which points out punitive damages could still be added to the total, the loss in court could be a  life-threatening event  for Gawker, which has around 250 employees. Gawker published a video of Hogan having sex with the wife of his friend Todd Clem—aka Bubba the Love Sponge—made at Clem's insistence. Clem had recorded the encounter, possibly without Hogan's knowledge. Hogan cried when the jury revealed its findings after nearly six hours of deliberations, CNN reports. In their closing arguments Friday, Hogan's lawyers argued the video was a violation of his privacy.  Gawker took a secretly recorded sex tape and put it on the Internet,  the AP quotes Hogan's attorneys. Gawker's attorneys argued the site had a  legitimate news reason  for publishing the video as a  commentary on the ordinariness of celebrity sex videos.  One of the website's lawyers went on to warn that if Hogan's suit was successful,  the Internet as we know it will cease to exist.  In addition to Gawker, the jury found founder Nick Denton and former editor Albert Daulerio (who made headlines for saying he'd consider publishing the sex tape of anyone over the age of 5) personally liable. Gawker says it only made about $11,000 from publishing the sex tape and took outside investment for the first time to cover potential costs from the trial.",Hulk Hogan Gets $115M in Gawker Sex Tape Lawsuit

"(Nov 8, 2015  6:40 PM) Looks increasingly like last week's horrific Russian plane crash in Egypt—which killed all 224 passengers and crew—was caused by a bomb. An Egyptian investigator tells Reuters that his team is  90% sure it was a bomb  but refused to explain the uncertainty.  The indications and analysis so far of the sound on the black box indicate it was a bomb,  he says. His team's top investigator, Ayman al-Muqaddam, said yesterday that the plane was apparently on auto-pilot when it broke apart on its route from an Egyptian tourist resort to St. Petersburg on Oct. 31. A last-second noise heard on the cockpit recorder could have been a bomb, he said, unless it was metal fatigue, overheating batteries, or a fuel explosion. Meanwhile, CNN reports that a top US official calls the bomb theory  99.9% certain  and another says it's  likely.  And Rep. Peter King, who helms the Homeland Security subcommittee on terrorism and intelligence, tells the New York Times that  right now all the evidence points in that direction.  That would jibe with a claim from the Sinai affiliate of ISIS that it brought down the plane, and ISIS chatter picked up by the US and Britain to that effect, though US officials say such chatter is pretty typical. Regardless, Russia and Britain have already repatriated thousands of tourists from Egypt as a precautionary measure.

Police think he later drove to the Arcadia home where his nephews lived, per the Times. The boys had been left sleeping while their parents visited Shi's wife at the hospital. Later, the mother discovered one of the boys bleeding and unresponsive. Both boys suffered blunt-force trauma and were pronounced dead at the scene. While Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the US, the Times reports, the proceedings could be complicated if Shi will face the death penalty, which Hong Kong does not have.

"(Aug 29, 2011  11:34 AM CDT) The US has basically flushed $30 billion down the toilet, according to a bipartisan commission looking into the money spent on contracts and grants in Iraq and Afghanistan. It found that at least one out of every six dollars spent in the last 10 years has been money wasted. In a report to be submitted to Congress Wednesday, the commission finds that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were begun  without adequate planning or contract-management personnel to handle the enormous scale and numbers of contracts,  write the group’s heads. And just as much money could go to waste all over again if the countries’ governments can't or won't maintain US-funded programs after we leave: The report cites $300 million we spent on a power plant that the Afghan government lacks the funds and expertise to run as an example.  Poor planning, inadequate competition, lax accountability, and subpar performance, or outright misconduct by some contractors and federal employees  are among the issues the report confronts. And It’s not just money that has been wasted: Poor contract management also hurts  support for military, diplomatic, and development efforts  and helps breed corruption, write Christopher Shays and Michael Thibault in the Washington Post. The commission offers  15 strategic recommendations  to improve the situation, including creating new oversight positions and making better use of risk analysis.

One of the three was found dead. They had been on Okinawa island's northern coast when they were overcome by the waves, according to a rep for the Japanese coast guard's Okinawa branch. The Air Force said the search for the missing airmen had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives, reports the AP.

"(Feb 13, 2019  1:38 AM) The USS Hornet aircraft carrier had an extremely busy year and six days in service, taking part in key World War II events in the Pacific including the Battle of Midway and the Doolittle Raid before being sunk by Japanese forces in the Battle of Santa Cruz Island on Oct. 27, 1942. Now, almost 77 years later, the ship's resting place has finally been found. An expedition crew funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen located the shipwreck near the Solomon Islands late last month, NPR reports. The ship's remains were found almost 17,500 feet below the ocean surface with the help of naval reports from the era, scans from a deep-sea sonar drone, and a dive from an autonomous underwater vehicle. To protect the wreck, the exact location will be kept secret. Some 140 sailors died in the battle, though most of the 2,200 crew members were able to abandon the ship after it was badly damaged by Japanese bombers and torpedo planes.  I felt the heat and concussion from an explosion on the aft hangar deck. I glanced under my arm and saw burning shrapnel bounce up to me,  recalled survivor Wayne L. Cullen.  All hell was breaking loose.  Photos sent back from the wreck show anti-aircraft guns and military vehicles on the deck.

"(Dec 30, 2013  1:09 PM) Over the past three decades, 11 vehicles have crashed at the Indianapolis house where Leigh and Tim McCall live. The most recent accident occurred this week, when a Chevy Equinox came through one of the walls and missed Leigh, who was watching the Colts game in her living room with her husband, by less than a foot.  This time I thought she was dead, five inches away from it,  Tim McCall tells WTHR.  I had no idea how something didn't hit her.  Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt this time, but a previous crash is believed to have killed a man, a fire department spokesperson tells the Star. The problem appears to be a railroad crossing about 150 feet away. This time around, the driver says she was speeding when she went over the railroad tracks, lost control, overcorrected, and ended up going through the McCalls' dining room (as most of the involved cars have) and into their living room. Previous crashes have involved similar circumstances, according to a local member of the Indiana General Assembly, who suspects the drivers involved may have been attempting to beat the train. Tim McCall concurs, and adds,  They go airborne over the tracks because of the hill.

Katie Arrington is in critical but stable condition after two major surgeries following a car crash Friday night, authorities say—and the Republican's associates say it would take a lot more than that to halt her bid for US Congress. Her campaign says she isn't expected to have any lasting complications from the crash, Politico reports. It says the surgeries she underwent Sunday included a spinal procedure that went  very well and with no complications.  She is expected to be in the hospital for another two weeks.

Sonar equipment detected  multiple small bright reflections  2.5 miles below the surface of the Indian Ocean more than 600 miles off the coast of western Australia, AFP and ABC Australia report. Though crews believed the debris field probably wasn't an aircraft, an unmanned sub was sent to investigate what turned out to be a wreck, anchor, and apparent lumps of coal, reports the AP.  It's a fascinating find, but it's not what we're looking for,  the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's search director says.  We're not pausing in the search for MH370; in fact, the vessels have already moved on to continue the mission.  He adds the find shows  if there's a debris field in the search area, we'll find it.  Marine archaeologists, meanwhile, will examine photographs of the wreck in an effort to identify it. One archaeologist says it was likely a common, European-style cargo ship built in the second half of the 19th century, but little else has been determined.

Golge, one of more than a dozen Americans detained after a failed coup in 2016, was sentenced to more than seven years on terrorism charges in Feb. 2018, which was later reduced to five years on appeal, the New York Times reports. Golge was visiting family in southern Turkey with his family when he was detained on charges that his lawyers say were baseless. His wife and two young children have not been allowed to leave Turkey.

I remember, so clearly 25 years later, how Joel Kramer made me feel special, how he methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,  she wrote Saturday on Facebook. She says the then-36-year-old stunt coordinator got her into his hotel room by telling her parents he was going to let her swim in the hotel pool. Dushku says Kramer—who would call her  Jailbait  on set—undressed, got on top of her on the bed, and rubbed his body on her until he ejaculated. Says says he then told her,  I think we should be careful,  meaning she shouldn't tell anyone. Dushku says she did tell a few people, but  no one seemed ready to confront this taboo subject then, nor was I.  She says after one friend she told confronted Kramer—who was in charge of rigging Dushku—she had her ribs broken in a stunt  by no small coincidence.   He was supposed to be my protector, he was my abuser,  Dushku writes. She says she's coming forward now because of others in Hollywood doing so and because Kramer continues to get work on projects like Westworld and Furious 7. True Lies costar Jamie Lee Curtis tells People she didn't know about the incident, which she calls  very sad and disturbing.  Kramer tells the Wrap that Duskhu's claims are  absolute lies  that  could ruin my career.   I never sexually assaulted her,  he says.  She’s a sweet girl.

The attack began when a man in a wheelchair somehow disrupted a hive. He was stung more than 60 times and had tumbled from his wheelchair, screaming for help, when three bystanders raced to his rescue.  They probably save his life,  the Santa Ana fire chief told AP. All four men suffered rashes, nausea and vomiting, and had difficulty breathing. The street had to be evacuated as beekeepers  neutralized  the 60,000-bee hive.

"(Jun 22, 2015  8:10 AM CDT) Peder Winstrup is remarkably well-preserved for a man who died in 1679, and while researchers expected the mummified corpse of the former bishop of Lund would yield fascinating information on the 17th century, they didn't expect a CT scan to reveal another body. But when his coffin was removed from the Swedish city's cathedral, scientists were amazed to discover a tiny body, that of a fetus five to six months old, had been concealed at his feet, tucked away in a layer of herbs, the Guardian reports. DNA tests will be performed to see if the premature baby is related to the bishop, but researchers suspect that it may have been born illegitimately to a member of his household, who placed it in the coffin to ensure it had a better resting place than the unsanctified ground such babies were buried in. The director of Lund's history museum tells Radio Sweden that researchers were almost as surprised to find that the bishop, who was buried on a mattress stuffed with juniper berries and other herbs, still had his internal organs, making him a  time capsule  from 1679 and  one of the best-preserved human bodies from the 1600s,  per Lund University.  Everyone thought the bishop was embalmed, in which case, there are no internal organs left in the body,  says the museum director. But he apparently  dried out naturally,  according to the university, the result of a winter burial, constant airflow, the plants in his coffin, and his lean body, among other factors. Even the bishop's clothes are in pretty good shape, researchers say. After more tests are carried out on the two bodies, they will be reburied together, the Guardian reports.

This man was never sick,  she tells AP. Vigoda might be best known for his role as detective Phil Fish in the 1970s sitcom Barney Miller, but his big break came before that when Francis Ford Coppola cast him as Sal Tessio in the Godfather. ( Tell Mike it was only business  is one memorable line, uttered as he was being led to his death.) After Barney Miller, Vigoda went on to star in his own short-lived sitcom, Fish, and made countless appearances in films. As TMZ notes, his death has been falsely reported over and over again, dating back to 1982. But this time it's the real deal. The AP quotes the Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows on Vigoda's role in Barney Miller: ''Not only did he look incredible, he sounded and acted like every breath might be his last. Fish was always on the verge of retirement, and his worst day was when the station house toilet broke down.  Vigoda himself often recalled getting the part: He'd just finished a 5-mile jog, and the pilot's producer told him he looked like he had hemorrhoids.  What are you—a doctor or a producer?

Kate McClure started a GoFundMe for 34-year-old Johnny Bobbitt Jr. after the destitute veteran used his last 20 bucks on her when her car ran out of gas on a Philly interstate earlier this month. Her crowdfunding effort on Bobbitt's behalf has since surpassed $375,000, and the new friends appeared together on Good Morning America on Sunday to talk about everything that's happened since they first met, ABC News reports.

Federal prosecutors say Harbir Parmar picked the woman up the night of Feb. 21 to drive her from Manhattan to her home in White Plains, about an hour away. But when she fell asleep, prosecutors say, Parmar changed the destination to Boston. The woman told investigators that she woke up to find  his hand under her shirt touching the top of her breast,  the AP reports. She said she reached for her phone, but he took it and began driving again. He refused to take her to a police station and eventually left her by the side of an interstate in Connecticut. She later found her credit card had been charged $1,047 for a trip to Massachusetts. Authorities say Parmar also charged cleaning fees, falsely claiming the woman had vomited in his vehicle—something he had done with at least two other passengers. He is also accused of overcharging riders on at least 11 occasions by entering false information on their destinations. Parmar, 24, was charged Tuesday with kidnapping, which carries a potential life sentence, and wire fraud, the New York Times reports.

Verizon is seeking concessions from its two major unions in the face of declining landline revenues, thanks to the rise of cell phones and growing competition from cable companies. But even though landline revenue fell 1.2% to $20.4 billion in the first six months of 2011, the company as a whole made $3 billion in profits. Given those profits, the unions contend that the company is just trying to reduce their power.  Verizon has refused to move from a long list of concession demands,  said a union spokesman in a statement earlier today.  As the contract expired, nearly 100 concessionary company proposals remained on the table.

He enjoyed far less success after Mission: Impossible, however, finding he had been typecast, and his film career languished for more than a decade.

Steven Pressman is out to change that with a new book called 50 Children: One Ordinary American Couple’s Extraordinary Rescue Mission into the Heart of Nazi Germany, reports the Christian Science Monitor. (Pressman also made a documentary that aired on HBO.) The short version is that the Krauses lived in Philadelphia in 1939 and grew increasingly alarmed about reports of atrocities against Jews emerging from Europe. But unlike most, they decided to do something about it. They sailed overseas, entered Nazi Germany despite the danger to Jews like themselves, and managed to secure the release of 50 Jewish children whose families wanted desperately for them to make it to the US. They escorted the kids back to America—having to overcome friction in their own country over immigration worries and anti-Semitism—and put them up in a summer camp in Collegeville, Pa., notes a review of the book at the San Jose Mercury News. All were either placed in American homes or eventually reunited with their own families. The reason the story is so unknown? Afterward, the Krauses never spoke of what they did, says Pressman.

"(Apr 14, 2010  12:09 PM CDT) One of the popular talking points being thrown around is that 47% of households owe no income tax in 2009, writes David Leonhardt. It's usually followed by an argument that the wealthy pay an unfair proportion of taxes while many Americans skate free.  Neither one of those ideas is true,  writes Leonhardt in the New York Times.  They rely on a cleverly selective reading of the facts. So does the 47% number.  For starters, it refers only to federal income taxes, but people also have to worry about payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and state and local taxes, among others. In fact, data from the CBO suggest 'that, at most, about 10% of all households pay no net federal taxes.

"(Mar 16, 2020  9:10 AM CDT) There is a thief or thieves out there who definitely aren't self-quarantining amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Three  very high value  paintings were stolen just before midnight Saturday from an art gallery at Oxford University's Christ Church college. Chief among them was A Soldier On Horseback by Anthony Van Dyck, described by the BBC as a  17th-century master  who was a  leading court painter  during the reign of King Charles I. Salvator Rosa's A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying A Plan and Annibale Carracci's A Boy Drinking were also taken from the Christ Church Picture Gallery. The paintings date to about 1580 to the late 1640s. The Art Newspaper flags tweets from Old Masters dealer Philip Mould, who wrote,  Gosh. This is a serious theft at a time when we have other things to worry about. An unusual group to steal - neither priceless nor small fry.  He later added,  It’s impossible to sell these paintings anywhere on the global open market. The purpose of similar heists include: private theft to order; ransom objects (rarely effective); or collateral in underworld deals.  Police are investigating and appealing for any witnesses or people with CCTV footage of the area to come forward.

"(Jul 31, 2011  6:18 AM CDT) After weeks of posturing and pleading, with threat of a default just days away, news of a possible debt ceiling deal is dribbling out of Washington, first reported by ABC's Jonathan Karl. The deal would raise the ceiling by $2.4 trillion in two phases, enough to last into 2013, in exchange for up to $2.4 trillion in cuts—$1 trillion over the next 10 years agreed to now, with up to $1.6 trillion in deficit reduction to be named later. The final amount in cuts would match the amount the debt ceiling is raised. Congress would have until Dec. 23 to agree to the additional deficit reductions—which could include further spending cuts or tax increases. Should no deal be reached, an across-the-board cut would hit everything, including defense and Medicare, by up to 4%. Additionally, the deal would form a committee to make recommendations on cuts by late November, and schedule a vote in both the House and Senate on a balanced budget amendment.",$2.4T Debt Deal Taking Shape?
"(Mar 13, 2018  8:07 AM CDT) A study on  ubiquitous but insidious  lead exposure is being deemed a  big deal  after researchers found a link between lead exposure and the deaths of around a quarter-million Americans annually from heart disease. In what USA Today says is the first study using a nationally representative sample to look at how low-level lead exposure is tied to deaths in the US, scientists kept tabs on more than 14,000 adults who took a national health survey between 1988 and 1994, then again in 2011. After looking at how many people died during this period—about 4,400 in total, 1,800 of those from cardiovascular disease—the study in the Lancet Public Health journal found about 256,000 deaths each year could be tied to lead exposure. The effects of lead on heart health had previously been thought to be much lower, especially at low levels of lead exposure, study lead author Bruce Lanphear tells CNN. Dr. Philip Landrigan, a Mount Sinai epidemiologist not involved with the study, explains that lead—which can show up in old water pipes, paint in older homes, industrial sites, plane fuel, and even certain foods—damages blood vessels' epithelial cells, which then ups the risk of plaque building up, possibly leading to a heart attack. The scientists also looked at all kinds of deaths, not just ones caused by heart disease, and found lead was tied to more than 410,000 US deaths annually—about 10 times more than what was previously believed to be the case, and not far off from the 480,000 smokers who die each year. The good news: Today's lead-exposure levels are much lower, meaning the next generation should hopefully see a lower death rate linked to lead.

"(Feb 16, 2020  4:58 PM) More than 1,100 former Department of Justice officials have signed an online statement calling for Attorney General William Barr to resign. Barr may insist he's not working at the president's behest, but his  actions in doing the President’s personal bidding unfortunately speak louder than his words,  reads the statement, which CNN reports was signed mostly by former prosecutors with the department who have worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The constitution requires the Justice Department to be impartial, to treat all Americans equally under the law, and to prosecute free of any outside influence. DOJ lawyers  stand for the proposition that political interference in the conduct of a criminal prosecution is anathema to the Department’s core mission and to its sacred obligation to ensure equal justice under the law,  the statement reads.  And yet, President Trump and Attorney General Barr have openly and repeatedly flouted this fundamental principle, most recently in connection with the sentencing of President Trump’s close associate, Roger Stone,  the statement continues. When the department took the unheard-of step to overrule the prosecutors on the Stone case, it was clearly giving  preferential treatment  to a Trump confidant, the statement says.  Such behavior is a grave threat to the fair administration of justice,  it continues.  Governments that use the enormous power of law enforcement to punish their enemies and reward their allies are not constitutional republics; they are autocracies.

Benno, the 4-year-old Belgian Malinois, had surgery last week to remove the .308 caliber ammunition from his stomach, the Baxter Bulletin reports. Owner Larry Brassfield says Benno has eaten socks, magnets, and marbles, but he didn't expect the animal would bother a bag of bullets by his bed. Brassfield and his wife realized Benno needed medical attention after the pet vomited up four rounds.

"(Feb 5, 2015  5:45 PM) Struggling electronics retailer RadioShack has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and says it will sell up to 2,400 stores. The Fort Worth, Texas company said today that it was also having discussions to sell all of its remaining assets. RadioShack Corp. introduced one of the first mass-market personal computers and used to be the go-to stop for consumers' home electronics needs. But it struggled as shoppers increasingly shifted to making purchases online and growth in its wireless business slowed. It has suffered years of losses. The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of its shares on Monday and sought to delist it. The NYSE requires companies meet certain market capitalization thresholds to remain on the exchange. RadioShack had warned of a possible bankruptcy in September, but received rescue financing that kept it afloat. Still, its CEO recently cautioned the chain might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay in business. RadioShack worked hard on its turnaround efforts, hiring Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca as its CEO and former Treasury Department adviser Harry Wilson as chief revitalization officer. It also developed relationships with popular brands like Beats Audio and redesigned almost half of its US locations—some 2,000 stores—in an effort to entice younger shoppers. The company, which has not turned a profit since 2011, still operates nearly 5,500 stores and employs about 27,500 people worldwide, according to its last annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.",RadioShack Files for Chapter 11

After being unable to find any proof of a beverage pricier than $23.60 having been ordered, Beau Chevassus set out to order the  Quadriginoctuple Frap,  he tells the New York Daily News. The $47.30 drink is: a venti 40-shot mocha Frappuccino with soy milk, mocha drizzle, matcha powder, protein powder, caramel brulee topping, strawberry, two bananas, caramel drizzle, Frappuccino chips, and vanilla bean. Sounds ... gross. But the 27-year-old actually got the beverage on the cheap: He brought his own 52-ounce mug (purchased at Goodwill), and ordered the drink on his birthday—so it was free. And, bonus, the baristas gave him eight extra shots of espresso on the house. The Daily News notes that it's not clear if Chevassus did indeed set a record, as Starbucks didn't reply to its request for comment.

"(May 30, 2013  11:32 AM CDT) New Jersey sent nearly $24 million in taxpayer money to prisoners in the form of unemployment, welfare, pension, and other benefits, reports the New York Times. An audit released yesterday uncovered 20,000 prisoners who received benefit money between July 2009 and April 2011, including tales such as one man who collected $39,000 in unemployment benefits while locked up for a drug offense—despite a state law requiring that beneficiaries be  available for work.  State officials and  a lack of adequate internal controls  are to blame, according to the state comptroller's report.  Suffice it to say that when thousands of inmates are collecting unemployment checks from behind bars, there is a serious gap in program oversight,  the comptroller said, adding that some agency programs just didn't check to see if recipients were in state or county prison, while others relied on newspaper reports rather than available databases.  Recovering the money is not going to be a straightforward process,  he told the Star-Ledger,  but the agencies have committed to make every effort to recover it.

But unlike anyone who casually read the headline, Hickman says he thought about that little girl every day for the last 58 years, and as the Palladium-Item reports, he finally got serious about tracking her down in December. The infant was dubbed Roseann Wayne by nurses, her surname coming from Wayne County, where Hickman found her.

Had his death occurred five years earlier it likely would have gone quietly unnoticed. But in 2008, Karason went on the Today show to talk to Matt Lauer about something most unusual: his blue skin. Karason says he started turning blue a decade and a half ago, the result of applying and ingesting silver. He was trying to treat dermatitis on his face and had used what the Christian Post describes as  a silver-based remedy  along with colloidal silver. NBC News explains that the latter was something he drank, and describes it as a liquid Karason made himself that has silver particles suspended in it. He consumed 10 ounces a day, notes ABC News. It was outdated medicine, however: Though silver had been used as medicine for thousands of years, it was effectively replaced by penicillin in the 1930s, and was banned by the FDA because it causes argyria, in which silver amasses in the skin and organs and stays there. It causes the blue coloration. The Post notes that Karason was known by some children as  Papa Smurf,  but bristled when adults used the term, according to his estranged wife. In addition to his troubled marriage, Karason fought prostate cancer and health problems, and struggled financially. He noted in a 2012 interview,  People are reluctant to hire blue people.

"(Sep 27, 2017  10:50 AM CDT) Encountering a foot-and-a-half-long rat might be nightmarish for some, but for Tyrone Lavery, it heralded a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. Back in 2010, the mammalogist was exploring the Solomon Islands when he heard locals describe  vika,  a giant tree-dwelling rat with teeth powerful enough to break open coconuts. Reports of such a rat had circulated for decades. But though he searched for years, Lavery only managed to find some rather large rat poop, reports the Guardian. In 2016, however, Lavery was able to examine a rat that had died after falling from a tree downed by loggers and knew immediately his quest for  vika  was over. Uromys vika, as it has now been named, is the first new rat species discovered in the Solomon Islands in 80 years. At 18 inches long and 2.2 pounds, the specimen within the family of mosaic-tailed rats is about four times the size of a common rat. It's  pretty spectacular,  says Lavery, per a release. And though  it was just so hard to find,  the researcher is happy his persistence paid off.  If we hadn't discovered it now, it might never have gotten discovered  due to the logging of the rainforest canopy the rat inhabits through use of its scaly tail and clawed back feet, Lavery says, per National Geographic. He also describes the rat's ability to chew holes in tree nuts.

Today's quake was deeper than the 7.8-magnitude quake that rocked the country on April 25, coming from a depth of 11.5 miles versus the earlier one at 9.3 miles. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage. The Guardian explains by way of a British seismologist that in terms of the  amplitude  of the quake (meaning  the distance the ground moves ), the 7.8-magnitude quake was about five times more powerful than today's. As for today's quake, it was followed closely by at least six strong aftershocks, according to the US Geological Survey. At least four people were killed in Sindhulpalchowk's town of Chautara, according to a rep with the International Organization for Migration; that's the town where NASA managed to help find four survivors after the April 25 temblor.",2nd Big Quake Hits Nepal

"(Nov 18, 2020  8:29 AM) With a 50% drop in passengers taking to the skies in 2020, there's no better time to overhaul an industry responsible for dangerous carbon emissions, according to researchers.  If you want to resolve climate change … then we should start at the top, where a few 'super emitters' contribute massively to global warming,  Stefan Gössling of Sweden's Linnaeus University tells the Guardian.  We should see the crisis as an opportunity to slim the air transport system.  Gössling, author of a new study in Global Environmental Change, finds 1% of the global population caused half of carbon emissions linked to aviation in 2018. That's about half a billion tons of CO2, or at least 1% of annual global CO2 emissions, per CNN and the Guardian. Of rich countries, the US emitted more than the next 10 countries combined in 2018, though 53% of the population didn't fly at all. Globally, only 11% of people took a flight and just 4% flew abroad. But those frequent flyers traveled 35,000 miles a year on average, the equivalent of one short-haul flight per month, per the study. With no one covering the cost of the damage from emissions, estimated at $100 billion in 2018, this  represents a major subsidy to the most affluent,  researchers say. They suggest airlines meet environmental conditions in exchange for government bailouts. This has happened in France with Air France agreeing to limit domestic flights, per the BBC. Another possibility is a fee on frequent fliers, though Gössling thinks higher ticket prices are unlikely to deter the 1%. He suggests airlines  increase the share of [low carbon] synthetic fuels mix every year up to 100% by 2050.  A rep for the International Air Transport Association says airlines have  agreed to explore pathways to how we could move to net zero emissions by around 2060.  However, the Guardian notes aviation emissions jumped 32% from 2013 to 2018.",Here's Another Something the 1% Do

The increased rhetoric comes as hundreds of villagers denounced the American military during an angry demonstration today. Karzai said the killing of innocent Afghans  is strengthening the terrorists.  Karzai in recent weeks has increasingly lashed out at his Western backers over civilian casualties, even as US politicians and a top NATO official have criticized Karzai for the slow pace of progress.

"(Feb 21, 2017  1:48 PM) Seven months ago, Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion, the AP reports. Since then, Yahoo has revealed itself to have been the victim of the two biggest data breaches ever, resulting in information from more than a billion users being stolen. According to the Washington Post, experts expected Verizon to demand Yahoo knock billions off the purchase price or to simply call off the deal entirely. But on Tuesday, the companies announced the deal was going through—at a comparatively minor 7% discount. Verizon will now purchase Yahoo for $4.48 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. What's left of Yahoo after the sale—an entity to be known as Altaba—will split liability with Verizon for any future lawsuits that result from the Yahoo data breaches. Altaba alone will be responsible for whatever happens with an ongoing SEC investigation into the hacks. Sources say Verizon went through with the deal at a minor discount for multiple reasons. One, Verizon has a ton of money and a few billion dollars weren't going to make a difference to it. Two, Verizon says the number of Yahoo users who left following the hacks was  minimal.  Verizon is basically buying Yahoo in order to advertise to users on its news and sports sites, Tumblr, and Flickr; if a bunch of Yahoo users fled the service, Verizon would have fewer people to advertise to. Verizon, which already owns AOL and hopes to compete with Facebook and Google, wants to close the deal by the end of April.",Verizon Getting 7% Discount on Yahoo After Massive Hacks

The ex-governor and his wife spent $400,000 on clothes while in office or running for it, according to testimony from a government financial analyst at Blagojevich’s corruption trial yesterday. Prosecutors followed that up by playing a wiretap tape in which Blagojevich loudly and obscenely complained that he might not be able to afford to send his daughters to college, the Chicago Tribune reports. Prosecutors produced testimony suggesting that the Blagos paid for their sartorial excess with dubious-looking income from Patti’s real estate business. Disgraced fundraiser Antonin  Tony  Rezko was paying Patti tens of thousands of dollars to do seemingly nothing, witnesses said, suggesting that she was probably acting as a ghost payroller for him.

Hally  Bug  Yust of Spring Hill, Kan., died after contracting an infection commonly known as brain-eating amoeba, reports the Kansas City Star. The infection generally occurs in freshwater during warm weather, and Hally had been skiing on four different bodies of water in recent weeks. The exact source of the infection can't be determined as a result, but the best guess is that water went up her nose while she was skiing, and the amoeba traveled to her brain, reports KCTV5. State officials says the odds aren't quite one-in-a-billion, but the infection formally known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is relatively rare: It cites 132 cases in the US from 1962 to 2013, mostly in southern states and nearly always fatal.

However, he says he's confident the show will go on. The situation needs to be resolved quickly, because the nest was built exactly where crews need to be in order to set up the main stage.

We spent 14 months scavenging around the industry, looking at more suppliers than we ever have.  The number actually topped 30, when the fast-food company usually reviews two to five growers. The procurement took another three years, but Wendy's says it will finally have enough berries to decorate a seasonal salad coming to 6,500 North American restaurants. Will the pursuit pay off? Probably, suggests a study of 1,000. Above limiting sugar, salt, or fat, consumers say adding more produce is the most important dietary change they're making, reports the Wall Street Journal. That may partly explain the consumer shift from fast-food to fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle that prepare fresh food. Wendy's and others are hoping to compete. McDonald's is offering kale salads, Del Taco is promoting its use of fresh avocado, and Chick-fil-A is adding what it says is fresh, locally sourced produce, like red cabbage and carrots, to its chicken wrap. In Wendy's case, adding blackberries to the menu posed its  most difficult supply-chain challenge ever,  reports the Journal. As most blackberries are sold to grocery stores, Wendy's had to enlist two growers to plant extra blackberry bushes to meet the company's demand; the bushes take three years to mature.

It could happen with a sustained surge in consumer demand, but they're not seeing it yet, and time is running out. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than 940,000 people signed up during February for private coverage under President Obama's health care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million. But with open enrollment ending March 31, that means to meet the goal, another 1.8 million people would have to sign up by the end of the month, an average of about 60,000 a day. That's way above the daily averages for January and February, which have ranged between 33,000 and 34,000, and the math seems to be going against the administration. The 943,000 enrolled in February fell short of the target of 1.27 million that HHS had initially set for the month. The goal of 6 million sign-ups is itself a lower bar than was originally set.

The Telegraph reports that middle school and high school teachers there have been issued a manual to use while teaching a new subject for 2015:  Kim Jong Un's Revolutionary Activities.  The manual contains details of Kim Jong Un's childhood—specifically, the amazing story of how he was driving by age 3, per YTN TV. It also notes that Kim is an awesome artist, pens musical scores, and was acing yachting races before puberty.  At the age of 9, Kim Jong Un raced the chief executive of a foreign yacht company who was visiting North Korea at the time,  one of the passages reportedly reads (he won that race  despite the odds,  per Metro). This inherent ability to win at life apparently runs in the family: The Telegraph brings up old claims that were made about Kim's father.

"(Jul 5, 2015  6:45 PM CDT) A teenager's punishment for sleeping with an underage girl has sparked yet another effort in the movement to reform sex-offender laws, the New York Times reports. Last December, 19-year-old Zachery Anderson of Elkhart, Indiana, met a girl on the dating app Hot or Not, met her in person on Dec. 19, and had sex with her at a Michigan playground. Worried about her whereabouts, the girl's mother called police—who eventually arrested Anderson because the girl was 14, not 17 like she'd told him. Anderson pleaded guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct, was sentenced in April to 90 days in jail, and has been placed on a sex-offender registry for 25 years, reports WNDU. He'll be out on Thursday and will have to keep away from public places and allow authorities to search his home every three months. And during his 5-year probation, Anderson can't own a computer, use a smartphone, or continue his computer-related degree, the South Bend Tribune reports. WNDU noted in May he had to abandon his major and would probably lose his scholarship. Anderson's parents, the girl, and her mother all appealed for leniency, and Michigan has a law (the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act) that actually allows first-time offenders between ages 17 and 21 to receive a lighter sentence. But instead the judge lectured Anderson about online hookups:  Meet, hook up, have sex, sayonara,  he said.  Totally inappropriate behavior.  The head of an advocacy group aiming to reform sex-offender laws says Anderson's case (she terms it a conviction  on steroids ) is common, and often ruins people's careers. But changing laws is difficult, Brenda V. Jones says, because lawmakers are nervous about being  soft on sex offenders.  Meanwhile, Anderson's family is trying to find him a new home to accommodate sex-offender laws while their lawyer tries to withdraw Anderson's guilty plea; an Aug. 5 hearing is planned.

Per the Department of Labor, the median annual wage for  refuse and recyclable materials collectors  is $33,600, with those in the top 10% pulling in $58,590. And if you're in a high-paying state, those wages are even more: In New York, for example, the annual mean wage is $52,570, or just over $25 per hour. To be sure, Molina and Sanka earn that paycheck: They work 55 to 60 hours a week from 7pm to 3am, do lots of heavy lifting in unsafe environments and all sorts of weather, and deal with stuff no one else would want to (that human body part: a leg Sankar spotted in a dumpster). And some people feel there's still a stigma attached to handling trash.

Some 7,185 people from all over the city were taken to the site after being arrested, according to documents disclosed under the Guardian transparency lawsuit—and that number doesn't include people who were questioned there but not charged. Fewer than 1% of the detainees had access to lawyers while at Homan Square, the records show, and a disproportionate number of those were white. Most of the arrestees taken to Homan Square were eventually charged with drug offenses, according to police records. Former detainees have described multiple abuses, including physical and sexual assault.  Not much shakes me in this business,  a lawyer whose client was questioned at Homan Square after a marijuana bust tells the Guardian.  That place was and is scary. It's a scary place. There's nothing about it that resembles a police station. It comes from a Bond movie or something.

"(Nov 2, 2011  8:36 AM CDT) Is Occupy Wall Street inadvertently hurting the little guy? That’s what Marc Epstein, owner of Wall Street’s Milk Street Cafe, claims. Thanks to the protests—and the resulting police barricades that line Wall Street, which he says somewhat hide his eatery and make it difficult for people to enter—sales are down 30%. So Epstein had to fire 21 of his employees last week, he tells DNAinfo.  What are [the protesters] trying to accomplish here?  Epstein says.  The end result is that I and all the wonderful people who work for me are collateral damage.  While Epstein supports the protesters' rights, he isn’t a huge fan of the barred subway entrances, constant marches, and police checkpoints, all contributing factors to his decision to now close at 3:30pm instead of 9pm on weekdays. This after he sank $4 million into the location, opened in June and was heralded as a part of the neighborhood's revitalization. Things were going so well Epstein thought he'd hit break-even by this month. Now he estimates he may only be able to stay in business three more weeks.  This movement is not serious,  he concludes.

"(Aug 12, 2011  11:58 AM CDT) The 12 members of the new budget super committee have received more than $3 million over the past five years from special interests directly affected by potential cuts, an AP review finds. The money came from groups linked to defense contractors, labor unions, and health care providers, and buffered the lawmakers’ re-election campaigns. With Medicare and defense spending on the chopping block, the health care industry has donated $1 million to super committee members, while defense firms have handed them $700,000. The bipartisan co-chairs of the panel, Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, have both benefited from the support of lobbyists and political groups.  With the public already disgusted with Washington in the wake of the debt limit debacle, it's vital that people have confidence that super committee members are thinking about the nation's best interests, not positioning their party or worrying about how their decisions appear to donors,  says the head of an advocacy group.

Officials of the New Zealand university hosting the Boston visitors said they strongly discourage such students from driving because of their unfamiliarity with driving along the left side of the road; the school intends to strengthen those warnings in the future.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday by New York artist Jason Koza, who claims his drawings of Wu-Tang members were used as album artwork for Once Upon a Time in Shaolin without his permission. According to NBC News, Koza blames Shkreli for  permitting at least three of the nine Wu-Tang Clan portraits to be displayed to the public in a news article,  referring to a story in Vice. Koza is also suing the Wu-Tang's RZA, an auction house, and a Wu-Tang producer.

Meanwhile, Skhreli is also in the midst of an escalating battle with the Wu-Tang's Ghostface Killah, CNBC reports.

The country is believed to be producing 330 pounds of highly enriched uranium per year at one or two sites—enough for six nuclear bombs—and likely has 70 to 120 pounds of plutonium, a Johns Hopkins University report published Monday reads, per Reuters. Experts add that North Korea's uranium enrichment program has been around since at least 2003 and will likely carry on with little interruption from sanctions.

"(Jan 19, 2016  10:00 AM) You thought Asian camel crickets were bad. A new report in journal Peer J finds hundreds of bugs likely lurk in your home, including spiders, beetles, ants, and book lice. Scientists got down on their hands and knees and combed 50 houses in the suburbs of Raleigh, NC, picking up any bugs they found, to determine the diversity of arthropods indoors. They  found far more diversity than most people would expect,  study leader Matt Bertone tells National Geographic. More specifically, they gathered 10,000 bugs from 579 species. If that doesn't freak you out, this probably will: Each home housed 100 species on average, per New Scientist, though one revealed 211 species. And less than 1% of rooms were bug-free.  That old wives' tale that you're never more than 10 feet away from a spider? If you're in your home, that might be true,  Bertone says. Every home contained ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders, and gall midges, which  rely on things we produce or have in our homes,  says Bertone. About 98% held book lice, which eat mold and mildew, reports Wired. There were even some bugs scientists suspect might be new species. Since scientists searched carpets, floorboards, and shelves, but not behind walls, under heavy furniture, or in cabinets, they say more bugs are probably hiding nearby. On the plus side, most were harmless.  The residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much,  says Bertone. But except for the occasional cockroaches, termites, and fleas, the bugs are  not dangerous and you won't see them unless you really look for them.

Most of the violations—74 of them—occurred at one China facility. The kids were ordered home, and Apple cut ties with the plant, which makes components for circuit boards. In all, 11 factories had at least one worker under age 16, often because their families worked with recruiters to forge IDs. While Apple has had high-profile problems at its Foxconn production plant in China, the facilities involved in this report are mostly lower-level parts suppliers.  We go deep in the supply chain to find it,  an Apple VP tells Business Insider.  And when we do find it, we ensure that the underage workers are taken care of, the suppliers are dealt with.  Foxconn has previously acknowledged hiring underage interns, and Apple says a main focus now is making sure that plants don't abuse the concept of internships.",Apple Finds 106 Underage Workers in Factories
"(Feb 23, 2009  3:47 AM) Sumatran tigers have killed six Indonesians in the last month, including three over the weekend. The latest victims include a father-son pair of illegal loggers who were attacked while they slept in a protected forest, AP reports. Sumatrans are the world's most endangered tiger subspecies. Poaching and forest destruction have left only 250 of them in the wild. About 40 people were killed by the tigers between 2000 and 2004. Villagers often fall victim to hungry cats that stray into their communities. A tigress that killed three people near a village last month was captured and relocated. In the latest attack, the tigers were in their natural habitat.  This time it was the loggers' fault,  said a conservationist.",Sumatran Tigers Kill 3 in Indonesia
"(Oct 19, 2009  5:46 AM CDT) Disastrous climate change is inevitable unless the world begins cutting carbon emissions within the next five years, the World Wildlife Fund warns in a new report. Ahead of December's clutch Copenhagen summit, meant to forge a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, the fund repeats that global temperature rises could stay below 2°C if greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2050. But to do that, the world must invest in a  green industrial revolution,  focused on low-carbon fuels like wind and solar, between now and 2014. Today officials from the world's leading powers are meeting in London for the Major Economies Forum, reports the Telegraph, which President Obama called for to work out snags ahead of Copenhagen. The Europeans are pressuring the US, China, and India to agree to legally binding carbon emissions targets, with Gordon Brown telling delegates that only 50 days remained to save the world from  catastrophe.","5 Years Until Climate Disaster, Warns WWF"

"(Mar 7, 2013  10:47 AM) More than 500 years after Spain expelled or forcibly converted its once thriving Jewish population, the country has announced plans to allow descendents of those Sephardic Jews a fast-track to Spanish passports and citizenship, reports the BBC. In the 15th century, there were around 300,000 Jews in Spain, but in 1492 they were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Many of those who left went to North Africa or the Ottoman Empire; indeed, even today 90% of the 100,000 Jews in Turkey are descendents of Sephardic Jews. However, the conversos, those who converted to Christianity and stayed in Spain, were targeted heavily by the Inquisition.  In the long journey Spain has undertaken to rediscover a part of itself, few occasions are as moving as today,  said Spain's justice minister when he made his announcement in November. In the first month alone, there were 6,000 inquiries about regaining citizenship. However, the details of the new policy are still being worked out, and some have complained that the policy of return only applies to still practicing Jews, not to secular Jews or Christian converts. And Muslim groups have pointed out they were kicked out of Spain at the same time, but no one is inviting them back.","500 Years Later, Spain Invites Jews Back"
"(Apr 3, 2008  11:39 AM CDT) In a move to make drivers of gas-guzzlers  pay for the environmental damage they cause,  London’s mayor is imposing a CO2 charge: beginning in October, every private vehicle driven in the central city that doesn’t meet tough emissions standards will cost its owners $50 a day, the Los Angeles Times reports. The new charge comes on top of the existing $16 congestion charge. Under the new plan, congestion pricing, which has cut the number of cars in the area by 70,000 and pushed mass transit ridership up 36%, would be suspended for the most fuel efficient cars. Not surprisingly, the aggressive campaign against guzzlers, which Mayor Ken Livingstone likes to call  Chelsea tractors,   has sparked a backlash, with some Londoners vowing to unseat him in May’s election.

"(Dec 6, 2011  1:10 AM) Yosemite park rangers believe a grim find in the Merced River will allow them to close the books on one of the park's worst tragedies. A body discovered in the river is believed to be that of 21-year-old Ramina Badal, the third of three young hikers swept over a 317-foot waterfall last summer, AP reports. Another body found trapped under house-sized boulders last week has been identified as one of the victims. The bodies were likely found because the river is at its lowest level of the year. The first body was found in August, just weeks after the tragedy. The trio—members of central California's close-knit Assyrian Christian community—had stepped over a guardrail to pose for a photo. Badal slipped on the wet granite, and her two male companions fell as they tried to save her. Dozens of witnesses looked on helplessly as they were swept over the edge.

"(Apr 19, 2012  12:30 PM CDT) Good news for those of you not quite making $75,000 per year: A new study finds that an annual income of just $50,000 is enough to inspire happiness. A previous study put the magic happiness number at $75,000, finding that even Americans making significantly more than that weren't any happier. The new study isn't quite the same: It didn't measure what happens to happiness after the $50,000 mark, it just found that those making less than $50,000 weren't as satisfied with their lives. The new poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found that those making at least $50,000 per year were more satisfied in every area surveyed, including housing, relationships, neighborhood safety, health, employment, spirituality, community involvement, retirement prospects, finances, and general life direction. Respondents who made less than that were more likely to consider their best days behind them, and were less likely to refer to themselves as very happy, Time reports.","Actually, You Only Need $50K Per Year to Be Happy"

On April 9, two male St. Anthony's High School students brought the flag to a handball game. Both teams were from St. Anthony's, but one was mostly white, and the other mostly black, according to WABC. The flag was quickly confiscated and the boys suspended.  Everybody was kind of like, 'Are you serious, did this actually just happen?'  one senior says. With tensions running high, Brother Gary Cregan, the principal of the South Huntington school, asked students not to make things worse on social media, the New York Daily News reports. But soon thereafter one girl posted a picture of herself in blackface, and another posted a racially inflammatory comment. They too were initially suspended, but now Cregan has ousted them all permanently.  It's that serious and it's that obnoxious,  he says.

"(Apr 21, 2016  1:52 AM CDT) Chyna, the WWE star who became one of the best-known and most popular female professional wrestlers in history, has died at age 45. Police in Southern California say they were responding to a 911 call from a friend of the former wrestler when they found her dead in her Redondo Beach apartment. A friend had gone Wednesday to check on Chyna, whose real name is Joan Marie Laurer, after she had failed to answer her phone for a few days, Redondo Beach police said in a statement. The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasn't breathing. Neither police nor coroner's officials have released any cause of death, the AP reports. The tall, muscle-bound, raven-haired Chyna billed herself as the  Ninth Wonder of the World  because her wrestling predecessor Andre the Giant had already called himself the eighth. Rising to prominence in the late 1990s, she was a member of the wrestling squad that dubbed itself  D-Generation X,  often wrestled against men, and at one point was the WWE women's champion. After leaving the WWE in 2001, Chyna posed for Playboy and appeared in adult films and on reality TV, including the shows The Surreal Life and Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.

"(May 31, 2014  5:31 AM CDT) The soap opera that is Donald Sterling's ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers seems to be winding down, but not without a few last-minute plot twists. To begin with, Steve Ballmer's $2 billion purchase of the team is now all but a done deal and expected to close next month, the LA Times reports. But that momentum didn't stop Sterling from suing the NBA for $1 billion in damages, alleging that the league illegally wrenched the team from him, reports the Wall Street Journal. Not so, says the league, because wife Shelly had every right to strike a deal with Ballmer on her own once her husband was deemed mentally unfit. The kicker there is that Shelly Sterling, as part of her to deal to sell the team, indemnified the league against any lawsuits from her husband. Which is to say, she would have to pay that $1 billion in damages herself if by some long shot he wins in court, reports AP. The league, for its part, is brushing of the lawsuit as  entirely baseless.  And the final footnote belongs to the Upshot blog of the New York Times, which crunches the numbers to reveal that Donald Sterling would make a return on his investment of 15,900% under the Ballmer deal. Sterling bought the club for $12.5 million in 1981.",Sterling Sues NBA for $1B

The gig: taking over the East Brother Light Station, a late-1800s lighthouse-turned-B&B on a small island on the northern edge of San Francisco Bay. The two current caretakers, Che Rodgers and Jillian Meeker, are leaving their posts and need two others to take over—but those two others will need to be willing and able to perform a plethora of upkeep tasks to earn what's estimated to be a $130,000 salary, including cooking, cleaning, laundry, setting up supply runs, and ferrying patrons to and from the mainland, per the Guardian.

The payout needs approval from the city's spending panel and that OK is expected to come tomorrow. Once granted, the money would be doled out over a two-year period. A statement from Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's office says that the settlement  should not be interpreted as a judgment on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial.  Rather, the city's decision to accept civil liability in the case was done to avoid the cost of a court battle that could have ultimately cost taxpayers much more. The Sun reports on the magnitude of the settlement: Since 2011, the city has only paid out sums in excess of $200,000 six times; there were a total of 120 claims made in that period related to alleged police brutality, and the Grays' settlement is just slightly larger than all of those combined.",Freddie Gray's Family to Get $6.4M From Baltimore

If Ibrahim al-Asiri—who was believed to have been involved in an unsuccessful 2009 plot to blow up an aircraft over Detroit on Christmas Day with an underwear bomb—is dead, it would  represent a serious blow to operational capability  for al-Qaeda, the UN says. The report does not detail how al-Asiri may have died. Government officials in the US are now looking into evidence that the Saudi-born terrorist is, in fact, dead, CNN reports. But some analysts say that reports of al-Asiri's death should be received with skepticism because al-Qaeda has yet to acknowledge it. One former British spy tells CNN that  it would be extremely out of the ordinary  for al-Qaeda not to release a eulogy for such a senior leader. In addition to the Christmas Day plot that failed due to a malfunction, al-Asiri, born in 1982, is believed to have built a bomb used in a 2009 attempt to assassinate a Saudi official (the bomber, al-Asiri's brother, was killed in the attempt), according to a 2014 BBC profile.

There's no expiration date,  says Bratton, who envisions a program in which people with outstanding warrants would be notified that their risk of arrest could disappear if they come forward.  It would be great to get rid of that backlog. It's not to our benefit from a policing standpoint to have all those warrants floating around out there.  Mayor Bill de Blasio's criminal justice coordinator says officials are investigating  how to safely reduce the number of already outstanding warrants.  Officials are redesigning the summons form itself, texting reminders to people ahead of their court dates, as well as cutting down court processing times to shrink the number of people who end up in jail for low-level offenses. They'll post summons data broken down by race for analysis, a concession to advocates who claim tickets disproportionately target minorities. One expert says many of the nearly 40% who failed to show for court last year are people who are homeless or mentally ill and don't have money to pay fines.  We want people to be held accountable to the court system, but sometimes to make things work better we have to find reasonable fixes,  she says.",How to Clear NYC's 1.2M Warrant Backlog: Amnesty

The man was carrying  several firearms,  when he attacked the family in Campinas, about 60 miles from Sao Paulo, according to Cpl. Marta Aurelia. Thirteen people were killed, including the man's ex-wife, the couple's 8-year-old boy, and other family members. Aurelia wasn't sure if that total included the gunman. Another three people were wounded. At least one of those wounded escaped by running to a neighbor's house, the AP reports.

Those two tied for the worst celebrity baby boy names of 2011 on a new BabyNames.com poll, ABC News reports. The worst baby girl name  award  went to Zuzu Audrey Peterson, daughter of a former Top Chef Just Desserts contestant. Poll respondents also didn't like the name Mirabella Bunny, daughter to Bryan Adams, or Kevin James' choice for his son, Kannon. But not all the names this year were terrible: Ne-Yo's son, Mason Evan Smith, was honored for having the best boy's name, while Pink's daughter, Willow Sage Hart, won on the girls' side.

"(Feb 17, 2010  10:48 AM) Haiti’s earthquake caused up to $14 billion in damages, or 117% of Haiti’s annual economic output, according to a new study from the Inter-American Development Bank. That makes it the most costly natural disaster since World War II, relative to the size and economy of the affected country. The figure is a preliminary one—an official estimate hits in a few weeks—but a veteran of the Hurricane Mitch rebuilding effort says it's probably  relatively conservative.  Rebuilding after Hurricane Mitch cost $6.3 billion, and that disaster killed only about 10,000 people. The Haiti quake killed roughly 250,000, a staggering per-capita loss of 25,000 out of every million Haitians; for comparison, 772 of every million Indonesians died in the 2004 tsunami.

Raul Rodriguez shot dead his neighbor, a 36-year-old teacher, after going next door to complain about noise from a party—carrying a gun, a video camera, and a cell phone. He used a flashlight to lure partygoers out into the street, and then filmed himself confronting them, calling police and saying he felt his life was in danger, adding:  I'm standing my ground here.  Rodriguez killed his unarmed neighbor and wounded two other men after a partygoer apparently made a grab for the camera.

But in order to understand the crime, you need to know the victim: the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The Times describes it as a  cartel  that controls the bulk of the world's maple syrup supply;  it's like OPEC,  says its acting head. To keep prices high, it stockpiles syrup produced in excess of the strict quota it sets for its members; in a bad year, it'll dip into the reserve (which now stands at 46 million pounds) to keep the supply consistent. The problem arose in 2011, after a bumper year forced the federation to rent out an additional warehouse, where it stored 16,000 drums of 54 gallons each. The thieves rented out space in the same warehouse, allowing them to access the facility without raising suspicions. Then they slowly began emptying the syrup barrels, in some cases refilling the drums with water. Their final take: 6 million pounds. And unlike the predicament faced by many criminals, the Times explains they were able to unload it at full price, by presenting themselves as legitimate syrup dealers in neighboring New Brunswick and selling it throughout the region and to the US.

"(Nov 18, 2016  12:29 PM) Cobb County, Ga., just told the residents of a neighborhood next to the new Atlanta Braves stadium to say goodbye to their homes. The county is using eminent domain to take over at least 16 Turnberry Lane homes, and likely 15 more, and bulldoze them in order to make room for a new four-lane road that will increase access to SunTrust Park, currently under construction. As 11Alive reports, the county has ensured homeowners they will be given fair market value for their homes—but they likely won't be given the amount they could have received for their home had it stayed put and, ultimately, been within walking distance of the new ballpark. Deadspin has more on the contentious background of the new ballpark, including the public paying for it but having no say in the negotiations and the politician behind it getting voted out of office. Sean Breslin, who has championed the new stadium on his blog, is one of the homeowners who will lose his home within months.  So my wife and I will leave our home soon—the only home we’ve ever known, the place where we’ve lived since the summer of 2013, a year before we got married,  he writes.  We’ll find another home, probably in Cobb County, but likely a lot farther up I-75. We’ll pay the same taxes we do now, but we won’t quite feel the changes in the area we’ve anticipated since the Braves made their big announcement.  He doesn't blame the Braves, since the county claims the four-lane road has been a consideration for two decades and is simply of more importance now.

"(Aug 10, 2019  9:00 AM CDT) After four rounds of reported missile launches over the last two weeks, North Korea has apparently added a fifth. Per the AP, South Korea's military says that on Saturday, the North fired from its east coast what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The projectiles flew about 250 miles, with an apogee of 30 miles, per South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seoul's Blue House says the new tests were likely meant to be another sign of Kim Jong Un's displeasure with joint military drills that the US and South Korea are holding, as well as a test of how reliable the weapons are. The New York Times notes this latest launch comes just a day after President Trump told reporters at the White House he'd received a  beautiful  three-page letter from Kim on Thursday that was  very positive.  On Twitter Saturday morning, Trump expanded on the letter reportedly sent by Kim.  He stated, very nicely, that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over,  Trump posted.  It was a long letter, much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises. It was also a small apology for testing the short range missiles, and that this testing would stop when the exercises end.  He added that he hoped to meet again with Kim in  the not so distant future  and said  a nuclear free North Korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world!",N.

"(Sep 6, 2011  2:27 PM CDT) The roads are full of people who aren’t legally allowed to drive—in large part because lots of people ignore license suspensions. Roughly one in 10 American motorists doesn’t have a valid license, experts tell the St. Petersburg Times, and though some never had them, most lost them due to either on-road mishaps or financial hardship. In many places, unpaid parking tickets or child support can trigger license suspensions, as can missed court dates. According to AAA estimates, two-thirds of people with suspended licenses drive anyway. If they’re caught it  almost always destroys their chances of pulling themselves out of a hole,  says one assistant Florida state attorney, as costs of tickets, court dates, and more pile up.

The German diocese claims the bells were loaned out to parishes across former West Germany after World War II as the British military blocked the return of the bells to eastern territories.

But how Northup died remains a mystery that historians are still trying to solve, the AP reports. To recap, Northup was living with his family in upstate New York when two white men lured him to Washington, DC, in 1841, kidnapped him, and sold him into slavery in New Orleans. He survived 12 years on a Louisiana cotton plantation before friends sprung him, and he went on to publish a memoir and help escaped slaves attain freedom via the Underground Railroad. But around 1863, he vanished. Was he killed as a Union Army spy? Did he hit the bottle and get kidnapped again? Or did he just die someplace where a black man wouldn't get a proper burial during the Civil War? Historians have heard or surmised such versions of Northup's death, and one author, David Fiske, checked cemeteries and death records but came up empty.  He may have just wandered around from place to place and died somewhere nobody knew who he was, and he was buried in a potter's field,  said Fiske.

But Mitoshi Matsumoto says the company is trying to change that description to Japan's best-known former 7-Eleven franchisee. The convenience store owner and the company have been engaged in a battle over its round-the-clock demands: Last month, Matsumoto said he would close the store—open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, per company policy—for New Year's Day only, so that he and his two full-time workers could break from their normal schedule of 14-hour shifts. He'd already irked the company in February by deciding to trim his store hours and close between 1am and 6am daily. 7-Eleven threatened to close the store then but backed off after he attracted media attention. Matsumoto says retaliation took the form of a letter sent to him 10 days ago that said 7-Eleven had logged 78 complaints in 2019 about his store, and that the location would be closed if he didn't rectify the situation by year-end. The Japan Times reports negotiations failed on Sunday and 7-Eleven canceled his contract, but that Matsumoto still plans to close Wednesday and reopen Thursday—though his cash register won't work and he won't be able to restock inventory.

"(Oct 2, 2011  1:17 PM CDT) A government warplane mistakenly bombed an army position in southern Yemen, killing at least 30 soldiers and wounding many more, military and medical officials said today. The officials said the bombing, which took place last evening in the southern Abyan province, targeted an abandoned school used as shelter by soldiers of the army's 119th Brigade.

The airstrike may raise questions about whether the bombing was a mistake since the troops that were hit had sided against President Ali Abudullah Saleh in the country's political crisis.","Yemeni Jet Mistakenly Bombs Army, Kills 30"

"(Jan 19, 2009  9:01 AM) An Australian writer has been sentenced to 3 years in prison for insulting Thailand’s monarchy in one passage of a self-published book, the BBC reports. Tough  lese-majeste  laws shield Thailand’s monarchy from criticism and led to Harry Nicolaides’ arrest as he was leaving the country. He pleaded guilty to the insult charge, saying he hadn’t known it was illegal. Only seven copies of the volume sold, one of which is on display in the Thai National Library. A short passage mentions a crown prince, who isn’t named.  Truth is stranger than fiction,  Nicolaides said.  This has to be a bad dream.

"(Feb 5, 2016  9:40 AM) Pope Francis and the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church will meet in Cuba next week in a historic step to heal the 1,000-year-old schism that divided Christianity between East and West, both churches announced Friday. The Feb. 12 meeting between Francis and Patriarch Kirill will be the first ever between the leaders of the Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, which is the largest in Orthodoxy. Francis is due to travel to Mexico Feb. 12-18. He will stop in Cuba on the way and meet with Kirill at the Havana airport, where they will speak privately for about two hours and then sign a joint declaration, the Vatican said.  This event has extraordinary importance in the path of ecumenical relations and dialogue among Christian confessions,  said the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. The two churches split during the Great Schism of 1054 and have remained estranged over a host of issues, including the primacy of the pope and Russian Orthodox accusations that the Catholic Church is poaching converts in former Soviet lands. Those tensions have prevented previous popes from ever meeting with the Russian patriarch, even though the Vatican has long insisted that it was merely ministering to tiny Catholic communities in largely Orthodox lands. The persecution of Christians—Catholic and Orthodox—in the Middle East and Africa, however, has had the effect of bringing the two churches closer together. Both the Vatican and the Orthodox Church have been outspoken in denouncing attacks on Christians and the destruction of Christian monuments, particularly in Syria.",Pope Plans to End 1K-Year-Old Russian Rift

The Nevada Department of Wildlife is on the hunt for  Bubba,  a gigantic, nearly legendary black bear who has broken into at least 50 homes and caused $70,000 in property damage, the Wall Street Journal reports. His MO is consistent: He always breaks in by punching through the garage door, and tends to leave basketball-sized dumps inside as a calling card. Forced down from the mountains by harsh recent winters, Bubba is twice the size of a normal black bear, and he’s proven exceedingly elusive. One homeowner claims to have shot him, only to see the bullet bounce off his enormous skull, injuring, but not killing him. The Wildlife Department has begun a concerted hunt, with one official patrolling nightly, armed with a fire extinguisher, pepper spray, and two dogs that can only be commanded in Russian.

"(Apr 4, 2016  12:37 AM CDT) Edwin Shifrin, 93, seldom discussed his time at war and his memory is fading, but the Missouri man received a prisoner-of-war medal in February after son Dan Shifrin dug through old news reports and his father's military records and pieced together what happened. Assigned to the Army's 30th Infantry Division, 1st Battalion, 117th Infantry Regiment, Company C, Shifrin landed on France's Normandy beach in June 1944, a week after the D-Day invasion, and then fought the Germans in battles at St. Lo and Mortain. The Germans captured Shifrin on Aug. 7 and he ended up in the Stalag III-C prison camp, about 90 miles east of Berlin. Telegrams to US family members notified them he was missing in action. Shifrin was on the camp's  escape committee,  which devised a plan for prisoners to hide during roll call, causing a futile search for escapees. That allowed the prisoners to slip away unnoticed days later, when the head count had been lowered. Shifrin made his getaway with other prisoners in mid-January 1945, just weeks before the Russians liberated the camp. Dan Shifrin tells the AP that  the rest of their journey is pretty hazy,  but what's known is they hitchhiked on Allied supply trucks and purloined rides on horses and bikes on their way to Italy. By that April, Shifrin was back on US soil. After getting his law degree, he became a St. Louis attorney and worked well into his 80s.  We knew he'd been in the war, that he had been captured, and that he escaped. That's about it. He didn't talk about it,  his son says.

The cause was congestive heart failure, notes ABC News. In addition to her famous campaign against drugs, the one-time actress promoted several causes while she was in the White House and even in the years after. She was a passionate advocate for lifting restrictions on stem cell research and promoting better treatment of America's veterans. But above all, Nancy Reagan was a fiercely devoted wife.  My life began with Ronnie,  she told Vanity Fair magazine in 1998. The first lady's public life had its share of controversy but also earned the respect of the nation, making Nancy Reagan one of America's most admired women in the 1980s and beyond. Anne Frances  Nancy  Robbins was born on July 6, 1921 in New York City to Kenneth Robbins, a car salesman, and Edith Luckett Robbins, an actress. She met Ronald Reagan in 1950, when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild and she was seeking help with a problem: Her name had been wrongly included on a published list of suspected communist sympathizers. They discussed it over dinner, and she later wrote that she realized on that first blind date  he was everything that I wanted.  They wed two years later, on March 4, 1952.

Just weeks ago, the governor signed an online sales tax provision aimed at raising $60 million over five years. Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform slapped the move with a  new tax  label. And Perry voted for more than 12 tax increases during his six-year stint in the Texas House.

Authorities say Morabito's use of his real name triggered a six-month investigation that ended with his arrest at a hotel in Uruguay, the Guardian reports. Morabito had apparently been living in the Punta del Este resort area since slipping into the country in 2002 using a fake Brazilian passport with the name Francisco Capeletto.

"(Dec 25, 2020  8:07 AM) Volleyball Magazine's April 2015 cover featured the No. 1 college volleyball recruit in America: Hayley Hodson. A lengthy December 2020 Los Angeles Times article about the player has a less positive flavor. The Californian, now 24, played for Stanford as a freshman and alleges that two blows to the head she suffered there weren't properly treated—and ended up ending her career and ruining her health. As Patrick Hruby reports, Stanford was just one part of Hodson's plan, which involved playing in the 2020 Olympic Games and then having a pro career abroad. Then came that first hit, on Nov. 9, 2015. Team coach John Dunning ran Hodson and her teammate through the  courage  drill, in which a coach on a stool spikes the ball toward the players, who need to  dig,  meaning dive to keep it from hitting the floor. Hruby cites a 2012 YouTube video that shows Dunning running the drill.  You need to be careful,  he says at the start.  If I were you and going to do this—well, I don’t know if I would do it at all.  Hodson did do it, and suffered a blow to her right head strong enough that it impacted her vision. A team doctor diagnosed her the next day with a  mild concussion,  and vision issues and brain fog persisted. On Nov. 27, she took a ball to the forehead while playing UCLA. Hruby cites studies and the CDC in reporting it's been shown athletes who experience a second concussion while not healed from the prior one have an increased risk of  prolonged or permanent symptoms.  That's been the case for Hodson, who says that UCLA game was the last time she played well; insomnia, migraines, dizziness, and blurry vision followed. By early 2017, a clinical neuropsychologist determined parts of her brain were operating at 10%. She medically retired.

Asked if he was qualified to hold the Oval Office, Biden responded:  I would not have run for president in the first place and the president wouldn't have picked me if he didn't think I could do the job.

"(Apr 20, 2012  4:22 AM CDT) The people of an indigenous town in western Mexico kidnapped 16 police officers in a desperate attempt to get some attention from the state government, AP reports. Illegal loggers linked to drug cartels have been destroying the forests the people of Cheran depend on. The town of 17,000 people set up roadblocks last year to thwart loggers, but earlier this week, eight townspeople investigating reports of illegal logging were ambushed and killed by gunmen. When the 16 police officers arrived in town after the massacre, townspeople—who accuse local cops of being in cahoots with the La Familia cartel—locked them in an office and contacted state authorities to demand a full investigation and an increase in patrols by state police and soldiers in the town's surrounding areas.

"(Aug 17, 2011  2:33 AM CDT) The Vatican is marking World Youth Day celebrations in Madrid by offering women who have had abortions an easy way to become Catholics again, reports the Guardian. Abortion is punishable by instant excommunication and  normally, only certain priests have the power to lift such an excommunication, but the local diocese has decided to give all the priests taking confession at the event this power,  explains a spokesman for Pope Benedict XVI. Some 200 confession booths have been set up in central Madrid for the 6-day event, which is expected to attract well over a million pilgrims as well as plenty of protesters. The Spanish government will be covering some of the costs of the $72 million event, which will include a visit from the pontiff tomorrow.

The nearly two-fold increase comes amid two developments (purely coincidence, says the company): First, Apple's new iPhone is expected out in June, and that could mean millions of new subscribers for AT&T, which has an exclusivity contract. Second, Apple is expected to scrap that exclusive contract at the end of the year, meaning that iPhone users who are tired of AT&T's network jams and want to switch to a different service can pay through the nose for the privilege. The fee increase, which also covers netbooks, won't affect existing contracts. It's a  fair approach,  says a company spokesman.",AT&T Raises Smartphone Termination Fee to $325
"(Aug 19, 2015  2:00 AM CDT) Too drunk to fly, and possibly too drunk to walk: A co-pilot who went on a drinking binge with three other airBaltic crew members hours before a flight was found to have a blood alcohol level around seven times the legal limit, the BBC reports. The 38-year-old told a court in Norway that he and his colleagues  lost control  after going out drinking in the afternoon and were still boozing at 2am, four hours before departure time, although they did switch from whiskey to beer at some point. The crew was breathalyzed after an anonymous tip before their Aug. 8 flight from Oslo to the Greek island of Crete, and authorities found that the pilot, co-pilot, and two out of three flight attendants were over the legal limit. The co-pilot was sentenced to six months in prison yesterday, while one flight attendant got 45 days and the other 60 days. The 50-year-old pilot—who faces more serious charges because he was responsible for the crew, as well as around 100 passengers—has had his trial postponed until next month and will remain in custody until then, reports NewsinEnglish.no. He was found to have a blood alcohol level around twice the legal limit, the BBC notes.

The spree reportedly began when Syed shot and killed a woman in her 20s inside her home, though police haven't said yet whether there was any relationship between the pair. (A neighbor said a man and three children were later escorted from the house.) Syed then killed two commuters in separate carjackings before killing himself as police closed in on him at an intersection, reports the Los Angeles Times. Two other people were wounded, and drivers on local freeways reported being shot at during the spree. One of the carjacking deaths is especially chilling. Police say Syed apparently ran out of gas in the first car he stole, then commandeered a BMW stopped at a red light. He forced the driver out of the car, made him walk to the curb, and shot him.  He was basically executed,  says Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna.  There were at least six witnesses.","California Freeway Shooter ID'd as Student, 20"

"(Jul 17, 2017  12:03 AM CDT) His movies were groundbreaking—and that ground was over a grave. George Romero, the director known as the  Father of the Zombie Film  for 1968's Night of the Living Dead and its follow-ups, died of lung cancer on Sunday, CNN reports. He was 77. Romero, who grew up in the Bronx, used money from directing commercials to make Night of the Living Dead, which, per the BBC, was the  first film to depict cannibalistic reanimated corpses.  It made $30 million on a budget of $114,000 and spawned five sequels, including 1978's mall-set Dawn of the Dead, which is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies of all time. Romero also directed non-zombie horror movies, including 1982's Creepshow. Romero spent most of his life in Pittsburgh, which now hosts an annual Zombie Fest and is sometimes called the  Zombie Capital of the World,  the Hollywood Reporter notes. The director, who mixed social commentary with the gore, most recently returned to the zombie genre with the Empire of the Dead graphic novel.  I used to be the only guy in the playground, I was the only guy doing zombies,  he said in a recent Timeline documentary.  Then all of a sudden The Walking Dead happened and it became mainstream.

"(Jul 7, 2016  1:57 PM CDT) A joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Times presents a troubling look at how  unknown tens of thousands  of Americans have their lives ruined by false drug arrests. The problem stems from a $2 drug-test kit used by police departments around the country. They've been around for more than 40 years and haven't changed much in their simplicity: A police officer drops a suspected sample of a drug into a vial of liquid, and if the liquid turns the wrong color, the arrest is made. The story details the many ways the field tests can go wrong, so much so that they're generally inadmissible in court. The problem, though, is that the vast majority of such arrests never end up at trial—those arrested typically plea to lesser charges to avoid the possibility of a lengthy sentence. The story uses the example of 43-year-old Amy Albritton, who took a plea deal and three weeks in jail after a field test suggested she had cocaine in her car, no matter how much she insisted to the contrary. She lost her job and her apartment, and her new felony record kept her from getting any kind of meaningful new work. Turns out, the test was a false positive, which she learned only when informed by the journalists working on this story.  Every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence,  write Ryan Gabrielson and Topher Sanders.  At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions.  It's unclear what the standard error rate is on the kits, but follow-up testing at individual departments suggest that it's far from  modest.

Half predict that some beaches will never be the same, and even more doubt fish and bird populations will ever recover. A whopping 71% say President Obama’s not being tough enough on BP. Predictably, respondents weren’t in the mood to forgive BP, either; almost 60% said the company should be forced to pay financial losses even if it drives it out of business. Half said BP had done a  very poor  job handling the crisis—the lowest possible response—while one in four said the same of Obama.

A Philadelphia dealer in historic documents has purchased a reel-to-reel recording from Air Force One following the death of John F. Kennedy, and it’s got 30 minutes of never-before-heard conversations from the trip between Dallas and Washington, the AP reports. Top Kennedy aide Gen. Chester Clifton collected material from the JFK administration, and Philadelphia’s Raab Collection bought his archive after his widow died and is now putting the recording up for sale. It contains in-flight radio calls between the aircraft, the White House Situation Room, Andrews Air Force Base, and a plane that was carrying Kennedy's press secretary and six Cabinet members. A shortened version of the recording is in the National Archives, and the Raab Collection will donate a copy of the long version to the archives and to the JFK Library.  It took decades to analyze the shorter, newer version and it will take years to do the same here,  said Nathan Raab. Among other things, he said the tape will end speculation as to the whereabouts of Kennedy adversary Gen.

She'd been on her way home from the mall after buying clothes for her approaching high school graduation. He'd already had two DUIs—his first when he was 17—and was driving on a suspended license when he killed Caitlin, reports the Chicago Tribune. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit and he had marijuana in his system. Now, after serving five years in prison and two years of probation, police say 34-year-old Stitt was found unconscious up against his steering wheel just before midnight Saturday after allegedly crashing into two parked cars 4 miles from his home. No one's been reported injured. Stitt was arrested when he failed a field sobriety test and charged with felony aggravated DUI, and Palatine police say he's being held on $75,000 bail and due back in court Dec. 15.

His game at a high level at the end of an unusually easy path through a Grand Slam field, Nadal overwhelmed first-time major finalist Anderson 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win his third championship at Flushing Meadows, the AP reports. It is the No. 1-ranked Nadal's second Grand Slam title of the year and 16th overall. Among men, only Roger Federer has more, with 19. Each of those two longtime rivals won two of the four majors in 2017, marking a return of both to the heights of their sport. At No. 32, Anderson was the lowest-ranked US Open men's finalist since the ATP computer rankings began in 1973.

"(Feb 7, 2020  11:22 AM) The impeachment of President Trump revolved around a midsummer phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the holdup of almost $400 million in US military aide to the country in its war with Russia. But according to three Ukrainian officials and an ex-US senior official who talked to BuzzFeed, at least a half-dozen more commercial sales of arms and ammunition worth about $30 million combined haven't yet received approval from the Trump administration—and now Ukraine wants its tens of millions of dollars in down payments back. BuzzFeed's sources note five of the deals have been held up by the US for about a year, while the sixth has been delayed for more than a year, even though such deals typically take about two months to approve, per one of the Ukrainian officials and US State Department guidelines. BuzzFeed notes one of the deals, a $10 million ammunition sale, was first reported by Yahoo News in September, but the other five deals are newly reported. The export license for that ammunition sale, which is said to be the  most critical  for the Ukrainians, was submitted to the State Department in November 2018; down payments for the other five sales were made between January and March of last year. While the three Ukrainian officials aren't sure if the suspension of these six deals are linked to Trump's push to have the Bidens investigated, they do note these deals were delayed before Trump's July call with Zelensky, meaning there may be other reasons at play. In a statement to the Hill, the State Department noted it can't comment  on the status of specific defense trade direct commercial licensing cases  due to import and export regulations.",Report: Ukraine Wants Money Back From US on 6 More Deals

According to Egypt's constitution, Parliament must vote in favor of such a declaration—a virtual certainty since it's packed with supporters of the president, the AP reports. It cannot exceed six months without a referendum to extend it. The army chief-turned-president also dispatched elite troops across the country to protect key installations and accused unidentified countries of fueling instability, saying that  Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations.  The attacks in the northern cities of Tanta and Alexandria highlighted the difficulties facing el-Sissi's government in protecting Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which also left 126 people wounded in the bloodiest day for the country's Christians in decades.

"(Sep 21, 2019  12:40 PM CDT) Boeing isn't the only one to blame. So concludes an impressively detailed New York Times article about two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes since last year—which, it turns out, were caused at least partly by pilot error.  Look, we know as a fact that half of airline pilots graduated in the bottom of their class,  says a former Airbus pilot. Standards are apparently lower in Indonesia, the home country of Lion Air, whose plane went down on October 29 and killed all 189 passengers on board. Deregulated and plagued by accidents, the country's corrupt airline industry has been hiring inexperienced and underpaid pilots for years. When confronted by Boeing technology that pushed down the plane's nose—in theory to help it handle better—the flight crew was baffled. True, Boeing hadn't told pilots about the flawed MCAS system or described it in flight manuals. But the company figured pilots would react wisely when a plane's nose-up-or-down balance, or  trim,  got out of whack, by turning off electrics and reverting to manual trim. But the Lion Air crew failed to do so, and pilots on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302—which went down on March 10, killing 157—lost control amid other blunders. Both planes also suffered from all-too-common mechanical errors. But the lack of rigorous pilot training plays a key role.  In an emergency, it becomes a problem,  an industry expert told Business Insider in March.  If you have a complicated airplane and you basically put a student pilot in there, that's not a good thing.  Read the full article here.

"(Jul 20, 2012  12:48 PM CDT) A sleeping Kenyan family suffered one of the most hellish awakenings imaginable when they were attacked by a pack of hyenas that had entered the family compound. Two children were killed and six other family members were injured in the attack in a village in northeastern Kenya, ABC reports. Five of the injured were treated at a local hospital and released, but a severely injured 10-year-old boy has been airlifted to a hospital in Nairobi.  Rangers pursued and eliminated the hyenas,  said the Kenyan Wildlife Service, which is paying for the injured boy's treatment. The KWS says it is working with the local population on ways to avoid conflict with wild animals, incidents of which are growing along with the human population.

"(Jan 8, 2020  9:15 AM) Money supposedly doesn't buy happiness, but a Japanese billionaire thinks it might at least cheer some people up. Just a couple of weeks after Zozo founder Yusaku Maezawa donated more than $18 million to a Japanese city hit hard by a typhoon, the fashion-minded entrepreneur is back in the news with yet another giveaway. Reuters reports that this time, Maezawa will pony up $9 million, to be distributed in $9,000 bundles to 1,000 lucky recipients, chosen at random after they retweeted his Jan. 1 Twitter post on the matter.  It's a serious social experiment,  Maezawa said in Japanese in an accompanying YouTube video, adding he hopes this initiative piques the interest of those in academia and economics. That's because Maezawa is curious on how the overall concept of universal basic income—an idea often floated by US presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which a nation's citizens receive a regular, guaranteed payment—would affect people's overall well-being and happiness. An economist tells Reuters that what Maezawa is doing is somewhat different than the basic income idea: It's just a one-time payment to each recipient, and in Japan at the moment, people are still finding jobs in general due to a tight labor market. Still, Maezawa wants to see how his  winners  react.  What happens if someone who can't help themselves with their own power is given money ... to rebuild their lives?  he tweeted.

Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Feb. 5 for severe pneumonia and was later put on life support. The Prime Minister's Office says in a statement on its website that Lee  passed away peacefully  at 3:18am. Lee was feared for his authoritarian tactics but insisted that strict limits on speech and public protest were necessary to maintain stability in the multiethnic and multi-religious country. He guided Singapore for 31 years until 1990, making it into a global trade and finance center. Lee's legacy includes an efficient government with little corruption, low tax rates to attract foreign investment, excellent schools, and safe streets. He has faced criticism, though, for using tough tactics to consolidate power. Lee jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians. Lee commanded immense respect among Singaporeans, who this year will celebrate the country's 50th independence anniversary. The Prime Minister's Office said arrangements for the public to pay respects and funeral arrangements will be announced later.",Founding Father of Singapore Dead at 91

"(Aug 14, 2019  4:50 AM CDT) New Zealand officials admitted Wednesday that they made a mistake by allowing the man accused of killing 51 people at two Christchurch mosques to send a hand-written letter from his prison cell. The six-page letter from Brenton Tarrant was posted this week on the website 4chan, which has become notorious as a place for white supremacists to post their views. And it comes at a sensitive time, with other alleged killers from El Paso to Norway citing Tarrant as an inspiration. The letter appears to be written in pencil on a small notepad and is addressed to  Alan  in Russia. Much of it appears to be relatively innocuous, discussing a one-month trip Tarrant says he took to Russia in 2015. But the letter also warns that a  great conflict  is coming and uses language that could be construed as a call to arms, the AP reports. Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis said he didn't believe the prison system should have allowed Tarrant to send the letter.  I have made myself clear that this cannot happen again,  Davis said. But Davis also said that all New Zealand prisoners have rights that include the ability to send and receive mail, though the system has the ability to withhold correspondence and withheld some other letters Tarrant had attempted to send or receive.  We have never had to manage a prisoner like this before—and I have asked questions around whether our laws are now fit for purpose and asked for advice on what changes we may now need to make,  Davis said. In the letter, dated July 4, Tarrant cites Plato and other philosophers and writers as inspiration for his views, and says he  cannot go into any great detail about regrets or feelings as the guards will confiscate my letter if I do  and use it as evidence.",Letter From Alleged Mosque Gunman Appears on 4Chan
"(Sep 24, 2017  11:06 AM CDT) A man's day out with his family resulted in the discovery of a 400-year-old painting of  perhaps one of the most famous gay men in history  by one of the most important painters in history, the Guardian reports. The story is only slightly less surprising because that man was Dr. Bendor Grosvenor of the BBC program Britain's Lost Masterpieces. Grosvenor noticed the painting of George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, during a visit to the historic Pollok House in Glasgow, according to the BBC.  There was this painting further up by the fireplace and it sounds rather silly to say it, but it was a bit of a eureka moment and I thought: ‘My god, that looks like a Rubens,'  the Guardian quotes Grosvenor as saying. The portrait was painted by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens around 1625 but was believed to have been lost. In reality, later artists painting over the background of the portrait—not to mention hundreds of years of dirt and grime—had obscured the work's identity as an original Rubens. It was confirmed as such through X-rays, cleaning, and scientific analysis of the wood it was painted on. The portrait is believed to have been bought by an art collector who owned the Pollok House in the late-1800s, the Telegraph reports. The man who authenticated it calls it a  rare addition to Ruben's portrait oeuvre.  Villiers was a minor noble elevated to duke by James I. Experts believe he was the king's lover, and a secret passageway connected the two men's bedrooms in one of James' residences. The restored portrait will be going on display in a Glasgow museum and art gallery this week.

Born in Japan, Irabu was signed in 1997 with great fanfare by the San Diego Padres, but he was traded to the Yankees the same year; he said they were the only team that interested him. He went 29-20 over 3 years for the team and was traded to the Montreal Expos in 1999 before retiring in 2002, the New York Post reports. He was 34-35 overall, never quite living up to expectations of being the Japanese Nolan Ryan. When Irabu didn’t cover first base in a 1999 exhibition game, then-Yankees owner George Steinbrenner labeled him a  fat, pussy toad,  the Post recalls.

"(Jan 9, 2017  12:06 PM) She's almost there. Opal Lee, 90, set out from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, in September with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in Washington, DC, where she wants to present her petition to President Obama calling for a federal holiday on June 19. That's the day— Juneteenth —that Union soldiers came to Texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around Lee's church last August mushroomed into something bigger.  The people walked with me, and we've been going ever since,  Lee tells NPR.  I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice.  She was right. Invitations started coming, and Lee was happy to take them—in states ranging from Colorado and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition.  I walk wherever I’m invited,  Lee told CBS Pittsburgh during a stop in November.  Two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free.  Lee, who collects donations on GoFundMe, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to Obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count Juneteenth as a holiday, Lee says federal recognition is important.  It would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these United States, so it needs to be observed and celebrated,  she tells Fox4.  Slaves didn't free themselves,  she adds, per NPR.  There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished.  And if her pitch falls short next week? There's a new president coming and Lee plans to keep pushing with him. (Dallas once voted on slavery reparations.)","Woman, 90, on Long Walk to Pitch 'Juneteenth' to Obama"
"(Feb 4, 2015  9:13 AM) A new study finds that, despite your intentions, you may simply be inclined to cheat or not to cheat. As Phys.org reports, humans appear to be the rare mammals that can be either monogamous or polygamous—other species are typically one or the other. And now, University of Oxford researchers say they've found that some humans (53% of women and 43% of men) are more inclined to be faithful, while others (57% of men and 47% of women) are more inclined to be promiscuous.  This research suggests that there may be two distinct types of individuals within each sex, pursuing different mating strategies,  the researchers say of their results, published in Biology Letters. To get these results, the team compared the results from a questionnaire of sexual habits to data on something called the  2D:4D  ratio. That ratio has to do with finger length: The longer your ring finger is when compared to your index finger, the higher the levels of testosterone you were likely exposed to in the womb; these higher levels have been linked to a higher chance of promiscuity.  While not predictive of individual behavior, the length of the ring finger versus the index finger can help identify the group of people who are more likely to be promiscuous,  a University of Oxford press release explains. The researchers compared those results to the questionnaire data because, one explains,  human behavior is influenced by many factors, such as the environment and life experience, and what happens in the womb might only have a modest effect on something as complex as sexual relationships.  (Meanwhile, jealous men and women focus on very different things.)",57% of Men Are Simply More Inclined to Promiscuity

Both Kim and the prosecution have one week to determine whether to appeal. Prosecutors had previously asked for a 15-year prison term. Kim slashed Mark Lippert during a breakfast forum in Seoul, leaving deep gashes on the envoy's face and arm. Lippert, who needed 80 stitches, was treated for five days at a Seoul hospital. Kim has described himself as an anti-US activist. He told police that his assault was meant to protest annual US-South Korean military drills but that he didn't intend to kill the ambassador. Police said Kim attempted to kill Lippert because he knifed him more than twice with a force that was enough to penetrate the ambassador's arm as he tried to block the attack.

"(Jul 2, 2014  8:30 AM CDT) The rhino-like Triceratops, Greek for  three-horned face,  didn't always embody its name in way we picture it doing. By comparing 50 skulls collected over a 15-year period from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, paleontologists have learned that it took between 1 million and 2 million years for the large nasal horn it is famous for today to fully develop, while what started as a long beak shortened over that same time period, the scientists report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Though they've established the evolution, the study's lead author tells USA Today that  it's difficult to say what drove the change.  The first Triceratops skeleton was found in 1887, reports CNN, and was at first thought to be that of a (presumably very large) buffalo. Two years later, a Yale scientist named it Triceratops for its impressive three-horned skull, which the scientists had previously learned changes subtly in shape over the course of a single lifetime as well. A half-million years before their extinction, they roamed the Earth in great numbers, reports UPI, which points out that our understanding of the Triceratops has been greatly boosted by the fact that so many fossils of the creature can be found in the Hell Creek Formation.

Anita Pallenberg was 73; a cause of death was not given. Pallenberg was perhaps best known for her connection to the Rolling Stones—she happily described herself as a hanger-on—for whom she served as a muse. According to the Guardian, Pallenberg got backstage at her first Stones concert in 1965. She supplied guitarist Brian Jones with marijuana and hash and soon started a relationship with him. After Jones reportedly physically abused her, Pallenberg moved on to Keith Richards, with whom she would have three children prior to their split in 1980. Richards has said he was attracted to Pallenberg's artistic sensibility and strength.  I like a high-spirited woman,  the Hollywood Reporter quotes from Richards' memoir.  And with Anita, you knew you were taking on a valkyrie—she who decides who dies in battle.

"(Feb 21, 2017  12:30 PM) It may rhyme with  dud,  but it packs a deadly wallop: A dzud (pronounced 'ZUHD) is an extreme weather phenomenon unique to Mongolia that's characterized by a summer drought and then a prolonged winter of heavy snow and temperatures of minus 40 to minus 59 degrees Fahrenheit. A dzud typically happens once every 12 years, but it has struck for the second consecutive year this winter, and it's putting the livelihoods of more than 150,000 nomadic herders and family members at risk. The dzud last year killed more than 1 million livestock, which are the only source of food, transport, and outside income for almost half of Mongolia's population of 3 million, the Red Cross said last week, as it launched an emergency appeal. More than 40,000 cows and other livestock have already died this time, a figure that's expected to jump in the freezing months ahead and into spring when animals are still weak. Many herder families will lose their livestock and livelihoods  and will have no choice but to migrate to the slum areas on the outskirts of [the capital, Ulaanbaatar] and other urban centers where they will face great social and economic hardship,  said the head of the Beijing office of the International Federation of Red Cross. The Red Cross said 70% of the country is covered by snow, and 157,000 people belonging to herder households in 17 of Mongolia's 21 provinces are at risk. The agency appealed for $650,000 to help 2,740 of the most at-risk families, reports the AP.",A 'Dzud' Comes Every 12 Years. Except for This Time

"(Nov 8, 2017  6:03 AM) Five days before killing 26 people inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Devin Patrick Kelley rubbed elbows with the congregation at the church's annual fall festival. Attendees were surprised to see him with his children at the event—which included a bouncy house and petting zoo—since he was feuding with his mother-in-law from his most recent marriage in 2014. Michelle Shields, who attended the church, was estranged from her daughter, Danielle Shields, who worked there, reports the Houston Chronicle. But  they thought, 'oh this is good. This is progress,'  says a friend of the mother-in-law, adding that Michelle Shields was particularly pleased to see Kelley with her grandchildren. Shortly after 11am Sunday, however, Kelley appeared on a mission to  take care of the mother-in-law,  a commander of the Texas Department of Public Safety tells NBC News, when he emptied 15 30-round magazines inside First Baptist Church. Shields was not inside, but a witness says Kelley yelled,  Everybody die [expletive],  per KSAT. Kelley's troubled past has emerged in the aftermath: He tried to sneak guns onto Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, made death threats against superiors, and escaped a psychiatric hospital after assaulting his then-wife and infant son. He was also accused of rape in 2013, though the investigation halted when Kelley moved out of state; he pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in 2014, per BuzzFeed and CNN.",Killer Was at Church Festival 5 Days Before Shooting

"(Mar 6, 2019  10:30 AM) If you were left feeling concerned after Luke Perry's death after a stroke at age 52, wondering if you, too, are at risk at such a young age—you're not alone. Articles abound in the wake of his death explaining that strokes can happen at any age. But, as the New York Times explains, the  vast majority  of strokes do, in fact, occur in  much older people.  When strokes do occur in younger patients, there are often different causes than those found in older patients. According to two experts who spoke to the Times, those causes can include such uber-specific events as a chiropractic adjustment, sports incident, or roller coaster ride causing an artery to tear and a blood clot to form and travel to the brain. And when strokes do occur in younger people, whose brains have not yet shrunk as they will in older adulthood, they are more at risk of fatal brain swelling, doctors tell USA Today. There are other, less freaky-sounding causes of stroke in the young as well: a hole in the heart, which about 25% of people possess and which makes some of those people more vulnerable to a stroke; a genetic mutation making certain people more prone to blood clots that travel to the brain; a heart defect or rhythm disturbance that causes clots to form and travel to the brain; certain drugs that cause arteries to suddenly narrow or close, cutting off blood flow to the brain; or an aneurysm. Kara Swisher writes in the Times that she, too, had a stroke, at age 49, with none of the usual warning signs such as high blood pressure; in her case, it was a transient ischemic attack, often referred to as a mini-stroke, brought about by the aforementioned hole in the heart, blood prone to clotting, and a long flight to Hong Kong.

"(Feb 1, 2010  6:51 AM) At least 41 people were killed and another 106 injured when a woman blew herself up in a crowd of Shiite pilgrims in Baghdad today. The woman hid the explosives underneath her abaya, a long traditional black garment. Witnesses describe seeing a fireball, and then seeing pilgrims  on the ground, covered in blood and crying for help.  Some did indeed help, driving the injured to hospitals in cars, rather than waiting for ambulances. The pilgrims were en route to Karbala for Arbaeen, the Shiite holiday marking the end of 40 days of mourning for the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson. The annual pilgrimage has been a ripe target for attacks throughout the war; a similar attack killed 32 last year.

"(Nov 20, 2009  9:45 AM) The latest edition of the Fantastic Four of productivity—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook—is worthy but not actually worth buying, writes Farhad Manjoo for Slate. Out next year but now available in a beta edition, Microsoft Office 2010 offers some definite improvements: It lets you preview how text or images you're copying will look before you paste them, for one. But Manjoo can't help but wonder why he even needs a new version—the 2007 and even 2003 editions are fine—and if the product has much of a future. To compete with the likes of Google Docs, the company is both building its own set of free, limited-featured web versions of Office and replacing Microsoft Works on its new computers with a free, scaled-up Office Starter Edition.

Kiana tried to dump the water out using Cierrah's cowboy boot as their dad manned the motor, but it didn't work—and the boat suddenly overturned.  We were a little bit shocked that the boat filled up completely at first,  Kiana tells WGME.  We didn't think we were going to sink.  Kiana was able to get her life jacket on and get the life jackets for her father, who was in shock, and her sister, who's still recovering from a bout with cancer. That's when Kiana knew she was the one who'd have to swim to shore, which she couldn't even see, for help.  I was sad to leave my sister and my dad behind, but I felt like it was the right thing to do,  she tells the Sentinel. The high school senior told herself not to look back at her family and just to keep moving forward through the cold water; after what  seemed like forever,  per the paper, she made it to shore. She'd struggled through 600 yards of choppy water, or the equivalent of six football fields. From the shoreline, Kiana managed to flag down a party boat, and that boat and another vessel rescued Cierrah and the girls' father. EMTs checked all three, who were relatively fine: Other than being cold, there were apparently no other injuries, other than a few scrapes on Kiana's feet and legs.

Kirsten Hatfield disappeared from her bedroom in Midwest City on the night of May 14, 1997, and Anthony Palma, who lived two houses away, was arrested this week on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, KOCO reports. The breakthrough in the cold case came after a new investigator took over in June and discovered that key pieces of evidence—including bloodstains on the girl's bedroom window sill and on her underwear, found in her backyard—were never tested for DNA, reports NBC News. Palma, who was released from prison in 1986 after serving time for assault with a dangerous weapon, still lives in the same home, and an arrest warrant states that he probably stayed there  to conceal evidence of the crime and/or the location of [Kirsten's] body,  reports NBC. Fox 25 reports that the 56-year-old was interviewed after the 1997 disappearance and provided a DNA sample this year when investigators finally tested the evidence and spoke to 10 suspects in the case. Court documents state that the DNA match to the evidence was 293 sextillion to 1. Police believe Palma targeted the girl for sexual assault and killed her soon after her abduction, reports KOCO. Her body has never been found. (A woman thought to have been murdered in 1984 was found alive and well in Dusseldorf.)",Arrest in Case of Girl Taken From Her Bedroom in 1997

"(Aug 2, 2017  7:54 AM CDT) Long-term survival in Joshua Tree National Park is  not impossible but highly improbable,  a spokesperson is warning six days after a couple vanished inside the park's boundaries. Joseph Orbeso, 21, and Rachel Nguyen, 20, of Orange County, Calif., haven't been seen or heard from since setting out on a hike on Thursday, park rep George Land tells the Orange County Register. Their car was found in the northwest area of the park on Friday after the owner of a bed and breakfast in which the couple were staying found they'd failed to check out. Fresh tracks leading from the vehicle suggested they headed north into a canyon, per NPR. However, the tracks also  indicate these people could be walking in circles,  says Land. Of particular concern is the temperature inside the park, which hit 100 degrees on Thursday. There's been no relief for 100 people and K-9 units who've scoured thousands of miles since then. As California Highway Patrol and the US Border Patrol provided air support on Monday, some rescuers even had to be removed from the park because of the heat, reports the Los Angeles Times. The search was scaled back Tuesday due to thunderstorms but was expected to resume Wednesday morning. It will continue until the end of the week, says Land, though he doesn't appear optimistic. Despite a friend referring to Orbeso as a  survivalist,  Land says Orbeso and Nguyen  weren't desert rats. This is a whole different world out here.

"(May 13, 2019  3:05 AM CDT) A 30-year-old Massachusetts man is in custody after the first murder on the Appalachian Trail since 2011. Police say the suspect attacked a man and a woman with a machete on a section of trail in Virginia early Saturday, killing the man and severely injuring the woman, WSLS reports. Wythe County Sheriff Keith Dunagan says the woman pretended to be dead, then took off running when the suspect, James Jordan, walked away after his dog, reports the Washington Post. The woman walked six miles before encountering another group of hikers, who called for help. The sheriff says officers found Jordan and the victim with GPS technology after the man managed to trigger an SOS signal on his phone. Jordan—who went by the name  Sovereign  on the trail—faces federal charges of murder and assault with intent to murder. Appalachian Trail Conservancy spokesman Brian King tells the Daily Beast that Jordan had become  well known  on the trail in recent weeks for threatening hikers. King says Jordan was arrested, fined, and released after an altercation with hikers on the Tennessee/North Carolina border in late April. Authorities say that before Saturday's attack, Jordan threatened a group of four hikers who were camped out. Two fled north and reported the attack to authorities. Jordan initially pursued the two who fled north, then chased and caught up with the two who had fled south, authorities say.",Woman Walks 6 Miles for Help After Appalachian Trail Attack
"(Oct 6, 2011  11:35 AM CDT) The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage this week fell below 4% for the first time ever, to 3.94%. And mortgage rates could fall even further now that the Federal Reserve plans to reshuffle its portfolio of securities to try and lower long-term rates. Freddie Mac said the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped from 4.01% last week, the previous low. The average rate on a 15-year fixed loan, a popular refinancing option, dipped to 3.26%, also a record. Still, rates have been below 5% for all but two weeks in the past year and have done little to boost home sales.

Then one reached toward the officer's belt and grabbed, not his gun, but his cellphone. As the inmate called 911, the others removed the officer's bulletproof vest so they could perform CPR.  It wasn't about who is in jail and who wasn't,  one of the inmates tells WXIA.  It was about a man going down and we had to help him.  Polk County authorities say the officer was supervising a work detail at a cemetery last Monday, in 76-degree heat with 100% humidity, when he told the inmates he wasn't feeling well and soon after collapsed.

"(Apr 9, 2015  8:45 AM CDT) The death of Walter Scott was not the first time Michael Slager has been accused of using excessive force on an unarmed black man. In 2013, the former South Carolina police officer was accused of barging into a North Charleston home and tasing a resident, Mario Givens, for no apparent reason. Givens tells his story in an AP exclusive, recalling that after he answered the pre-dawn knock, Slager wouldn't tell him why he wanted to come in and finally shoved the door open. Givens raised his arms over his head, but says Slager tased him anyway. (The Daily Beast notes that North Charleston cops have been called out for using Tasers excessively, and disproportionately so on black people.) Another officer came in and both dragged Givens outside, threw him to the ground, and cuffed him, he says. He was put in a squad car and accused of resisting the police, but was ultimately released without charge and filed a formal complaint the next day. Slager had gone to the house because Maleah Kiara Brown, the ex of Givens' brother Matthew, had reported waking up in her own nearby home to find Matthew Givens in her bedroom. She went with the officers to the Givens home and, she tells the AP, she screamed to the officers that they had the wrong man—she had provided them with a description of Matthew, 5-foot-5; Mario is over 6 feet tall. She agrees with Mario Givens that he was not resisting when he was tased. She told a police supervisor what she witnessed, but none of those details made it into the investigative report after Givens complained—she says that she was never contacted as part of the internal investigation. Givens says he wasn't either, nor were other witnesses who had also contacted police and were willing to give statements, and when he went to ask the status six weeks after complaining, he was told the case had been closed. In the wake of Scott's death and Slager's firing, a police rep says the case will now be reviewed.",SC Officer Was Accused of Excessive Force in 2013

A Mideast carrier plans to offer a much, much tonier experience than first-class for those who can afford it: airline suites. Etihad Airways yesterday detailed the three-room suites that will be built into its new Airbus A380s; the 125-square-foot  Residence by Etihad  will be made up of a bedroom big enough for two, private bath complete with shower, and living room outfitted with leather seats, a chilled minibar, and a 32-inch flat-screen TV. And it'll come with another big perk: a white-gloved personal butler trained in London. The suites will ultimately be available on New York routes, but the first will appear in December on the Abu Dhabi-to-London journey, at a price of $21,000—one way. For those looking to spend a little less, CNN reports that the new A380s will also contain nine  First Apartments,  which feature a full-length bed, lounge seat, minibar, wardrobe, and TV.

"(May 3, 2016  9:08 AM CDT) The megahit musical Hamilton has grabbed a record-breaking 16 Tony Award nominations, the biggest haul in Broadway history and another notch in the show's march into theatrical history. Lin-Manuel Miranda's hip-hop-flavored biography about the first US treasury secretary broke the 15-nominations record Tuesday held by The Producers and Billy Elliot. Hamilton was nominated in virtually every category it could compete in, from acting to scenic design. Next month, it will compete for Broadway's biggest crown—best new musical—with Bright Star, School of Rock, Shuffle Along, and Waitress. The New York Times notes that those competitors probably realize they don't have much of a shot against Miranda's powerhouse production, but they know the nomination itself may help boost ticket sales for their own musicals. Deadline reports Hamilton has already brought in a never-before-seen $80 million in advance ticket sales since it began its official Great White Way run in August. Meanwhile, the best play category is composed of Eclipsed, The Father, The Humans, and King Charles III.

"(Feb 23, 2015  6:35 PM) The US named its first international envoy for gay rights today, tasking a veteran diplomat with leading the country's efforts to fight violence and discrimination against LGBT individuals overseas. Randy Berry, currently the consul general in the Netherlands, will promote human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, says John Kerry. A longtime foreign service officer, Berry has served at US posts in Bangladesh, Egypt, Uganda, and South Africa, and speaks Spanish and Arabic.  Defending and promoting the human rights of LGBT persons is at the core of our commitment to advancing human rights globally—the heart and conscience of our diplomacy,  Kerry says. He cited overturning laws that still criminalize same-sex activity in more than 75 countries as a specific priority. Long in the works, Berry's appointment as a special envoy is the latest move by the Obama administration to make LGBT rights a prominent part of its human rights efforts around the world. Earlier this year, the White House for the first time included human rights protection for LGBT people in its formal national security strategy. The announcement also comes amid a heightened public focus on transgender rights. Ash Carter, on his first overseas trip as defense secretary, suggested he was open to allowing transgender people to serve openly in the US military.

"(Sep 12, 2018  1:48 PM CDT) The creator of Designing Women and Evening Shade, described by the Hollywood Reporter as one of CBS' biggest hitmakers, has written a powerful piece for the Reporter taking disgraced former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves to task. But, as the headline of Linda Bloodworth Thomason's piece notes,  not all harassment is sexual.  Rather, Moonves carried out a  personal vendetta  to keep Bloodworth Thomason's shows off the network and keep her out of work for seven years right at the  pinnacle  of her career, she alleges. Before he took over, her shows were celebrated by CBS execs and she was given  carte blanche  to tackle such subjects as sexual harassment and domestic violence. Then in 1995, three years after she was given the largest writing and producing contract in the network's history at $50 million, Moonves took the reins. He proceeded to decline all of her pilots, all while keeping her hope alive that eventually something would end up on air. She doesn't know why he sidelined her, though she wonders if her shows'  admittedly aggressive, feminist agenda  had something to do with it. Over the years, she watched as he turned CBS from a network that championed strong female characters to a network full of  macho crime shows featuring a virtual genocide of dead naked hotties in morgue drawers.  And so she bids Moonves good riddance, writing she's  happy to dance on his professional grave.  To all the sexual predators in the entertainment industry, she warns,  We are not going to stop until every last one of you is gone. We don't care anymore if you go to jail or go to hell.

The Tsarnaev brothers are ethnic Chechens—though they never actually lived in Chechnya—and Tamerlan visited Russia for six months last year, reports CNN.

NTSB officials declined to comment directly on whether a petition calling for a fresh investigation will indeed lead to a new probe. But they stressed that there was no radar evidence of anything  intercepting the plane,  and that the patterns of damage were not consistent with a bomb or missile strike, Politico reports.

"(Aug 12, 2017  3:52 PM CDT) In March 1945, 83 German prisoners of war escaped a prison camp in South Wales. It was the biggest escape of German prisoners during World War II, and now—thanks to a report published earlier this month in the Journal of Conflict Archaeology—we know how they did it. Camp 198 in Bridgend was built to house 1,600 German officers and was one of what were ultimately 1,026 camps—numbered sequentially—in the UK, the Conversation reports. The conditions at Camp 198 no doubt made escape not only inviting but also possible: The report notes  camp security measures were generally poor,  with  lack of either sentry towers and perimeter fence lighting, and this provided good cover for escape tunnels to be constructed.  Researchers using ground-based surface scanning, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistivity discovered the location of a tunnel originating in Camp 198's Hut 9, which was preserved for scientists to study when the rest of the camp was demolished in the 1990s. The tunnel was relatively shallow—less than 5 feet below ground. And while its entrance was sealed by concrete, the inside was  remarkably intact,  with the walls and ceiling still supported by bed posts and other items from the prisoners' huts. Researchers also found a false wall in a shower room behind which the prisoners had hidden the dirt removed from the tunnel. None of the 83 German POWs who escaped Camp 198 made it back to Germany.

No, this particular coin that went to auction Thursday evening in Tampa, Fl., sold for just under $2 million. The 1894-S dime was struck at the San Francisco Mint. Only 24 were made, and only nine likely still exist.  There's a couple of iconic rarities in the rare coin market,  says David Hall, co-founder of Professional Coin Grading Service.  A couple of coins have been known among the rarest of the rare for 100 years and this is one of those numismatic icons.

"(Dec 28, 2015  5:28 AM) Ellsworth Kelly, widely seen as one of the greatest artists America has ever produced, has died at his home in upstate New York after 70 years of creating his own style of abstract art. He was 92. Kelly started out in an artistic US Army unit in France during World War II, designing camouflage patterns and creating fake tanks to deceive the Germans about the size of Allied forces, NPR reports. After the war, he returned to Paris to study art under the GI Bill, creating what Vulture calls a  uniquely American study of abstraction, form, and color  despite his distance from US contemporaries. In the '50s, he returned to New York, where art historian Sarah Rich tells NPR he was put off by the  corny expressionism and epic self-importance  of other leading abstract painters. Kelly told the New York Times in 1996 that he started out painting things like patterns seen on sidewalk grates before moving to purely abstract paintings.  I wondered, 'Can I make a painting with just five panels of color in a row?'  he said.  I loved it, but I didn't think the world would. They'd think, 'It's not enough.'  His reputation grew over the decades as his style continued to evolve, and his paintings and sculptures can now be found in almost every major museum of modern art, NPR notes. He also created many public installations over the years, including a stirring installation at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.

"(Feb 21, 2012  12:20 PM) It's not your imagination: This year's Republican primary season really has been drastically more negative than usual. In 2008, just 6% of GOP primary campaign advertising attacked other Republicans, but this year that figure has shot to 51%, the Washington Post reports. The tone of the ads has gotten worse too; in 2008, one Mitt Romney attack ad was sure to call John McCain an  honorable man.  This year's ads aren’t nearly so nice; one Gingrich ad, for instance, accuses Romney of taking  blood money.  The driving force behind these attacks: super PACs. Since these groups can't coordinate with their chosen candidates, they have to rely on stock footage.  If they didn't run comparison or contrast ads, they would have some very boring television,  says one GOP ad man. Plus, candidates needn't  approve this message  on super PAC ads, making attacks less dangerous. Still, the strategy isn't without its pitfalls—one GOP strategist notes that Romney and his super PAC have run the most negative ads, and  his favorable impression among independents has collapsed.","Stats Prove It: 2012 Race Much, Much Nastier"
"(Mar 29, 2017  7:09 AM CDT) Two anti-abortion activists whose secretly recorded conversations with executives from Planned Parenthood made national headlines are each facing 15 felony charges in California, reports the Los Angeles Times. David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt posed as executives of a fake bioresearch company and filmed their conversations with Planned Parenthood officials about obtaining fetal tissue. They posted the resulting videos in 2015 via the Center for Medical Progress, accusing Planned Parenthood of being in the business of illegally harvesting and selling organs from aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood says the videos were deceptively edited. Now, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has charged the pair with filming 14 people without their permission, plus an additional count of conspiracy to invade privacy.  The right to privacy is a cornerstone of California’s Constitution, and a right that is foundational in a free democratic society,  said Becerra.  We will not tolerate the criminal recording of confidential conversations.  Daleiden called the charges  bogus  and tells the Washington Post that he and Merritt were engaged in  citizen journalism.  Similar charges against the pair in Texas were eventually dropped. Planned Parenthood, for its part, faced investigations in about a dozen states over the videos, but those have resulted in no charges.  As we have said from the beginning ...

A Change.org petition calling on HBO to remake the eighth and final season of the show  with competent writers  launched last Thursday and saw a huge spike in support this week, reports People. It went from 15,000 signatures to more than 250,000 on Wednesday alone, per CNBC. As of Thursday morning, more than 360,000 had signed the petition claiming showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss are  woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material (i.e. the books) to fall back on.  By 9am EDT Friday, that number was nearly 800,000. Sunday's penultimate episode riled critics, with the Guardian's Sarah Hughes noting  it felt as though Benioff and Weiss were doing little more than gleefully destroying the world they once carefully depicted.  Per CNBC, many others have complained that Benioff and Weiss are  rushing toward its ending and straying from established character arcs.  But don't count Stephen King among the critics. He had this to say Thursday on Twitter:  I've loved this last season of GoT, including Dani going bugshit all over King's Landing.

The 33-year-old was sentenced to four months in jail and told to pay a roughly $1,300 fine. He admitted in court that he was trying to reach her to receive compensation or a  thank you  for work he did on their apartment:  It was stupid,  he said yesterday, RFI reports.  At the time my logic was that until she returns the money, she pays back for work I carried in our apartment, or at least says thank you, I would not stop the calls.  Indeed, he kept up the harassment until she finally expressed her thanks in a meeting organized by a mediator. Before then, she'd tried blocking his calls, but he just called her parents instead, according to the woman's lawyer. The 32-year-old ex apparently received an average of 73 calls per day, including 100 during the hour-and-a-half she spent filing charges against him. She  suffered a lot,  says her lawyer, but has since  enjoyed a fantastic summer time, with no phone calls, and hopes it will last.

The procedure was seen as a medical breakthrough at the time, notes the AP. Dinoire died in April, but her death wasn't announced until Tuesday, as the French woman's family originally hoped to keep it private. The BBC reports Dinoire had been happy with the results of the transplant but not with the international attention it brought her. The announcement of her death mentioned only a long illness, but the BBC reports Dinoire died from cancer, to which she was vulnerable because of the immunosuppressants needed to keep her body from rejecting her new face. The Guardian reports Dinoire wanted  to forget  her problems when she took sleeping pills in 2005. When she came to, she went to light a cigarette only to discover her pet dog had chewed off her mouth and nose. She believed her dog was trying to save her.

The 79-year-old Argentine survives without running water or electricity in his cavern high in a mountain in northern Tucuman province. When he gets hungry he picks up his rifle and goes hunting or heads on a three-hour trek down the mountain to the nearest settlement, reports the AP. A creek is his main source of water. His cave mates? Eleven roosters and two goats that roam the mountainside during the day and return at night looking for shelter from pumas and other predators. The crows of the roosters wake him up at around 3am every morning and he begins the day by starting a fire.  Fire is magical,  he says, as the smoke fills his cave. Town dwellers often give Luca food and supplies. He buys candles, yeast, and corn with a government old-age pension, worth about $100 to $200, that he collects at the town's post office. His only technological gadget is a small, battery-powered radio, but he has a hard time tuning into stations because the signal is weak up the mountain. Luca says he always wanted to live in isolation. He left San Pedro de Colalao at age 14 to travel northern Argentina and earn a living transporting coal to Bolivia, but returned to the area and the cave.

Several arrests later, in 2013, she said again that she was leaving that life behind. But police say Payne, now 85, is at it again: She was recently arrested and charged with pocketing a $690 pair of earrings from a Saks Fifth Avenue department store at a mall in Atlanta. A store security guard watching surveillance video saw Payne enter a Christian Dior boutique inside the department store and take the earrings from a standing shelf before quickly leaving, the police report says. She was arrested in the mall, and the earrings were found in her pocket, the report says.

"(Nov 4, 2017  6:00 AM CDT) US authorities on Friday released a 10-year-old immigrant girl with cerebral palsy who had been detained by border agents after surgery because she is in the US without legal permission. The ACLU and US Rep. Joaquin Castro said that Rosa Maria Hernandez was returned Friday afternoon to her family, the AP reports. Her parents brought her into the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was a toddler, and they live in the Texas border city of Laredo. A cousin who is an American citizen took Rosa Maria from Laredo to a children's hospital in Corpus Christi on Oct. 24, where she was scheduled to have emergency gallbladder surgery. To get to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles away, she had to pass through an interior checkpoint in South Texas operated by the Border Patrol. Border Patrol agents followed Rosa Maria and the cousin to the hospital, then took the girl into custody after the surgery and transported her to a facility in San Antonio for unaccompanied immigrant minors, under the custody of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The Border Patrol has said it had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission. The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria's behalf Tuesday, argued that the US government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and endangered Rosa Maria's health by not sending her home. While Rosa Maria has been reunited with her family, she still faces the threat of deportation. Tan said Friday that Border Patrol agents had issued Rosa Maria a notice to appear in immigration court, but that the case had yet to move forward.",10-Year-Old Who Was Detained After Surgery Released

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ no one from the rehab facility called the county coroner—and now both the coroner and the LA County Sheriff's Department are suspicious and are investigating Kelly's death. Another cause of their suspicion: The rehab doctor said an embolism caused Kelly's death, but the coroner says there's no way he could have known that without doing an autopsy.

The six-week delay (a change of tune for the White House) isn't because of website difficulties, but because people weren't certain when the penalty came into effect, officials tell the Washington Post. It hadn't been clear whether Americans simply had to sign up for a plan before the penalty took effect, or whether their coverage itself had to begin by that date, the Post and MarketWatch explain. Because of the way health insurance is processed, Americans would have needed to apply by Feb. 15 for coverage to kick in March 31; now, people won't be penalized as long as they've signed up by March 31, in which case their coverage would start May 1.

In August, a hunter shot an elderly roe deer bearing a single, centered antler in the forests of Slovenia, reports National Geographic. It's not uncommon to find deer with just a  spike —what a remaining antler is called after one is lost; even an injury to a buck's hind leg can cause an abnormality. But in this case, both antlers had fused into one, giving a unicorn-like appearance. This was a first for scientist Boštjan Pokorny, who confirmed the roe deer's fantastical and  untypical  deformity, which National Geographic notes was probably caused by an injury sustained as the antlers were forming, which is an annual occurrence. The roe deer lived to be quite old and was a little pudgy, leading Pokorny to infer his unusual deformity didn't hold him back in life. Meanwhile, on another continent, another hunter also recently bagged a  unicorn deer.

"(Sep 25, 2019  2:50 PM CDT) As the word dropped from Wendell Brown's lips, the former college football player and Detroit native appeared to try to relish its taste for just a moment more:  Freedom.  After three years in a Chinese prison for allegedly assaulting a man during a bar fight, Brown returned home Wednesday to the hugs and smiling faces of his loved ones, the AP reports. Outside of his family's brick house on Detroit's east side, he took a few moments to reflect on regaining his freedom.  We don't really understand that word to its fullest extent until (we're) without it,  Brown said.  Hallelujah! I'm free!  Brown, 32, was hesitant Wednesday to discuss the Chongqing bar incident, which he referred to as a  minor altercation,  or his treatment in prison.  I'm just very fortunate that it's over,  he said, adding that he will soon head to Florida to see his 12-year-old son. Brown, who played at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Detroit and Ball State University in Indiana, was teaching English and coaching American football in southwestern China when he was arrested in September 2016 and charged with intentional assault. Brown, who was the only person prosecuted over the incident, denied hitting the man and said he was defending himself after being attacked. And witnesses said Brown was being harassed by other patrons. However, the court ruled that he  didn't do enough to de-escalate the situation,  according to the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based rights monitoring group. Brown was sentenced to four years in prison, but a Chinese court later reduced it to three years, saying that was due to apologies and expressions of forgiveness between Brown and others involved in the fight, as well as Brown's payment of $28,750 in compensation.",US Football Player Released After 3 Years in Chinese Prison
"(Jan 8, 2013  4:39 PM) Before we start feeling too special about our home planet, scientists have a message: There are at least 17 billion planets the size of Earth in the Milky Way alone, Space.com reports. About 17% of our galaxy's stars have Earth-size exoplanets closely orbiting them—so 100 billion stars in the galaxy means 17 billion such planets. And half those stars have tightly-orbiting planets that are Earth-size or larger. That's just the beginning: Further from the stars, there are probably planets that could actually support life.  These kind of rocky objects are everywhere,  says an astronomer. Indeed, the Kepler Space Telescope, which finds planets by noting stars' dimming as planets pass, found 2,700 planetary candidates in 22 months of searching—and simulations suggest that 90% of the candidates the telescope finds are in fact planets. Overall, there are likely 100 billion alien planets in our galaxy.",Milky Way Has 17B Planets the Size of Ours

Whistleblowers have come forward accusing the Service of a host of sexual misconduct across 17 countries, Sen. Ron Johnson revealed yesterday. Johnson wouldn't divulge the particulars, but sources tell the Washington Post that the improprieties include hiring prostitutes, visiting bordellos while on work trips, extramarital affairs, and engaging in both one-night flings and long-term relationships with foreign nationals. In one case, an agent missed a military transport flight because he was drunk in a Thai brothel. He was flown home on an expensive commercial flight, but was never punished. The revelations come just days after a fresh scandal broke around supervisor Ignacio Zamora's misplaced bullet and lewd texts. It turns out Zamora had helped lead the agency's internal investigation of the Colombia incident, Johnson revealed, likening it to  the fox guarding the hen house.  The agents involved in the Colombia scandal have long argued that their behavior was not unusual.

"(Sep 7, 2018  12:10 AM CDT) There was a health scare at Philadelphia International Airport Thursday after two separate American Airlines flights from Europe arrived with sick passengers—the day after an Emirates plane was quarantined at JFK because of passenger illness. The Philadelphia flights arrived from Munich and Paris but as with the Emirates flight, some of the passengers with flu-like symptoms were returning from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, where there has been an outbreak of flu, NBC Philadelphia reports. Officials say all 250 passengers and crew on the Philadelphia flights were held for a medical review out of an  abundance of caution,  reports Reuters. The CDC says it worked with local health officials to  evaluate and test the ill passengers for influenza and other respiratory illnesses.  The agency says 12 passengers  reported sore throat and cough; none were identified with fever.  Nobody was hospitalized and the 12 passengers who were tested for flu have now been released. As for the Emirates flight, authorities say 11 passengers on the flight from Dubai were hospitalized and treated for influenza or other common respiratory diseases, the New York Times reports.

"(Oct 22, 2018  1:55 AM CDT) The nation's largest police force suffered a major setback to its body camera program Sunday after one of them blew up. Officials said Sunday that use of 2,990 Vievu-brand LE-5 cameras has been suspended because of the incident in a Staten Island station house, NBC News reports. Police say the officer was on his way out for a midnight shift early Sunday when he noticed smoke coming out of the device, NY1 reports. It exploded after he removed it from his shirt but the officer wasn't injured, police say. The explosion  revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite,  police say.  Equipping the NYPD with the best equipment is a paramount priority,  a police spokeswoman said in a statement.  All officers assigned LE-5 cameras were instructed to immediately remove the cameras and bring them back to their commands.  The camera is in use in 19 precincts across the city. The NYPD, which had planned to outfit all 23,000 officers with body cameras by the end of December, has deployed 15,500 so far. The earlier LE-4 model is not affected by the recall, police say. The New York Times reports that controversy erupted over the contract for the Vievu cameras in 2016 when it emerged that other forces had complained about their quality.

"(Jun 27, 2018  2:32 PM CDT) For some 3.2 million Americans who work in the private sector, it has apparently seemed like a good deal: Lock in their monthly federal student-loan payments at 10% of their discretionary income. Make those payment for 20 years (25 if it's graduate school debt, notes Forbes). Hit that date and see whatever is left wiped away—and there might be a ton left, as the payments are often smaller than the interest that's being accrued. The Wall Street Journal reports these  income-driven repayment plans  have been available through the Education Department since 2007, meaning balances won't start going to zero until 2027. And when they do, expect a  bomb.  That's because the balance that's forgiven is considered income for that year, meaning the borrower has to pay tax on it. The Journal does the math: One estimate expects such borrowers to have $41,000 forgiven on average. At a 25% income tax rate, that would mean a $10,250 tax bill. On the more eye-popping end of the spectrum, it references an orthodontist it interviewed who had student-loan debt in excess of $1 million; that associated tax bill could be $700,000. (Forbes notes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program doesn't levy taxes on the forgiven amount).  I'm very doubtful that everybody is going to be able to make these tax payments,  said Constantine Yannelis, who worked in the Treasury Department under Obama. The IRS could place liens on homes or garnish Social Security checks, but some experts expect that as 2027 approaches, Congress will see heavy pressure to act; eliminating the tax could put taxpayers on the hook for billions in student-loan costs.",A Student-Loan Debt 'Bomb' Is Going to Go Off in 2027
"(Jun 11, 2020  3:48 AM CDT) The US has passed yet another grim milestone in the pandemic. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US hit the 2 million mark Wednesday night, with almost 113,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, tells CNN that deaths could top 200,000 by September.

"(Oct 31, 2011  7:00 AM CDT) Passengers on three JetBlue planes and an American Airlines plane found themselves stuck on the tarmac near Hartford, Conn., for 7 hours or more on Saturday after being diverted from New York-area airports—and when they were finally allowed out, many had no choice but to sleep in the terminal. Passengers told their stories to the AP: One man whose flight from Fort Lauderdale was rerouted says he sat there from 1:30pm to 9pm; snacks and bottled water ran out, and  the toilets were backed up. When you flushed, nothing would happen.  One man on an American Airlines flight from France says passengers heard a range of reasons for the delay, from the need to refuel to the airport's limited capacity for handling international flights. A traveler from Boston had a similar experience.  We were told we were the third plane in line to get to the gate when we landed,  he said.  Then we stayed on the plane for seven hours.  JetBlue confirmed that thanks to a  confluence of events,  such as equipment failures that prevented planes from landing in low visibility at New York-area airports, some of its planes were diverted to Bradley International Airport, where power outages reportedly made deplaning tricky.

"(Apr 11, 2016  12:44 PM CDT) A  suicide epidemic  that started last fall in a northern Ontario community—with 11 suicide attempts this past Saturday alone, per the CBC—has led the Attawapiskat First Nation to declare a state of emergency, per the National Post. The remote enclave of 2,000 people has reportedly experienced suicides for decades, but the latest string is so worrisome that the Attawapiskat community is pleading for help. Resident Jackie Hookimaw says the latest string of deaths was spurred by the fall suicide of her 13-year-old great-niece. Chief Bruce Shisheesh tells the CBC that 101 people between the ages of 11 and 71 have attempted suicide since September; one has died.  I'm asking friends, government, that we need help in our community,  Shisheesh says.  I have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives.  Members of the Attawapiskat community say citizens suffering from drug abuse, overcrowding, and bullying—as well as intense poverty, per the BBC—don't receive enough government help.

"(Feb 26, 2019  12:38 PM) Being able to say,  The baby is finally sleeping through the night  may offer a mental boost, but that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to be getting a lot more shut-eye anytime soon. In fact, don't count on it for at least six years, the Telegraph reports, based on a new study out of the University of Warwick that found parents were still somewhat sleep-deprived a half-dozen years after their bundle of joy showed up. The study, published in the journal Sleep, pored over the sleep patterns from 2008 to 2015 of more than 4,600 parents who'd welcomed a new baby. Not surprisingly, the first three months are the worst, sucking an average of an hour a night away from a new mom's sleep, while new dads lost an average of 15 minutes, per a release. But when the little ones got to the ages of between 4 and 6, researchers found the parents were still sleeping less than they did before they'd conceived: 20 minutes less per night, on average, for the mothers, and (still) 15 minutes less for dads. Sleep deprivation took a stronger hold on first-time parents than on those who'd done this routine before. Study co-author Sakari Lemola offers a theory on why Mr. Sandman still seems to elude parents of preschoolers:  While having children is a major source of joy for most parents, it is possible that increased demands and responsibilities associated with the role as a parent lead to shorter sleep and decreased sleep quality,  even long after the crib has been stored in the garage.

But the doses of Narcan they administered couldn't save the teen. Nathan Wylie died of a suspected heroin overdose on Saturday, four days after he was taken to a Dayton, Ohio, hospital, reports the Dayton Daily News. Officials say Nathan had access to drugs because his father is an addict. Wylie had already been arrested for child endangerment after another minor who lived at Wylie's home sent a relative a photo of white powder, a razor blade, and a crack pipe in the home in Feb. 2016, police say. He was later arrested for drug possession after he was found with heroin and crack cocaine during a traffic stop in December, with Nathan in the backseat, police say, per CBS News. It isn't clear why Nathan remained at the residence. A rep for Montgomery County Children Services tells the Daily News only that there was  a case open with this family  and that Nathan's sibling was removed from the home following Nathan's death.

The 40-year-old, whom the BBC calls  the Tiger Woods of poker,  was found to have cheated in order to win the money while playing a version of baccarat at Crockfords Club in Mayfair in 2012. He's been fighting to get the millions ever since, insisting the strategy he used to win wasn't illegal. His case against Genting Casinos UK, the owner of Crockfords, was dismissed last year, and he challenged that dismissal. But on Wednesday, Britain's Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, the AP reports. Ivey and a colleague used a technique called  edge sorting,  in which they got the croupier to unknowingly arrange the cards in a way that allowed Ivey and the other player to figure out what cards were being dealt, based on small differences in the pattern on the back of the cards, and bet accordingly. Crockfords returned his stake but never paid out the winnings, leading to the court battle. The Supreme Court found what Ivey did was definitely cheating, but after the ruling Ivey maintained his innocence.

Robert Pruett, initially sentenced to 99 years in prison as an accomplice to a 1995 murder when he was 15, was then sentenced to death in 2002 over the 1999 killing of guard Daniel Nagle at a prison near Corpus Christi, but he maintains he was framed. Pruett, now 35, had been punished for eating in an unauthorized area and the disciplinary report was found torn up near Nagle's body with traces of what one DNA test revealed was Nagle's blood. A judge halted yesterday's scheduled lethal injection so DNA testing could be performed on a metal shank used to stab the guard, the Guardian reports. The test should be completed by May 28, Reuters reports. In halting the execution, Judge Bert Richardson said that though attempts by Pruett's lawyers to delay his death  appear to be unreasonable, it is not clear they, in fact, are unreasonable.  A Texas Department of Criminal Justice rep tells the AP Pruett was  excited to hear the news.  Pruett argues he was framed for Nagle's murder just as he was about to file a grievance describing corruption and safety concerns at the prison. His blood or fingerprints have not been found on the shank so far, nor was Nagle's blood found on Pruett, though several inmates testified against him; some were rewarded with better treatment.

But it was style as much as substance that was on display last night:  a calm president, coolly giving the appearance that he would help the country recover from the state it's in.  It might not have been a great change from earlier pressers, Madden admits, but it was  probably exactly what the White House wanted.",No-Shock Barack Aces Day 100 Presser
"(May 18, 2016  1:22 PM CDT) In 2012, hackers posted 6.5 million stolen LinkedIn passwords to a Russian forum, TechCrunch reports. It turns out, that security breach was much bigger and much worse than possibly anyone realized. According to Motherboard, 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords taken as part of the same breach were just put up for sale by a hacker named  Peace,  who is seeking $2,200 for them on the dark web. LinkedIn has confirmed the emails and passwords are legit and is working on contacting affected users. Back in 2012, LinkedIn never specified how many accounts had been compromised by hackers. Ars Technica reports it's possible even the company didn't know how many passwords had been stolen initially. Hackers have apparently had no trouble with the lightly encrypted passwords. One source claims hackers cracked 90% of the stolen passwords within 72 hours. Ars Technica argues many of the passwords should never have been allowed by LinkedIn in the first place. More than 750,000 users had the password  123456.  More than 170,000 used  linkedin.  Other popular passwords were  password  and  111111.  People who were using LinkedIn in 2012, still have the same password, and use that password for other websites should be concerned, according to TechCrunch, which says it's best to change your password on LinkedIn (and anywhere else you used it) just in case.",117M LinkedIn Users Just Had Passwords Leaked
"(Sep 6, 2017  6:23 PM CDT) Facebook says a Russian  troll farm  appears to have spent $100,000 on 3,300 digital ads targeting American voters in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, the Washington Post reports. While some of the ads expressly mentioned Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, the majority simply promoted  divisive  views on things like gun and gay rights, discrimination, and immigration. According to Reuters, the ads were linked to 470  inauthentic  accounts and pages that have since been suspended. While Facebook isn't releasing the ads, the names of the suspended pages featured words like  patriot  and  refugee,  the Guardian reports. The Russian company linked to the ads has a history of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda. Facebook said it also found $50,000 spent on 2,200  potentially politically related  ads that may be tied to Russia. The company's findings are more evidence to back the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia influenced the election. The findings are also likely to make investigators question whether the Russians were getting input on ad buys from people in the US. The ad buys may have been a violation of US election law by Facebook and others involved.  It is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state, or local election, directly or indirectly,  a member of the US Federal Election Commission tells Reuters. Facebook found no evidence tying the ads to any presidential campaign.",$100K in Pre-Election Facebook Ads Tied to Russian 'Troll Farm'
"(Jun 28, 2012  7:47 AM CDT) Forget $2 billion; JPMorgan's trading losses on its bad derivative bets could reach a jaw-dropping $9 billion, sources tell the New York Times, based on an internal company report. Jamie Dimon had warned investors that the $2 billion loss could double within a few quarters, but losses have gotten much worse much faster than anticipated. That's in part because the bank is dumping its position faster than anticipated—the most volatile half is already off the books. Part of the total losses will be announced when JPMorgan releases its second-quarter earnings on July 13. Some more optimistic observers expect the loss to top out at $6 billion or $7 billion, but that will still be more than enough to reignite debate over how tightly proprietary trading should be regulated.

May, who was known as just Gita Hall when the photograph was taken by Richard Avedon more than 50 years ago, is now 79. She says she only consented to the photo being used in a Revlon ad, and accuses the show of secretly cropping her image from the ad and using it  for commercial purposes,  according to the Hollywood Reporter. Why did she wait so long to sue? She doesn't have cable, so she only just discovered the use of her face when Mad Men came out on video last year. The lawsuit calls May's image the centerpiece of the title sequence, stating that it  perfectly personifies the period  by representing the  iconic female beauty of the age.  She wants to be compensated for the  revenues that her image contributed to their profit,  which stands at an estimated $1 billion.

"(Jan 21, 2016  6:15 AM) Volvo has just come out with a gutsy move, making what CNN Money is calling a  shocking pledge —that not a single person will be killed or even seriously injured in a new Volvo car or SUV by 2020. (Not including a driver who does something  really, really stupid,  as CNN puts it.) Engineers already have some ground to stand on, given that not a single person has died in the Volvo XC90 over the past four years. And while it's in an elite squad, that model isn't alone—eight others claim the distinction. To reach its goal, Volvo (and other car makers working on similar safety features, including Ford and Tesla) is leaning heavily on autonomous technologies, reports Extreme Tech. Some of the features are run-of-the-mill—think better air bags and restraints—while others are more advanced, including adaptive cruise control, pedestrian and large animal detection, sign reading, and an assist to keep the vehicle between lane lines.  Still, claiming something to be death-proof seems risky,  notes the Extreme Tech post.  They said the Titanic was unsinkable, after all.  Meanwhile, a review in Automobile Magazine calls the XC90 the  future of luxury transportation  with  crisp  handling and steering that provides  decent feedback.  It also notes that Volvo is planning to test its latest autonomy technology on 30 miles of highway in Sweden next year, while the Obama administration recently announced a $4 billion pilot program to study the tech further.

"(Jul 4, 2014  3:25 PM CDT) George Washington, America's first president, can claim 1,513 namesakes alive in the US today, according to a new WhitePages analysis, but that actually ranks fourth on the list of most popular Founding Father names. Second president John Adams tops the list with 9,893, while Revolutionary War financier Robert Morris comes in second at 7,367 (perhaps both are a coincidence given John and Robert as well as Adams and Morris are common to begin with). Congressman and famous signature-writer John Hancock, meanwhile, claims a far more modest (but likely more intentional) 1,616 namesakes, ranking a distant third.  It's interesting to note that the top two most common names, John Adams and Robert Morris, are most popular in Florida,  says Liz Powell, culture and trend expert from WhitePages, in a news release.  While Florida may have been the 27th state to enter the Union, it is the number one state for patriotic names.  Only one name, meanwhile, belongs to a woman (WhitePages admits she wasn't a Founding Father but gave her a spot all the same), and that's seamstress Betsy Ross. She came in 14th on the list of 14 with 163 namesakes. And while several names are probably to be expected (Samuel Adams comes in 5th place, Thomas Jefferson in 8th, and Benjamin Franklin in 9th), Abraham Lincoln's name is rather mysteriously missing. In the realm of more general patriotic names, LiveScience points out that Liberty ranked 532nd as far as girls' baby names go last year; America took the 777th spot.

"(Mar 28, 2014  6:05 PM CDT) General Motors is boosting by 971,000 the number of small cars being recalled worldwide for a defective ignition switch, saying cars from the model years 2008-2011 may have gotten the part as a replacement. The company previously announced the recall of 1.6 million cars, only through the 2007 model year, which were built with the faulty switch. The recall involves six cars: the Chevrolet Cobalt, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac G5, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion, and Saturn Sky. GM says it sold 95,000 faulty switches to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers for use as replacement parts. Of those, 90,000 were used to repair vehicles from the 2003-2007 model years. But 5,000 of the switches were used to fix cars from the 2008-2011 model years. GM said it doesn't know which cars got those 5,000 switches, so it needs to recall all of them. Of the cars being added to the recall, 824,000 were sold in the US. The ignition switches can move out of the  run  position and cause the car's engine to stall. It can also knock out power steering and power brakes, making the vehicle harder to maneuver, and disable the air bags. GM has said the defect is linked to at least 12 deaths in cars from the 2003-2007 models years, though a watchdog group puts the figure much higher. The company said it isn't aware of any fatalities connected to the defect in the 2008-2011 models.

"(Feb 20, 2017  9:50 AM) Andy Sandness didn't want to die—but he didn't realize that until he tried to take his own life on Dec. 23, 2006. The  super, super depressed  21-year-old Wyoming man had shot himself beneath the chin with a rifle; when police arrived, he begged them to save his life. Doctors did, but Dr. Samir Mardini, the plastic surgeon who worked to reconstruct his face—which was missing a nose, jaw, and all but two of his teeth—over eight surgeries at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., couldn't quite save his face. That is, until June 16, when Sandness became the Mayo Clinic's first face transplant recipient in a 56-hour surgery. Mardini had first broached the possibility with him in 2012, but it wasn't until January 2016, and 50 Saturdays Mardini and his team spent trialing the surgery using cadavers, that Sandness' name was placed on an organ donor waiting list, reports the AP. The man whose face would become his own was Calen  Rudy  Ross, a 21-year-old Minnesota man who in June 2016 shot himself in the head, leaving behind his eight-months-pregnant wife, who was wary of the transplant idea at first but ultimately consented. Mardini said when the doctors studied Ross' photo,  we got chills when we actually saw how close they were in hair color, skin. It could be his cousin.  Three weeks after the surgery, Sandness finally saw his face, and, still unable to speak, wrote,  Far exceeded my expectations.  What those expectations had been: a working nose (he wore a prosthesis that regularly fell off), the ability to eat normally (his inch-wide mouth was too narrow for a spoon), and to  get good stares as opposed to bad stares.

But now the death toll is 91 and still rising. Massive bones, some already bleached by the blistering sun in the Hwange National Park, litter the landscape around one remote watering hole where 18 carcasses were found. Officials say cyanide used in gold mining was spread by poachers over flat  salt pans,  also known as natural, mineral-rich salt licks. They say lions, hyenas, and vultures have died from feeding on contaminated carcasses or drinking nearby. The poachers are after the elephants' ivory, of course, a trade that Quartz estimates to be worth between $7 billion to $10 billion a year thanks to booming interest in China and other Asian nations. Worse, terrorist groups such as al-Shabab—the network behind the mall attack in Kenya—get up to 40% of their money through the trade.

He was 89. His attorney tells the AP that King died peacefully in his sleep. Although he had continued to perform well into his 80s, the 15-time Grammy winner suffered from diabetes and had been in declining health during the past year. He collapsed during a concert in Chicago last October, later blaming dehydration and exhaustion. For most of a career spanning nearly 70 years and more than 50 albums, King was not only the undisputed king of the blues, but a mentor to scores of guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Otis Rush, Jimi Hendrix, and Keith Richards. A preacher uncle taught him to play, and he honed his technique in abject poverty in the Mississippi Delta, the birthplace of the blues.

And as long as people have problems, the blues can never die.  Still, the Delta's influence was undeniable. King began picking cotton on tenant farms around Indianola, Miss., before he was a teenager and was still working off sharecropping debts after he got out of the Army during World War II.

Police say Willie Noble, 48, opened fire on a group of seven teenagers in a car late at night after they dumped eggs and leaves on his son's car, reports USA Today. Front seat passenger Adrian Broadway, 15, was shot in the head and died and the driver suffered injuries to his arm, CNN reports. The surviving teens say that after a night at the movies, they decided to play a prank on Noble's 17-year-old son as payback for a prank he played on them last Halloween.  It was a joke.

"(Jan 4, 2013  6:54 AM) More depressing news on the New York City subway last night, as two police officers were shot while stopping a man moving between cars on the Brooklyn-bound N-train, reports the New York Times. Two plainclothes cops asked the rider to leave the train with them, but, after initially appearing to do so, the man shot them both—one officer in the back, and the other in the thigh and groin. The former's bulletproof vest prevented more serious injury; he returned fire with seven shots, killing the man. Both cops are in the hospital now, in stable condition. It wasn't the only subway-related story in the Times today: The paper also takes a look at the psychological battles that can plague those behind the controls. Dozens of people jump or fall to their deaths on the New York subways each year—55 in 2012—and images of the deaths can plague operators, who get three days off when a passenger is killed. Many take more unpaid time off to recover, and some never return to the job.  As cruel as it makes it sound, for the individual it's over,  says a former operator whose train killed a man in 1992.  It’s just beginning for the train operator.  (The Times reports that a third police officer was also shot last night, while off duty at his family's car dealership in the Bronx.

"(Dec 9, 2016  3:55 AM) A man who killed an Alabama convenience store clerk more than two decades ago was put to death Thursday night, an execution that required two consciousness tests as the inmate heaved and coughed 13 minutes into the lethal injection. Ronald Bert Smith Jr., 45, was pronounced dead at 11:05pm, about 30 minutes after the procedure began at the state prison in southwest Alabama. Smith was convicted of capital murder in the Nov. 8, 1994, fatal shooting of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. A jury voted 7-5 to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, but a judge overrode that recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. Smith, who pistol-whipped Wilson and shot him in the head, replied,  No ma'am  when asked by the prison warden if he had any final words. US Supreme Court justices put the execution on hold twice Thursday as Smith's attorneys argued for a delay, saying a judge shouldn't have been able to impose the death penalty when a jury recommended he receive life imprisonment. Four liberal justices said they would have halted the execution, but five were needed to do so. As the execution began, Smith heaved and coughed repeatedly, clenching his fists and raising his head, the AP reports. A prison guard performed two consciousness checks before the final two lethal drugs were administered. During the first one, Smith moved his arm, according to the AP. He slightly raised his right arm again after the second consciousness test. The state prison commissioner said he did not see any reaction.  We do know we followed our protocol.

"(Jan 29, 2014  8:32 AM) An absolutely amazing story out of Oklahoma, where a Texas 16-year-old survived a 3,500-foot fall in a skydiving mishap—and didn't even require any surgery for her injuries. Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects.  I have no idea how she survived,  one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment:  She didn't do what she was supposed to do,  he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a  corrective counter action  to make her parachute  stop turning.  He claims the chute did open fully but somehow,  maybe ... initiated by her,  started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, Fox News Insider reports.","Teen Survives 3,500-Foot Fall"

The sheer number of items on the restaurant's menu has grown substantially over the past few decades: A 1990 Fortune poll found 33 different menu offerings (not counting varying sizes); by the end of 2014, there were 121 items, a restaurant consultant says.

The solid piece of granite—known in Riverside, Calif., simply as  the rock —is making the 60-mile journey from a quarry to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Press-Enterprise reports.

Who wouldn't like the idea of changing your life in just three weeks?  asks James Clear at the Huffington Post. Unfortunately, it's also just not true. Clear traces the history of the myth back to a 1960 book by plastic surgeon Maxwell Maltz, who observed that it tended to take patients at least 21 days to adjust to their new faces and other bodily changes—the key words being  at least.  Over time, those words fell away and  21 days  gained fame as the hard-and-fast rule. So how long does it really take? Clear dug up a 2009 study in which researchers followed 96 people as they tried to adopt new habits (example: drinking a bottle of water with lunch). The results? Subjects reported behaviors becoming automatic in an average of 66 days. For some it took as little as 18, but for others it stretched as long as 254. Bottom line: Building habits takes time.

"(Mar 20, 2019  9:45 AM CDT) Theresa May formally asked the European Union on Wednesday to postpone Britain's departure from the bloc—due in nine days—until June 30. But a frustrated EU has warned it could keep Britain waiting for an answer. In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, May said the Brexit process  clearly will not be completed before 29 March, 2019,  the date fixed in law two years ago for Britain's departure. The AP reports she said she wanted to set out her reasons for the June 30 request to EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Opposition politicians and pro-EU members of May's Conservative government had urged a longer extension, saying a delay of just a few months could leave Britain once again facing a cliff-edge  no-deal  Brexit this summer. Withdrawing without a deal could mean huge disruption for businesses and people in the UK and the 27 remaining EU countries. But a long extension would infuriate the pro-Brexit wing of May's divided party and would require Britain to participate in May 23-26 elections for the European Parliament. May said that would be unacceptable.  As prime minister I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30,  she said in the House of Commons, noting a longer delay would result in Parliament spending  endless hours contemplating its navel on Brexit.  A delay to Britain's withdrawal requires the approval of all 27 remaining EU countries—and that's not guaranteed.

"(Mar 24, 2016  5:55 PM CDT) Japanese whalers sailed to the Antarctic in December with the goal of killing 333 minke whales. Discover reports they returned Thursday having met that goal. Japan signed on to an international moratorium banning whale hunting in 1986 but has since been taking advantage of a loophole that allows killing whales in the name of  scientific research.  In what can only be seen as a particularly bold claim, Japan says it's killing whales as part of research meant to prove there are enough whales for them to hunt commercially. For years the country has insisted most whales aren't actually endangered, seeking to return to hunting whales for food, according to Reuters. But the UN says that's exactly what's happening now under the guise of scientific research. Japan openly admits that the meat from the whales killed in the name of science is used for food, including in school lunches. That prompted the UN to ban Japan's hunt last year, Gizmodo reports. For one year, Japan managed to conduct its research without killing any whales before falling back on claims that killing is necessary. This year's haul was the largest in years. Approximately 90% of the mature female whales killed in this year's hunt were pregnant, which Japan says shows their  breeding situation  is  healthy.

So investigators exhumed her body three months later, sent her fingers to the Wellington Fingerprints Branch, and reburied her, reports stuff.co.nz. The circumstances surrounding her case remain mysterious, and for decades her fingers were held in the care of New Zealand Police Forensics Collection, used to demonstrate how to care for post-mortem remains. In the 1990s, as forensics procedures evolved, the fingers were sent to the New Zealand Police Museum, and now, at long last, they have been reunited with Fendell in a small ceremony by the sea. Fendell is actually the 33rd out of 37 people whose remains are being repatriated by police, though hers is the first case where living relatives were involved, the New Zealand Police note.  The previous 32 repatriations we have completed have been for individuals who have been unidentifiable or have had no living relatives who could be identified,  the museum's director says. After working their way down the family tree, they found Fendell's great-nephew Brian Collinge, who attended the ceremony.

"(Jan 5, 2015  12:49 PM) Two prospects from the US Ski Team were killed in an avalanche today while skiing near their European training base in the Austrian Alps. The US ski team said Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, died in the incident near the Rettenbach glacier near Soelden, the venue for the annual season-opening World Cup races. Berlack, from Franconia, NH, and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers descending from the 3,056-meter Gaislachkogel when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four escaped unhurt. Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures.  Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport—both on the race course and skiing the mountain,  US Ski and Snowboard Association President Tiger Shaw said.  Both of them loved what they did.  Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers following two top-20 finishes at the 2013 US national championships and a spring tryout camp. Astle was invited to train with the development team this season after strong early season results, including two top-10 results at NorAm Cup races last month in Canada. Berlack and Astle were part of a group of 10 skiers on the development team who gained experience in the Europa Cup and were preparing to race on the top-level World Cup.

The detainees are accused of collaborating with the exiled Dalai Lama to fuel unrest in the troubled region. State media did not say whether they have been formally charged. Ethnic Han, who dominate commerce in Lhasa and other Tibetan cities, were the targets of violent rioting in March that dented Beijing’s image ahead of the Olympics. Chinese officials recently started handing out multiple-year prison terms to some of the protesters, including Tibetan monks.

"(May 18, 2015  9:00 AM CDT) Nurse Aruna Shanbaug was 25 when a cleaner at the Mumbai hospital in which she worked sodomized and choked her with metal dog chains. That was Nov. 27, 1973. Left brain-dead and paralyzed, she was kept alive by doctors at King Edward Memorial Hospital who fed her through a feeding tube for four decades. Six days ago, she developed pneumonia; Shanbaug passed away today, just shy of her 68th birthday, the Times of India reports. While alive, Shanbaug became the face of a euthanasia debate in India, whose Supreme Court denied a request to let her die in 2011, the BBC reports.  My broken, battered baby bird finally flew away,  says Pinki Virani, a journalist and author who filed the case rejected by the Supreme Court and wrote extensively about Shanbaug's plight.  And she gave India a passive euthanasia law before doing so.  Though Virani had hoped the court would order the hospital to stop feeding Shanbaug, it instead sided with hospital bosses, who argued Shanbaug  accepts food ... and responds by facial expressions.  But the BBC notes the case did lead to a loosening of  some restrictions on euthanasia.  A terminally ill patient in India can now be taken off life support in exceptional circumstances if family members want that to happen. (The Wall Street Journal explains that because Shanbaug's parents were dead, the hospital was considered her caregiver, hence the court siding with it.) Her attacker, Sohanlal Bharta Walmiki, served seven years for attempted murder and robbery but was never charged with rape because sodomy wasn't mentioned in India's rape laws.  Perhaps she is paying for what she did in her last life,  a nurse says in Virani's book, Aruna's Story, per Firstpost.  Perhaps, like your Jesus Christ, she is paying for all our sins.",Raped Nurse Dies After 42 Years in Coma
"(Jul 14, 2020  4:58 PM CDT) Tunisian blogger Emna Charqui has been sentenced to six months in prison over a Facebook post about coronavirus prevention. The 27-year-old shared a post about hand-washing and social distancing that was written in a style that mimicked a verse from the Koran, the BBC reports. Other social media users said Charqui, an atheist, should be punished for the  offensive  post, which she shared on May 2. Amnesty International said the prosecution was  yet another illustration of how, despite Tunisia's democratic progress, the authorities continue to use repressive law to undermine freedom of expression.  Days after Charqui shared the post, which was created by an Algerian atheist, she was charged with  inciting hatred between religions.  Charqui plans to appeal the ruling. Weeks after she was charged, she told France24 that she had received death threats. She said she had only meant to share information about the pandemic in a humorous way.  I'm really scared because I had no bad intentions, I didn't think it would take on such a scale and that we would end up with threats,  she said.

"(Dec 31, 2013  5:18 PM) A small Missouri brewery has responded to a cease and desist letter from Starbucks by sending the coffee chain a check to cover what it calls the profit from use of the word  Frappicino —a check for $6. Exit 6 Pub and Brewery in the St. Louis suburb of Cottleville named one of its brews the Frappicino, spelled slightly differently than the word Starbucks uses for its blended beverages. That prompted an attorney for Starbucks to send Exit 6 a letter on Dec. 9, which noted that the Seattle-based company  is the owner of a number of world-famous trademarks, including the well-known FRAPPUCCINO trademark.  The letter also said that the words are  phonetically identical  and that Exit 6's use of Frappicino  is likely to cause confusion, mistake.  In his sarcastic response letter, Exit 6 owner Jeff Britton also wrote that the brewery  never thought that our beer drinking customers would have thought that the alcoholic beverage coming out of the tap would have actually been coffee from one of the many, many, many stores located a few blocks away.  The letter said Exit 6 would no longer use the term  Frappicino  and would instead refer to its beer as  The F Word.  Britton said in a telephone interview that the new batch of  The F Word  sold out in three hours.

That's how much a bidder paid for the chance to watch as da Vinci's famous painting is removed from its case for its annual inspection. Sky News reports that museumgoers usually can get no closer than 15 feet away from the Paris museum's most famous piece of art. But each year, the Mona Lisa is taken out from behind the bulletproof glass that protects it so that conservation experts can examine it more closely—it's long been warping and cracking. The winner of a recent Christie's auction designed to benefit the Louvre will now get to witness this. Forbes notes the winner will also get a private tour of the museum's Grande Galerie, which features works by Italian greats such as Caravaggio and Raphael. The Mona Lisa event is one of the  once-in-a-lifetime experiences  the Louvre is auctioning off to try to raise money to offset the hit it's taken this year during the COVID-19 pandemic; a Louvre staffer tells Sky the museum is set to lose up to $110 million in 2020 revenue.

"(Feb 17, 2018  10:15 AM) British student Joanna Parrish disappeared in France after posting an advertisement for her services as an English teacher in a local newspaper, the Telegraph reports. A day after she was reported missing, her naked body was found in a river; she had been raped and strangled to death. That was nearly 30 years ago. This week a French serial killer known as the Ogre of the Ardennes is said to have confessed to the crime, according to AFP. Didier Seban, a lawyer for Parrish's family, tells the BBC that 75-year-old Michel Fourniret confessed to the 1990 murder of Parrish—as well as the 1988 murder of Marie-Angele Domece, whose body was never found—to judges  two to three times  over the past week. The Press Association reports Parrish's family was shocked by the confession. Fourniret was given life in prison in 2008 after being found guilty of raping and killing seven women between the ages of 12 and 21. His wife, Monique Olivier, was also given life in prison for picking up a number of his victims while driving around with their baby. Fourniret was charged with the murders of Parrish and Domece in 2008 after Olivier said he was responsible for them, only to have the cases dismissed in 2011 after Olivier recanted. A court of appeal later cancelled that dismissal and ordered investigations into new leads. Now Seban says a trial should go forward after Fourniret  made detailed and repeated confessions.

But his parents don't want him to get chemotherapy, and they've lost custody of him as a result.  We want him to be treated with something that has less side effects,  Bland-Ball tells WFLA.  Chemotherapy is so brutal on a body.  After the Florida couple left Hillsborough County with Noah Monday, authorities launched an urgent search for the boy, saying his parents had failed to bring him to a  medically necessary hospital procedure  the week prior and that he was in need of  lifesaving medical care.  The family was found in Kentucky within hours, and Noah was taken away from his parents; authorities say he is  now being medically treated,  per the Washington Post. His parents are fighting to get him back, with a custody hearing set for Friday. According to his mom, who posts frequently on Facebook about the case, two rounds of chemo were done, Noah was declared cancer-free less than two weeks after he was diagnosed, and the family planned to follow up with alternative treatments, including vitamins and herbs. In a post Tuesday, Bland-Ball said,  His blood results from yesterday showed a healthier boy than ever, which we knew.

Something more than questionable fashion should stand out, according to new data from the CDC, which finds the average weight of a US woman is now 166.2 pounds—about the same weight as the average man in the 1960s—up from about 140 pounds during that time, reports the Washington Post. That's an increase of 18.5%. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6% gain. Is it as bad as it seems? Essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: Americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35% of Americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69% of adults are either overweight or obese, reports CBS Atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18% between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found Americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of Tonga and Micronesia.

Thirty-three-year-old mom Louann Bowers, who gave birth in her cellblock last week, ran away from a nearby Pennsylvania town at age 16, possibly because she had become involved with Sinhue Johnson—the children's father, now in his mid-40s—who was definitely her uncle by marriage.

"(Oct 22, 2015  6:52 AM CDT) A teacher and a student were killed and another student and teacher were seriously injured in a sword attack at a school in the Swedish town of Trollhattan on Thursday, before the assailant was shot by police and taken to a hospital. Police say a masked man in his 20s used  several knife-like objects  as weapons in the cafe area of the Kronan school around 10am, per the Local and CNN. Two boys, 11 and 15, suffered serious stab wounds; one of them died later in the hospital, while the teacher died at the scene, per the BBC. A hospital rep adds the attacker  is seriously injured and is being operated on.  The scene outside the school is still chaotic, where  parents are running around to find their children,  says a witness.  I can't understand why it happened here.  A student tells the Local,  I was in a classroom with my class when one of my classmates' sisters called her to warn her that there was a murderer at the school.  He says he and a few others left the classroom to warn their teacher, who was in the hallway.  Then I saw the murderer, he was wearing a mask and had a sword. Our teacher got stabbed,  he says.  The murderer started chasing me, I ran into another classroom. If I had not run, I would have been murdered.  Earlier in the day, the school held a meeting based on teachers' concerns that anyone could gain access to the school through the entrance to the cafe, which is reportedly attached to the school and is meant for adults, per CBS News. There are about 400 students at the school, aged 6 to 15.","1 Dead, Several Injured in Sword Attack on School"

"(Mar 5, 2020  11:39 AM) Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged the former president of the United Auto Workers with corruption, alleging he conspired with others at the union to embezzle more than $1 million, per the AP. Gary Jones, who quit his post in November, has been under scrutiny for months. Agents conducted a public search of his suburban Detroit home last summer. Key allies also have pleaded guilty as part of the government's sweeping corruption probe. Jones was charged with conspiracy in a document titled a criminal  information,  which signals that a guilty plea is likely. Ten union officials and an official's spouse have pleaded guilty since 2017. The investigation began with the discovery that Fiat Chrysler money from a Fiat Chrysler-UAW job-training center was stolen.

"(Feb 11, 2015  8:34 AM) Deah Barakat, a second-year dental student at UNC-Chapel Hill, had scheduled a trip to Turkey this summer to provide dental care to Syrian refugees there. Those dreams were cut short yesterday when the 23-year-old, his 21-year-old wife, and her 19-year-old sister were shot dead in an apartment complex near the college, NBC News reports. Craig Stephen Hicks, the suspected 46-year-old gunman, is being held in Durham County Jail on three charges of first-degree murder, police say. Police received a report of gunfire shortly after 5pm yesterday in the Chapel Hill neighborhood of Finley Forest; all three victims died at the scene. In a statement today, CHPD reports  our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking.  The Charlotte Observer notes that all three victims were Muslim, and speculation is rife on social media that it could have been a hate crime. The Independent notes a Facebook page in Hicks' name that shows him to be an apparent supporter for  Atheists for Equality  and a frequent poster of images that mock religion. What CHPD has to say:  We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case.  Barakat's wife, Yusor Abu-Salha, was scheduled to start dental studies at UNC in the fall; the two worked together to lobby for global public health and had just married on Dec. 27 (wedding photo here).

"(Apr 6, 2010  1:43 AM CDT) A 15-year-old South African farm worker has confessed to fatally bludgeoning Eugene Terreblanche after the white supremacist refused to pay him wages. A co-worker  started hitting Terreblanche with four blows to the head. Then my son took the iron rod and hit him with three blows,  said the mom of the teen, who hasn't been identified because he's a minor.  My son was a person who doesn't like to be in trouble.  The account doesn't entirely match conclusions of police who recovered a club and machete at the murder scene. Nor does the teen's account satisfy Terreblanche's supporters, who say the murder had more to do with politics than wages. Security will be stepped up when the boy appears with his 28-year-old accused accomplice for a court appearance expected to be attended by as many as 2,000 people, reports the Telegraph.

"(May 13, 2014  9:04 AM CDT) AT&T is in active talks to buy DirecTV for around $50 billion, multiple outlets are reporting, with the deal potentially coming in a matter of weeks. The move could have implications for Comcast's purchase of Time Warner, because anti-regulators may want to look at both deals together, the New York Times reports, adding that the AT&T talks actually began in earnest right after the Time Warner deal was announced.  With DirecTV they are getting a national TV presence—they can sell TV with wireless nationwide,  one analyst tells Bloomberg. The exact price is still up in the air; Reuters sources say it's in the  low- to mid-$90 per share  range, while Bloomberg says it could be as high as $100 per share. Also still in the air is the fate of DirecTV CEO Mike White, who isn't expected to step down—but does reportedly plan to retire after 2015. Some industry sources speculate that the entire deal is a feint intended to land the real apple of AT&T's eye, Dish Network.

"(Dec 26, 2019  8:52 AM) In 1989, Long Island carpenter Dennis Amodeo won 36 Corvettes (one from each production year stretching back to 1953) in a VH1 contest—and what a long, strange trip it's been for the cars since. Now, after years of gathering dust in various New York City parking garages, the entire collection is about to be given away in a 2020 sweepstakes, with each car up for grabs for the cost of a $3 raffle ticket. The New York Times reports on the  Lost Corvettes  contest sponsored by Corvette Heroes, the group set up by the two families—the Hellers and the Spindlers—who own the cars. Hagerty.com reports they acquired them in 2014, but not from Amodeo. They've been out of his possession since shortly after the VH1 contest, when artist Peter Max purchased them in the hopes of painting the cars and using them in an art project. Max got into trouble with the IRS, however, and briefly went to prison, and the cars never got painted. The cars have over the years have moved from parking garage to parking garage all over the city. Not many of the cars—which will be given away individually, with the money going to veterans-related charities—are collector's items, though Chevrolet only made 300 of the 1953 model; there are only about 100 or so left. The 1956 model, meanwhile, painted an unusual Cascade Green shade, was used in an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld and Jimmy Fallon.

"(Jun 14, 2019  1:44 PM CDT) By last count, six tourists had died under mysterious circumstances in the Dominican Republic over the last year or so, and now there's a seventh and an eighth. NBC News reports 53-year-old Leyla Cox of Staten Island died earlier this week at Punta Cana's Excellence resort. The family of 78-year-old American Jerry Curran also recently revealed that he died at the Dreams hotel there in January. This follows the death of two tourists at the island's Hard Rock resort (one in July 2018, one this past April), the death of a Pennsylvania woman in May at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville, and the deaths of a Maryland couple and a Philly woman at the Grand Bahia Principe la Romana—two in May, one in June. Meanwhile, a Denver couple that vacationed on the island in June 2018 tell Contact7 they also became sick at the Grand Bahia Principe. Back in the US, doctors told them they likely had pesticide poisoning; they now have a $1 million suit against the resort. At least three of the deaths have been tied to pulmonary edemas. Per the New York Post, cops and the FBI are looking into whether tainted alcohol may have played a role in any of the deaths, as some of the victims drank from their hotel mini-bars before falling ill. And, in what seems to be completely unrelated to the recent sicknesses, the family of a Florida surfer who went missing in the Dominican Republic in January 2016 is hoping that the current media attention on the illnesses, as well as on the shooting of ex-Red Sox star David Ortiz, will reinvigorate his case. Darryl Fornatora, then 45, was on vacation there with friend Matthew Rigby, but although Rigby came home, Fornatora didn't—and the family wonders if Rigby knows something.

"(Feb 19, 2013  2:23 PM) Thinking about  pope  as your career goal? Consider the retirement package, which is apparently around $3,340 per month. That's how much Pope Benedict will get when he abdicates later this month, and while it may seem a bit low for someone who was the leader of the entire Roman Catholic Church, also consider the fact that most if not all of his expenses will be covered by the Vatican after he retires. (He'll be living there, for one thing. In fact, the question of  what exactly does he need $3,340 per month for  has already been raised, the Independent reports.

The company that owns Kay Jewelers—which is near the Jensen Beach, Fla., gun store that reported Mateen to the FBI—wouldn't confirm the buy, but it said they are  mourning and are working closely with the authorities.  ABC also spoke to one of Mateen's wife's middle school teachers. She says Noor Zahi Salman was enrolled in special education classes.

"(Jan 20, 2015  10:07 AM) The Telegraph calls it  one of the strangest cases of déjà vu ever recorded in medical history : A 23-year-old British man can't lead a normal life because he feels he's  trapped in a time loop,  as he describes it. When his episodes first started in 2007, just after he started university, his déjà vu sometimes lasted just a few minutes at a time. But those episodes got worse, and by 2010, he was no longer able to watch TV, listen to the radio, or read because of persistent feelings of having  encountered the content before.  He also dropped out of school. His case was written up last month in the Journal of Medical Case Reports, and the report notes that unlike many patients (such as those with dementia) who experience chronic déjà vu, this man  is fully aware of the false nature of his  and had no memory problems. He's also not subject to any of the neurological conditions (like temporal lobe epilepsy) typically associated with déjà vu.  Rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar,  says report author Dr. Christine Wells. Wells believes this could be the first-ever case of anxiety causing persistent déjà vu: The man had a history of anxiety, particularly in regards to contamination (he's a frequent hand washer) and that anxiety got worse when he started university. Perhaps anxiety caused  mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety,  Wells tells the Telegraph. However, the report also notes that after the déjà vu started, the man took LSD once,  and from then on the déjà vu was fairly continuous.

"(Feb 17, 2016  7:20 AM) Six weeks after her arrival at Rikers Island, an argument over who should clean a shower sent Candie Hailey to solitary confinement—known as  the bing.  It was the first time, but it would not be the last. Of her first 29 months in jail, Hailey served about 27 alone in a 6-by-10-foot cell, with a bed, toilet, and a few books. And she had yet to be tried for any crime, let alone convicted. Among infractions that sent her to the bing: cursing at an officer and splashing the guard with toilet water (70 days), fighting (40 days), and disrespect of staff (30 days). At least eight times during her more than three-year incarceration, she was hospitalized after suicide attempts in solitary. Hailey had never been diagnosed with mental health issues before Rikers, but jail doctors soon found she had borderline character disorder, mood disorder, and anti-social personality disorder. Hailey's stay at Rikers—detailed in official documents and hours of interviews—is a case study in solitary confinement and its consequences. Many criminal justice experts say officials too often rely on solitary, disregarding the effect on troubled inmates like Hailey. Long-term isolation can induce anxiety, depression, and anger, and studies have found a lack of medical and psychiatric care can make it worse. Hailey finally had her trial last May, with a verdict of not guilty, after spending 2 1/3 years in solitary. Since she was freed, she's been unable to regain custody of her children; fallen out with her family; and struggled to find employment and housing. She's tried to kill herself twice.

"(Sep 27, 2016  1:05 PM CDT) A compassionate police officer in Ohio turned a traffic ticket into a road trip over the weekend, with the recipient of his kind deed calling the experience  overwhelming.  Mark Ross found out Sunday morning his 15-year-old sister had died in a car accident, and he needed to get from Indiana to Detroit to be with his family, Inside Edition reports. Because he didn't have his own car, he begged a friend to drive him to Michigan—but he probably asked the wrong person. As they were speeding through Ohio, police lights started flashing, and Ross knew they were in trouble.  I knew I was going to jail due to a petty warrant,  Ross wrote in a Facebook post, per KTLA 5. The driver also had an outstanding warrant, so he got taken into custody and the car was towed. But what happened to Ross next blew his mind. A second cop, Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. David Robison, showed up at the scene and heard what had happened to Ross' sister.  I explained … I needed to get to my mother asap,  Ross writes.  I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry.  Robison offered to take Ross the remaining 100 miles to Detroit, where he dropped him off at a local coffee shop so a cousin could pick him up.  Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops but I am truly Greatful [sic] for this Guy. He gave me hope,  Ross writes. Robison also told Ross he'd like to attend the funeral to pay his respects.

"(Jul 2, 2017  12:33 PM CDT) Researchers call it one of the  last frontiers of human colonization : very high elevations where the oxygen is sparse and the temperatures are icy. Now research out of the Andean highlands of South America suggests the humans who braved such conditions more than 7,000 years ago did so in an impressive manner—year-round. As a press release explains, prior research established the presence of hunter-gatherers in the higher elevations of southern Peru as many as 9,000 years ago, but there was much debate over whether their occupation was seasonal or permanent. A team led by University of Wyoming researchers set out to answer the question by excavating a Peruvian site 12,500 feet above sea level. That's more than twice as high as Denver, notes USA Today, and so high that lead researcher Randy Haas says he's seen people faint after deplaning at the regional airport there. The team uncovered the remains of 16 people along with some 80,000 artifacts and then looked at these factors: oxygen and carbon isotopes in the human bones, the demographics of those bones, the travel distance to low-elevation zones, and the makeup of the uncovered tools. The results constitute the  strongest empirical support to date for permanent occupation  there, per the study, published in the Royal Society Open Science: the bones revealed low oxygen and high carbon isotope values,  revealing the distinct signature  of permanent occupation; the travel time to a low-elevation zone was too long to be undertaken seasonally; that women and children were part of the group made a low-elevation migration even unlikelier; and their tools were almost exclusively made with stones found at high-elevations.","At 12K Feet, Humans Did the Unimaginable"
"(Jun 11, 2014  6:59 AM CDT) Stability is deteriorating quickly in Iraq, where officials are confirming that Islamist militants have seized control of a second city, Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. Officials tell the AP that the provincial governor based in Tikrit is missing, while the New York Times notes that militants encountered precious little resistance and appear to be on their way to Baghdad. They've taken over the town of Baiji, an oil-refining center with 200,000 residents, and they've done so  without firing a shot,  the Times notes. The militants hold a power station that supplies Baghdad and beyond, and residents in the capital fear the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) could come their way next. And with Iraq having lost control of its second-largest city to the Islamist militants, some 500,000 Mosul residents have fled, a watchdog says.  The situation is chaotic inside the city, and there is nobody to help us,  a government worker tells the BBC. An Iraqi provincial official has indicated that leaders are strategizing to retake Mosul, but troops are showing fatigue.  The state is weak,  a deserting soldier tells the Times.  This will be an endless battle.  The US says it will continue to provide  some security assistance  to Iraq, but the government must  step up to the plate  in a push against ISIS, the Guardian reports.

Tekerrious  TK  Jackson's death—witnessed by the father's girlfriend, who stopped the beating only long enough to show Duncan how to  whoop  the child properly— was the culmination of 2 weeks of abuse while TK was visiting his father for the summer. Duncan told police he caught the boy not sleeping after his 7pm bedtime Saturday, setting off a flood of violence aimed at getting TK to  man up  that ended only when the boy died.

"(Nov 10, 2014  2:00 AM) About 1.6 million people in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia voted yesterday in favor of breaking away from the country in a mock independence poll, but more Catalans avoided voting, either because of the poll's questionable legality or their opposition to secession. Results released early this morning, with 88% of votes counted, showed that more than 2 million people voted in total. But 5.4 million were eligible to vote, meaning many didn't bother to participate in the nonbinding poll. Catalan lawmakers opted for the watered-down poll after plans to hold an official referendum on independence were suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court.  I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,  says one teacher.  Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.  The court then suspended the mock vote on the same grounds Tuesday. But the regional government defied the suspension, manning polling stations with 40,000 volunteers.  Despite the enormous impediments, we have been able to get out the ballot boxes and vote,  Catalan president Artur Mas said after depositing his ballot at a school in Barcelona. Polls in recent years say the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence, while around half support cutting centuries-old ties with Spain. Mas has said the vote was only symbolic. It likely will lead to regional elections that would stand in for a referendum on independence, unless the Spanish government relents.  We ask the world to help us convince the Spanish institutions that Catalonia deserves to vote a referendum to decide its future,  Mas said.","2M Catalans Diss Spain, Vote in Declawed Poll"

Yahoo News reports senators Rand Paul and John McCain are having a bit of a tiff this week after McCain called Paul out on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. McCain was seeking a vote on a Senate bill—expected to be widely supported—in favor of Montenegro's efforts to join NATO. According to Politico, 23 of 28 NATO member nations have already voted in favor of Montenegro joining—but Russia is strenuously opposed to it. McCain claimed anyone who didn't support the bill would be  carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin.  After Paul blocked a vote on the bill and left the Senate, McCain went further, accusing Paul directly of  working for Vladimir Putin.  Paul responded to McCain's comments Thursday, and he didn't pull any punches.  I think maybe he's gotten a little bit unhinged,  Paul said, adding that McCain  makes a really, really strong case for term limits.  And he accused McCain of possibly being  past his prime.  Paul justified his opposition to the Montenegro bill by saying that the US military has enough on its plate without possibly having to support the small country, the Hill reports. He also claimed NATO membership isn't supported by a majority of Montenegro citizens. Paul said being called a traitor for opposing the bill might be  a little over the top.

"(Jun 15, 2016  6:01 PM CDT) The state of Louisiana's refusal to install air conditioning on death row has already cost taxpayers at least $1,067,000 in expenses fighting a lawsuit filed on behalf of three inmates with medical problems, according to records obtained by the AP. Meanwhile the state could spend roughly the same money—and possibly much less—on an AC system that would satisfy a federal judge's order to protect death row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. This tally, based on state documents provided in response to the AP's public records requests, is the first public accounting of how much the case has cost taxpayers. Most of the money has gone to private attorneys on opposing sides of the case, which US District Judge Brian Jackson says could ultimately cost many more millions of dollars, and expert witnesses and state contractors also have received tens of thousands of dollars. More than two years have passed since Jackson ruled Louisiana imposes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment once the heat index exceeds 88 degrees. The index routinely crosses that threshold on death row, occasionally exceeding 100 degrees; plaintiff James Magee said it's like a  sauna  in the morning and an  oven  in the afternoon. A plaintiffs' expert estimated it would cost about $225,000—sans engineering fees or operating costs—to install AC on death row's six tiers. A state engineer in 2014 said nine AC units could cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that holds death row, with a state attorney saying each unit would cost  several thousand dollars.  State attorneys argue installing AC would spawn more suits from prisoners nationwide demanding cooler cells. Jackson is set to hear testimony Wednesday on whether the state's current heat remediation measures—one cold shower a day, ice chests in the cells, and fans outside—are adequately protecting the plaintiffs as Louisiana's sweltering summer approaches.",La.

The staggering figure from a first-ever Justice Department study highlights the need to strengthen laws and enforcement, especially with technology now making it easier for stalkers to terrorize victims and disrupt their lives. In Illinois, for example, where a 43-year-old was gunned down by a stalker last year, laws make prosecution difficult; protection orders are issued only if the accused is a former partner or household member.

"(Dec 23, 2015  1:02 PM) 'Tis the season for adorable emergencies. NBC New York reports a 7-year-old New Jersey girl called 911 after unintentionally disturbing her family's Elf on the Shelf. And as any Elf on the Shelf owner knows, Elves on the Shelf only have one rule:  Please do not touch me. My magic might go, and Santa won't hear all I've seen or I know.  Well, little Isabelle LaPeruta (also reported as Isabella) didn't have a choice when she threw a ball in the house and turned hers into an Elf on the Floor. One police officer would later say Isabelle was terrified she was  going to ruin Christmas.  So Isabelle called 911. Isabelle begged the 911 operator not to send anyone to her Old Bridge home—she said she was trying to call her dad to tell him what happened—but police are required to respond to every 911 call, NBC reports. An officer arrived and attempted to comfort the crying girl. Isabelle's mom woke up from a nap to find her  hysterical  and  panicking  daughter trying to get rid of the officer.  I didn't want to get in trouble,  Isabelle later explained to NBC. Eventually she realized Santa knew she wasn't  going to do that again  and Christmas was saved.  Isabella apologized,  the officer informed his precinct.  She touched the Elf on a Shelf. She won't call 911 again.",'Panicking' Girl Calls 911 Over Elf on the Shelf

"(May 23, 2017  4:53 PM CDT) Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain's threat level from terrorism has been raised to critical—meaning an attack may be imminent, the AP reports. It's the first time the threat level has been at this level in more than 10 years, CNN reports. May says Salman Abadi, the suicide bomber who killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester, may have been part of a bigger network. She says Abadi was born and raised in Britain. The level previously stood at the second-highest rung of  severe  for several years. May says critical status means armed soldiers may be deployed instead of police at public events such as concerts and sports matches. May says raising the country's terror threat level and deploying soldiers to patrol key sites is a  proportionate and sensible response  to the suicide bombing. May says Tuesday that the  callous and the cowardly  Monday attack justified rolling out the security measures included in a plan the government calls Operation Temperer. May says the measures include replacing police officers who now guard  key sites  with members of the military operating under police command. She says the move  will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations.",UK Raises Threat Level to 'Critical' for 1st Time in Decade

"(Sep 15, 2015  12:00 PM CDT) Bernie Sanders' populist message has him surging in the polls, but his vision comes at a price: $18 trillion over a decade, to be specific, according to the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper crunched the numbers on his various proposals to arrive at that eye-popping total, one that would amount to the  largest peacetime expansion of government in modern American history,  writes reporter Laura Meckler. The biggest chunk of the total, about $15 trillion, is associated with Sanders' plan to expand Medicare to all Americans. Other big-ticket items include $1 trillion in spending on roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects, and $750 billion for tuition-free public colleges. (Update: A Washington Post analysis of the Journal story makes the case that the $18 trillion figure is grossly misleading. For one thing, that $15 trillion estimate for health care reform is based not on Sanders' figures but on the cost of a similar bill currently in Congress. Still, the Journal finds that it's not just conservatives wary of Sanders' initiatives.  We are not a country that has limitless resources,  says Jim Kessler of the Democratic think tank Third Way.  You need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn’t.  To help pay for it, Sanders has so far pitched tax increases, mostly on the wealthy, that would bring in $6.5 trillion over a decade. More tax proposals on the way. His  agenda does cost money,  acknowledges Sanders' policy director. But  if you look at the problems that are out there, it’s very reasonable.  Along those lines, the Post adds that  while Sanders does want to spend significant amounts of money, almost all of it is on things we’re already paying for; he just wants to change how we pay for them.  A blogger at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has a different mindset, writing that despite all the attention paid to Donald Trump, the Journal story shows that Sanders is  the most radical candidate  in the race.",WSJ: Cost of Bernie Sanders' Agenda: $18T

"(Dec 18, 2018  4:47 PM) Alton Thacker's toy factory made its millionth toy car this year—and it has given away every single one of those cars. Tiny Tim's Toy Foundation, founded more than a decade ago in Utah, produces and distributes small wooden cars to children in need around the world. Some of those kids are sick in hospitals, others are living in a tough neighborhood, still others are impoverished in a developing country, but they all react similarly when given the wooden toys:  Kids will drop to the floor and start ‘driving’ them on the concrete, the tile, the dirt,  a retired teacher who drives 60 miles round-trip once a week to volunteer at the factory tells the Washington Post.  The response of pure joy is always the same.  Thacker and his wife, both 83, came up with the idea for the foundation when he and his wife used to dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus and distribute toys to kids in Mexico. The wood is donated and the factory's rent is paid by a benefactor. In addition to volunteers—mostly retirees, with an average age of 80—Thacker and his wife get help producing the cars from groups like churches, Boy Scout troops, and civic organizations. Most of the cars are painted by inmates at a Utah correctional facility, and the volunteer who spoke to the Post says many of them are moved to the point of tears by the chance to help others. The toys are then distributed by charities, churches, children's hospitals, and even long-haul truckers who stop by the factory to pick up a box, dropping off its contents along their routes. Thacker tells the Post he and his wife  both knew the important role toys played in helping little minds to grow. ...

"(Feb 4, 2016  8:13 AM) A US National Academy of Medicine committee said Wednesday the FDA should approve clinical trials for three-parent fertilization in human embryos—with some caveats, Nature reports. In its report, the committee recommended such trials be limited to women at risk of passing along  serious mitochondrial disease  to their kids, and it wants the mitochondrial replacement techniques, or MRT, limited to male embryos only initially. That's because mitochondria is inherited from the mother, and such a restriction would confine the modified mitochondria to one generation.  We concluded that the most germane issues could be avoided if the use of these techniques were restricted by certain conditions, rather than prohibiting them altogether,  committee chair Jeffrey Kahn says in a press release. How the process would work: We have two types of DNA—nuclear DNA, which passes on genetic traits, and mitochondrial DNA. During MRT, a woman with mitochondrial DNA disease would have her nuclear DNA transferred to the nuclear DNA-free eggs of a woman whose mitochondrial DNA is just fine. This would result in three parents, with nuclear DNA from one man and one woman and mitochondrial DNA from another woman. But despite the committee's recommendation, there's still one major hitch: The federal 2016 spending bill currently in effect prohibits the FDA from greenlighting the implantation of modified embryos into women.  The future seems very hazy compared to a few months ago,  a reproductive-biology specialist who's been pushing for such trials tells Nature.",US Panel: OK to Make 3-Parent Embryos —Male Ones
"(Mar 16, 2016  7:52 AM CDT) A new study on the Zika virus may or may not allay pregnant women's fears: Researchers in French Polynesia have strengthened the link between Zika and microcephaly, though they say just one in 100 pregnant women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy developed a fetus with an abnormally small brain or head. The rate—based on an outbreak from October 2013 to April 2014 during which 66% of the population was infected— means you have a 99% chance of having a normal baby,  an expert says, per the New York Times. That's remarkable considering a child born to a woman with rubella in early pregnancy has a 50% risk of birth defects, per the Guardian. However, researchers caution that the rate of microcephaly tied to Zika may vary greatly depending on the outbreak and location. Researchers identified eight babies born with microcephaly from September 2013 to July 2015. Previously, about two cases per 10,000 newborns was the norm. Though the mothers weren't tested for Zika, seven cases were discovered around the end of the outbreak between March and July 2014 and  such temporal clustering strongly supports the proposed association  between Zika and microcephaly, researchers say.  It's still a large public health problem,  a researcher notes.  Severely small heads is only 'the tip of the iceberg,' as many other birth defects are now studied as potentially correlated with Zika's infection, too, increasing the burden of disability and devastation that these babies could be facing, if they survive,  a doctor adds, per Live Science.

Hernandez took all the photos of Steven, even an ultrasound image, that could be used to identify him; Mancia had to contact family in El Salvador to get the sole picture of her son she's treasured all the years since. She reported the kidnapping to the San Bernardino County sheriff's office, but over the years, she tried to wrap her head around the thought that she might never see him again. Then, last week, detectives came to her house:  They told me they found him. They found Steven,  Mancia, 42, tells the San Bernardino Sun. The 22-year-old Steven was found living in Mexico in February after investigators received a tip, the AP reports. Authorities told him they were investigating Hernandez's father, who had recently disappeared himself, and the background information Steven gave them was similar to that of the missing child they were looking for. Eventually, he was positively identified via DNA, and on Thursday, he reunited with his long-lost mom at the San Bernardino DA's office, wiping tears from her face as they hugged.

Jean-Claude Romand of France, whose double life inspired two French films, was released Thursday following an April decision to grant him parole, per AFP. Romand did indeed enroll in medical school in the 1970s but repeated the first-year program for 12 successive years while lying to friends and family, per the BBC. He said he had become a doctor and secured a job with the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. To make his ruse seem legit, Romand drove daily to the border area between France and Switzerland. He would also claim to go on foreign trips, then hide out at highway rest stops. He lived on money from the sale of his student flat, bought for him by his parents, then sought money from loved ones, who believed he had access to investment opportunities as a UN employee. The scheme began to unravel in 1992 as creditors closed in and a family friend checked a WHO staff list. Romand then killed wife Florence with a rolling pin and shot his two children—a daughter, 7, and son, 5—with a rifle on January 9, 1993. The 38-year-old then drove 50 miles to kill his parents and their dog before returning home, downing sleeping pills and starting a fire. He was rescued and convicted of murder in 1996.

"(Feb 16, 2015  2:29 PM) A hacking ring has allegedly stolen up to $1 billion from banks around the world in what appears to be one of the biggest banking breaches known; the Telegraph calls it the  world's biggest bank raid.  The hackers have been active since at least the end of 2013 and infiltrated more than 100 banks in 30 countries, according to Russian security company Kaspersky Lab. After gaining access to banks' computers through phishing schemes and other methods, they lurk for months to learn the banks' systems, taking screen shots and even video of employees using their computers, the company says. Once the hackers become familiar with the banks' operations, they apparently use that knowledge to steal money without raising suspicions. In so doing, they program ATMs to dispense money at specific times or set up fake accounts and transfer money into them. The hackers seem to limit their theft to about $10 million before moving on to another bank, part of the reason why the fraud was not detected earlier, says Kaspersky. The attacks are unusual because they target the banks themselves rather than customers and their account information. Most of the targets have been in Russia, the US, Germany, China, and Ukraine, although the attackers may be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, Kaspersky says. In one case, a bank lost $7.3 million through ATM fraud. In another case, a financial institution lost $10 million by the attackers exploiting its online banking platform.

Anthony Sanborn, 44, had been convicted of killing 16-year-old Jessica Briggs and sentenced to 70 years in prison. At a hearing earlier Thursday, Hope Cady testified that as a troubled 13-year-old she was pressured by police and prosecutors into identifying Sanborn, who was 16 at the time, as the killer.

On a shelf in a hut in Cape Adare sat a  perfectly preserved  fruitcake apparently untouched for more than a century, reports Stuff.co.nz. Made by British label Huntley & Palmers, the fruitcake was hidden inside a  severely corroded  tin taken from the hut as part of a conservation project encompassing several old huts built during a Norwegian expedition in 1899, per AAP. And though its paper had begun to deteriorate, the cake itself looked  like new  and rather tasty. Unfortunately, it didn't smell quite as good, with an odor of  rancid butter,  Lizzie Meek of New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust tells Newshub. The fruitcake was actually one of 1,500 artifacts recovered from the huts. And it wasn't the only food item. There were also  badly deteriorated  meat and fish, sardines, and  rather nice looking  jams, in addition to tools and clothing, Meek says. The fruitcake, however—believed to have been carried to Cape Adare by a member of Robert Falcon Scott's British Antarctic Expedition in 1911—was  quite a surprise,  Meek says.  Most people don't carry a whole fruitcake to Antarctica and not eat it.  Though it's not recommended, you could theoretically taste it if you ever visit Antarctica: Meek says all items found will be returned to the huts.

"(Jul 3, 2011  5:32 PM CDT) A two-year-old Chinese girl left unattended fell 10 stories from her family's apartment window yesterday—and survived after being caught by a woman passing by, state media reported today. The girl, named Zhang Fangyu but known by the nickname Niu Niu, was in the care of her grandmother yesterday afternoon when the older woman left the 10th-floor apartment outside the eastern city of Hangzhou to run an errand. Neighbors saw Niu Niu dangling from the apartment window for several minutes; when the girl fell, Wu Juping  kicked off her high-heeled shoes  and ran to catch the child. A 31-year-old mother, Wu told CCTV that when she saw the hanging girl she thought of her own seven-month-old son, who had once fallen from a high chair and cut his mouth:  I thought to myself 'I should stretch my arms to her. Because I am right here, I must get her.' Then I made it. I caught her in my arms.  The impact broke Wu's left arm and knocked her out, sending her crumbling to the ground; the toddler is in critical condition with internal bleeding and other unspecified injuries.",Toddler Falls 10 Stories—and Woman Catches Her

The number is so high that it could swing election results in key battleground states, Reuters reports. According to the report from left-leaning group Advancement Project: President Obama is leading Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters by quite a large margin, polls show—at least 70% to 30%—an edge that is seen as crucial to an Obama victory in November. Of particular importance is Hispanic turnout in battleground states like Florida, where Hispanic voters make up 27% of all eligible voters.",New Voting Laws May Block 10M Hispanics From Polls
"(Aug 24, 2016  6:06 AM CDT) A 16-year-old South Florida boy has made a miraculous recovery after becoming infected with a rare brain-eating amoeba. Sebastian DeLeon is only the fourth person in the US to survive an infection by the Naegleria fowleri parasite, which he contracted while swimming, Florida Today reports. On Aug. 5, the teen was at an Orlando theme park with his family when he was overcome with headache so excruciating that he  couldn't tolerate people touching him,  said Dr. Humberto Lirian, a critical care pediatrician. Sebastian’s parents took him to Florida Hospital for Children, where Dr. Dennis Hernandez decided not to stop at a migraine diagnosis and took a sample of his spinal fluid—a move that saved the boy’s life. Call it  divine intervention and a gut instinct,  Hernandez said, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Other symptoms can include fever, nausea, and seizures. A lab test revealed the deadly amoeba, which can be tough to spot, and doctors immediately reached out to the maker of a drug recently approved to treat the parasite—the company, Profounda, happens to be based in Orlando. After Profounda got the call, notes the Sentinel,  the drug to treat Sebastian was delivered in 12 minutes.  Miltefosine isn't commonly stocked by hospitals, which cost the life of an 11-year-old Florida boy in 2014, but that may change after Sebastian’s close call. Quick treatment was credited with saving a 12-year-old in Arkansas in 2014. Only three people out of 138 have survived infection, according to the CDC. For the DeLeon family at least, there is a happy ending.  We are so thankful that God has given us the miracle,  said the teen’s mother, Brunilda Gonzalez.

"(Apr 14, 2009  8:27 AM CDT) Retail sales fell unexpectedly in March, delivering a setback to hopes that the economy's steep slide could be bottoming out. The Commerce Department cited a 1.1% drop, the biggest decline in 3 months and a much weaker showing than the 0.3% increase that analysts expected. Falling auto sales led the overall slump in demand. Sales also plunged at clothing stores, appliance outlets, and furniture stores. Meanwhile, wholesale prices dropped sharply last month as the cost of gasoline and other energy plummeted, fresh evidence that inflation appears to pose little threat to the economy. The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, fell by 1.2% in March; analysts expected no change.

That's one of the messages KFC management is banking on to rescue it from fast-food irrelevance, especially after losing major market share to rival Chick-fil-A, the Washington Post reports. The Yum Brands subsidiary is spitting out $185 million to reboot its business, which includes sprucing up some of its 4,300 stores, pushing new Deep South fare, and bringing back in TV ads what a press release calls the  brand's greatest asset : the ever-popular Colonel Sanders, who died in 1980 and hasn't been seen in a KFC ad in two decades.

While the well still needs to be permanently sealed with cement and inspected by state regulators, the announcement by Southern California Gas Co. marked the first time the leak has been under control since it was reported Oct. 23.  We have temporarily controlled the natural gas flow from the leaking well and begun the process of sealing the well and permanently stopping the leak,  Jimmie Cho, a SoCalGas senior vice president, said in a statement. If the plug holds and all goes according to plan to seal the well, the upscale Porter Ranch community in the San Fernando Valley could begin to return to normalcy after schools were closed and about 6,000 families were uprooted as they complained of headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, and other symptoms as an intermittent stench wafted through the area. Public health officials blamed their woes on an odorant added to gas so it can be detected and have said they don't expect long-term health impacts. Some folks have said they don't want to move back, and many are concerned about what the incident has done to the value of their homes.

President Obama is up six percentage points over Mitt Romney in the latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, a small increase from last month when he had a three-point lead. In 12 battleground states, Obama's lead is eight points, the same as last month.  So much has happened, and so little has changed,  said a Democratic pollster. One thing both candidates have in common is that their very negative numbers are both rising. In fact, people say the more they learn about both candidates, the more they don't like either one of them. Obama's favorable/unfavorable ratings are now 49%-43%, down a bit from June's 47%-38%; while Romney's are 35%-40%, a tick better than last month's 33%-39%. But that does give Romney a rare net negative favorable/unfavorable number before the party convention, a feat that no modern GOP candidate has ever had.

Within four seconds of its launch, the weapon was destroyed by authorities due to a problem, Reuters reports; an expert says it was a computer issue. For public safety reasons,  we had to terminate,  says a Pentagon rep.  The weapon exploded during takeoff and fell back down in the range complex,  where it resulted in some damage to the launch area, but no injuries.

Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith says Rogelio Chavez was taken into custody at the house of an associate in San Jose, the AP reports. Video of the scene showed a man in handcuffs being led out of the house by at least six officers. Detectives were trying to search the home of Karla Fernandez when they noticed someone was hiding in the attic and requested backup from the SWAT team, Smith said. A SWAT team shot tear gas canisters into the home at least twice during the standoff. Authorities say Chavez was taken to a hospital because he was suspected of being under the influence of crack cocaine and marijuana. Fernandez, who's on probation, was also arrested and is facing charges of resisting and obstructing an investigation, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and being an accessory to an escaped inmate. The other fugitive, 26-year-old Laron Campbell, was arrested at his sister's home in Antioch late Tuesday. He was tracked to the home on Monday, and authorities with the US Marshals Service and Antioch Police launched a stakeout.

The unidentified suspects in the 29-year-old's death are 18 and 19. A gunman fatally shot McKee during rioting in the city of Londonderry Thursday night in what police are calling a  terrorist act.  She had been standing with other civilians near police vehicles, and authorities suspect the shooter was firing at police. Earlier, they released video of the alleged masked gunman. The unrest in Londonderry revolves around the decades-long unrest in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, and the latest escalation is being linked to tensions over Brexit, reports CNN. The coming of Brexit raises the possibility that hard borders will once again be put in place between Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK, and the rest of Ireland, which is in the European Union. The possibility is inflaming tensions among hard-liners who think Northern Ireland belongs to Ireland and who reject the 1998 Good Friday peace accord in which the Irish Republican Army accepted a political solution to the issue, per the AP.

The triplets, born in October 2016, underwent a set of surgeries at just two months of age in January and are all thriving back at home, apparently not even minding their helmets, which they must wear 23 hours a day for the next six to nine months.  Your skull is made up of plates, it’s not a single bone,  says operating surgeon David Chesler of Stony Brook Children's Hospital. If the plates fuse too early, it can  detrimental to the brain, the vision, the life of the child. It’s not imminently life-threatening, but it can cause real consequences down the road.  It occurs just once in every 2,000 births, but doctors put the odds of it occurring in triplets—particularly a set that isn't identical and thus not prone to the exact same malformations—at one in 500 trillion, reports CBS Local. Mom Amy calls their progress  amazing  and their father, Mike, says that while life with three boys and three cats is  crazy,  he  wouldn't change it for the world.  They say they'd love to have a girl, but aren't planning to try.  With our luck, we would have another set of triplets,  Mike says.

Well, the two Hitachi elevators will cover 95 floors in 43 seconds, Businessweek reports. They'll be housed in the 1,738-foot Guangzhou CTF Finance Center, which is due to open in 2016. According to Hitachi, passengers will have a  comfortable ride.  But  when you're traveling that distance, you're going to get pressures on your ears changing,  an expert tells the BBC. Hitachi says it will adjust air pressure inside the elevator cars accordingly. Meanwhile,  active guide rollers  will deal with vibration and any  minute warping in the guide rails,  the company adds. Brakes will be able to withstand high temperatures. Currently, the world's fastest elevators are in Taiwan's Taipei 101 building; they move at 37.7mph.

The angry 43-page complaint claims that Gore and Hyatt wooed him with promises that he would be his own boss. But then Hyatt began running Olbermann's program as his  personal hobbyhorse,  and  major business errors became commonplace and acceptable,  according to the suit. Two weeks before Countdown began, says the suit, Hyatt threatened to shut it down unless Olbermann reined in his representatives after Hyatt accused Olbermann's manager of leaking contract details to the Hollywood Reporter—triggering claims in the lawsuit that the threat amounted to  blackmail.  Olbermann  deeply regrets his decision to put his trust in Hyatt and Gore,  the suit states. The suit also says Current TV scheduled program guest hosts without Olbermann's approval, and released inaccurate data understating the program's ratings, reports the Los Angeles Times. A Current TV statement calls the suit  false and malicious.  Current TV fired Olbermann for  serial, material breaches of his contract, including the failure to show up at work, sabotaging the network, and attacking Current and its executives,  the statement added.

Kent Conrad told the Washington Post as he headed into a meeting to announce the deal, and Nelson, asked if he was prepared to support it, said,  Yeah.  The breakthrough, which gives Harry Reid the 60 votes he needs to block a GOP filibuster, came after many hours of bargaining over restrictions on abortion coverage and goodies for Nelson's home state of Nebraska. The Nelson amendment on abortion does not forbid insurance plans from covering abortion services, the New York Times reports, but it gives states power to prohibit abortion coverage in the insurance exchanges where the plans would be sold.

"(Nov 13, 2014  10:11 AM) Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is buying Duracell from Procter & Gamble in a deal valued at approximately $3 billion. Berkshire has been a significant P&G shareholder since the consumer products firm acquired Gillette in 2005, but the Duracell acquisition will use nearly all of Berkshire's 52.48 million shares; Buffett has estimated that Berkshire's P&G stake cost it roughly $336 million.  I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,  Buffett said in a statement today. Berkshire already owns a number of well-known consumer brands in its portfolio of more than 80 businesses, including Fruit of the Loom, Geico, Helzberg Diamonds, and half of the HJ Heinz Co. P&G, the world's biggest consumer products maker—its products include Tide and Pampers—has been trimming its product lineup to focus on its top performers. After it finishes jettisoning more than half its brands around the globe over the next year or two, P&G has said it will retain 70 to 80 brands. The company had announced last month that it wanted to make Duracell, which it acquired in 2005, a stand-alone company. P&G will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by Berkshire Hathaway (those shares are currently valued at about $4.7 billion). Offsetting that price, P&G will contribute about $1.7 billion to the Duracell business before the deal closes.

Four Houston officers were found to have falsely reported each other as witnesses on tickets they wrote, investigators say. In some cases, one officer allegedly reported another as a witness—when the second cop was elsewhere writing up a ticket of his own, KHOU reported last month. Why would they do this? To get paid overtime when they testified about the alleged speeding, KHOU reports. Not all the thousands of tickets are necessarily problematic, but Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland says it's better to dismiss them all than to find someone guilty incorrectly.  If there's any perception that these citations may be tainted or someone questions the legitimacy or credibility of those, it is better to dismiss them,  he says. Three of the officers—John Garcia, Robert Manzanales, and Gregory Rosa—are currently under investigation; the other, Rudolph Farias, killed himself following the emergence of the allegations, KHOU notes.",Police Scandal Leads to 6K Nixed Speeding Tickets

Police say the boy stabbed his sister to death and seriously injured his 56-year-old mother in the Monday afternoon incident. No motive has been given. West Hartford Mayor Shari Cantor says the town is  incredibly brokenhearted,  the Hartford Courant reports.  As mayor this is just the worst nightmare,  she says.  To have a tragedy like this and to lose anybody in your community is very difficult.  The mother has been identified as Janemarie Murphy, a lobbyist well-known and well-liked at the state Capitol. ABC reports that both children were honor students at Sedgwick Middle School. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who knows Murphy, offered his condolences to the family and the town after what he called an  unbelievably heart-wrenching and unthinkable tragedy.  The girl has been identified as 12-year-old Brigid Curtin.

The man's name and hometown have not been released.  We are amazed that he fell from such a high distance and still survived,  says a family statement.  Landing on the car really helped, and we are so thankful for that.  Police say the man was moving equipment on the roof of a bank building in San Francisco's financial district and not on a window-washing platform when he fell Friday morning, crashing against the roof and back window of a sedan. So how did he possibly survive the impact? Physics professor Paul Doherty explains that it took about three seconds for the man, falling at an estimated speed of 60mph, to hit the car, which acted as a big shock absorber.  He crushed the roof in a part where there were no reinforcement pillars and that allowed the roof to collapse more than a foot, maybe even two feet, under him and spread out the impact,  says Doherty.

"(Apr 1, 2020  7:21 AM CDT) Though it may seem the US missed its chance to get ahead of the coronavirus, one prominent name sees glimmers of hope. In a Washington Post op-ed, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates notes that  the choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down, and how many Americans will have to bury a loved one.  First, Gates points out, there's no current consistent approach for getting people to stay home.  The country's leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere,  he writes, adding  any confusion about this point will only extend the economic pain, raise the odds that the virus will return, and cause more deaths.  Second, Gates notes, our testing efforts—both in number of tests available and in how they're administered—need improvement. Self-test swabs that don't expose health care workers, as well as better prioritization on who gets the tests, are just two areas Gates is pushing for. The third bullet point, per Gates:  a data-based approach to developing treatments and a vaccine.  He notes that although scientists are working as fast as they can to develop both,  leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic buying.  Gates says we may very well be able to achieve a vaccine in less than 18 months, but in combination with that, we have to ensure we have enough doses for everyone, and enough facilities to manufacture them. In short, though things look dire and  we still have a long way to go ... I still believe that if we make the right decisions now, informed by science, data, and the experience of medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to work,  Gates writes.

"(Sep 1, 2014  9:39 AM CDT) Gun control advocates may have been thrilled with US sanctions on Russia that banned imports of AK-47s, but they probably didn't count on the huge jump in US sales of the assault rifle that resulted. Gun dealers have run out of inventory after consumers rushed to stockpile Kalashnikov AK-47s when the Obama administration made its sanctions announcement in July, according to the Washington Post. As Fox Business noted in July, the ban doesn't prohibit people who already own a Kalashnikov gun from keeping it or reselling it, according to the Treasury's sanctions FAQ; rather, it's meant to  exacerbate Russia’s economic problems  after its actions in Ukraine. Kalashnikov Concern is banned from importing any of its guns, including the more advanced AK-74, CNN reported in July. While the import stoppage may be hurting Moscow, it has only lit a fire under gun advocates—some have bought up to 10 rifles each as an  investment,  notes the Post—who think the Ukraine crisis is just an excuse for increased gun control. While sales booms such as this are great for firearms dealers, one tells the Post that in the long run, similar bans  might put us out of business.  Another concurs:  A two- or three-month jump in sales, only to have the rest of your lifetime to not have those sales, is kind of stupid,  he says.

Some fraction of Donald Trump's losses can be attributed to depreciation  but  we found most of it was just bad business,  she tweeted.

On Friday, two more exposés on Kelly were published: lengthy pieces in BuzzFeed and the Washington Post. The Post delves into how and why the music industry overlooked allegations against Kelly and speaks to former staffers of his, music industry bigwigs, parents of young women in his entourage, and six women who were once involved with him (two of whom have never spoken out publicly before); BuzzFeed speaks to a woman who says she was in an abusive relationship with Kelly beginning at 17 and the mother of a woman allegedly  brainwashed  by Kelly. The picture painted by the two pieces is bleak: The Post, for example, says Kelly constantly has an entourage of young women (sometimes minors), many of whom believed he would help kickstart careers in the entertainment industry, who are allegedly kept extremely isolated: They hand over phones, leave social media, cut off contact with family and friends, and move in with Kelly, whom they must call  Daddy.  They aren't allowed to look at other men, according to the Post's sources, and must ask permission from Kelly or staffers even to use the restroom; sometimes, forced to stay in a room for hours, this means they urinate into cups.

But though the company holds the most profits offshore of any US company, it's hardly alone: At least 358 American companies hold $2.1 trillion in profits, which would be subject to a 35% corporate tax rate if the funds were to reach the US, according to the review by two left-leaning nonprofits, per Reuters. That means $620 billion could be collected by feds—enough money to eliminate the federal deficit, notes CNBC. Instead, companies move assets to places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where they pay about 6% in taxes. The report finds 60% of companies with tax subsidiaries had at least one in either country, though the Netherlands had the highest number of subsidiaries. Think $620 billion in potential tax gains is high? The actual number is likely much higher. The report notes just 57 companies disclosed how much they would owe if they transferred their offshore holdings back home. As  nearly 72% of the Fortune 500 operate subsidiaries in tax haven jurisdictions as of the end of 2014 … Congress can and should take strong action to prevent corporations from using offshore tax havens, which in turn would restore basic fairness to the tax system, reduce the deficit, and improve the functioning of markets,  the study from Citizens for Tax Justice and the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund found. Just 30 companies account for $1.4 trillion in offshore profits. General Electric was found to hold $119 billion in 18 tax havens, Microsoft has $108.3 billion in five, and Pfizer has $74 billion in 151.",There's $620B in Taxes the US Can't Get Its Hands On
"(May 17, 2018  7:35 PM CDT) An enduring mystery in Azita Milanian’s life was solved Wednesday when she was reunited with 20-year-old Matthew Whitaker, reports the Los Angeles Times. Two decades ago, Milanian went for a jog in the foothills of Altadena, Calif., with her dogs when one of the dogs started scratching at the dirt. Milanian walked over to the dog and saw something that took her breath away: two tiny feet sticking out from a shallow grave. Milanian started to dig and found a 7-pound, 12-ounce newborn wrapped in a blanket, his umbilical cord still attached, barely clinging to life. His body temperature was 80º. She cleared the dirt from his mouth and nose and begged him not to die.  He grabbed my wrist and stopped crying,  Milanian told the LA Times in 1998. Milanian called 911 and flagged down a motorist who got help from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The baby was nursed back to health at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and was eventually adopted. Unbeknownst to Milanian, the baby grew into a strapping young man named Matthew Whitaker. Over the years, Milanian has been haunted by the memory of finding the baby and tried repeatedly to locate him. No luck. But years later, a producer for On Air with Ryan Seacrest heard Whitaker’s story, did some detective work, and reunited them 20 years to the day of the rescue. When Milanian saw Whitaker, she burst into tears as he hugged her. That day, Milanian drove Whitaker to the hiking trail where she found him.  This could have been my grave,  Whitaker said as he looked out at the trail. To read the complete story, go here.","She Found an Abandoned Baby. 20 Years Later, He Found Her"

Just ask Emilio Lopez and Orlando Estevez, two Florida businessmen accused of bilking Medicare for $28,600 in penis pumps to combat impotence, even though the supposed patients included women. Yes, Medicare regulators did not even notice they were paying out $395 per penis pump to help Florida ladies battle erectile dysfunction. Sadly, authorities say the penis pump scheme is only the most outrageous of Lopez and Estevez's fraud: case documents detail how Medicare reimbursed their two companies about $735,000 after they submitted $1.9 million in fake claims, reports the Miami Herald, which notes that Miami-Dade has become the capital of Medicare fraud over the last decade.","Medicare Paid Out $29K in Penis Pumps, Many for Girls"

Robert West got suspicious when he went to the dentist and was told his Medicaid benefits had maxed out. He went home, combed through his records, and realized that Maxim Healthcare had billed the government for hundreds of hours of nursing care he never received. He made some phone calls to government agencies and got nowhere, then hired his own lawyer. The result? Maxim just agreed to a $150 million settlement for defrauding not only Medicaid but Veterans Affairs, and West got $15 million of that for his whistleblower's share.

"(Jan 3, 2013  1:07 PM) Scientists have done a sort of  cosmic census,  completing a new study that finds the Milky Way galaxy is home to 100 billion alien planets—and maybe even many more than that.  It's a staggering number, if you think about it,  says the lead author.  Basically there's one of these planets per star.  The researchers figured the estimate by studying Kepler-32, a five-planet system that, they say, is representative of many such systems in the galaxy, Space.com reports. The planets orbit around the most common type of star in the galaxy, and they are similar in size and orbit pattern to other planets spotted orbiting around the same type of star.  This is as close to a Rosetta stone as anything I've seen,  says a co-author.  It's like unlocking a language that we're trying to understand—the language of planet formation.  Scientists only estimated the number of similar planet systems, meaning that their estimate is probably rather conservative; the lead author estimates there could actually be 200 billion planets in the galaxy.",Milky Way: Home to 100B+ Planets
"(Sep 7, 2015  6:32 AM CDT) An already critically endangered species has been driven even further to the brink after an insane population decline compounded by the fact that scientists are at a loss to explain it. Initially, scientists weren’t too perturbed to hear some saigas—a type of antelope that inhabits Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia—were dying off during their calving period in May; some 12,000 died of apparent digestive issues last year after scientists speculated that there was too much greenery, reports Live Science. But suddenly, at least 120,000 animals, or half of Kazakhstan’s population, were dead by June, including a herd of 60,000 saigas felled in four days.  I have worked in veterinary diseases all my career and I have never seen 100% mortality,  an expert tells Nature.  That is extraordinary.  Another adds the  extent  and  speed  of the die-off  has not been observed for any other species...It's really unheard of.  Researchers quickly moved to identify the threat, following what little clues they had: Necropsies and observations showed mothers died first, followed by their calves. But a most mysterious find came next: Scientists found toxins from the usually-harmless Pasteurella and possibly Clostridia bacteria often found in the animals’ bodies were causing extensive bleeding in their organs, per UPI. What had changed in the bacteria to make it suddenly deadly? Apparently, nothing.  There is nothing so special about it. The question is why it developed so rapidly and spread to all the animals,  a researcher says. Experts are continuing to investigate but say the die-off may be another  flash crash  like the 1988 die-off of 400,000 saigas; bacteria may have spread more easily this year via standing water after a wet spring; or the Pasteurella and Clostridia bacteria may have suddenly sprung into unexpected action.

In addition to driver fatigue, the NTSB also notes that Roper was doing 65 in a construction zone, 20mph over the limit, reports AP.  Had the truck driver been traveling at the posted work zone speed limit of 45mph, it could have been stopped before impact,  says NTSB investigator David Rayburn.

"(Nov 24, 2015  11:36 AM) A newly approved drug is being hailed as a major advance in treatment of cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic disease that clogs the lungs with mucus and makes patients struggle to breathe. But it comes with a punishing price tag—about $710 per patient per day. Orkambi—taken as two pills, twice daily—is a combination of two cystic fibrosis drugs that won approval from the FDA in July. Federal law requires Medicaid to cover FDA-approved drugs, and the US government picks up more than half the tab. The treatment takes a bite out of Medicaid programs already facing big budget problems, and a small state like Vermont will be on the hook next year for $3.6 million—nearly 7% of the state's estimated $54 million Medicaid budget deficit—for a drug expected to treat only 40 people. Orkambi's arrival follows on the heels of last year's new hepatitis C drug, Harvoni, which claimed the record for the most expensive drug purchase by Vermont Medicaid. About 70 Medicaid patients received it in Vermont last fiscal year, leaving the state with a bill of nearly $5.9 million, says a Department of Vermont Health Access rep.  States that have small budgets in their Medicaid also can't afford ... to pay for 40 people in their state when they've got many others who need diabetes drugs and whatever other drugs,  says a drug pricing expert.

"(Jan 16, 2018  8:05 AM) It's said to be  exceedingly rare,  but a study in the BMJ Case Reports journal documents the case of a 34-year-old UK man who showed up at a Leicester hospital complaining he was having a hard time swallowing, and that he felt a  popping sensation  in his neck. After some prodding, doctors discovered the man had suppressed a sneeze by pinching his nose and clamping his mouth shut. That ended up rupturing his throat from the force of the stifled sneeze, rendering him voiceless and landing him in the hospital. Anthony Aymat, a London doctor not involved in the study, explains to the AP that sneezes can escape your body at 150mph or so, and that if you try to keep one inside,  it could do a lot of damage and you could end up like the Michelin Man with air trapped in your body.  Although they say a throat rupture like this is rare, the study's researchers elaborate on other potential complications, including a brain aneurysm or eardrum damage, per the Guardian. The University of Texas' Dr. Zi Yang Jiang, who says he sees a couple of sneeze-induced issues each year, tells the AP a collapsed lung is also possible. Doctors used scans to assess this patient and found the popping sound was caused by air bubbles that had formed in his throat tissue and neck.  The whole point of sneezing is to get something out of your body, like viruses and bacteria ... if you stop that, those may end up in the wrong part of the body,  Jiang says. The patient was given antibiotics, fed through a tube, and released a week later, with strict instructions to let future sneezes fly.  The safest thing to do—although it's not socially acceptable—is just to sneeze loud,  Aymat tells the AP.

The Atlantic notes we already knew that this occurred, but that the toll is just now being fully understood: It describes a new study published in the journal Nature as  a kind of autopsy report for the debacle.  A team led by Terry Hughes, the head of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, examined the  catastrophic die-off  more closely to establish links between high levels of heat exposure, the resulting coral bleaching, and how well the coral ultimately withstood it. The upshot isn't good: About a third of the world's largest reef system succumbed to the  mass mortality  between March and November that year, per the Guardian. The Los Angeles Times notes a second heat wave in 2017 exacerbated things, with both events leading to the destruction of about half the Great Barrier Reef's coral. The researchers found that coral in areas where the heat exposure was greatest experienced the biggest die-offs. (Per the New York Times, it only takes a spike of two or three degrees Fahrenheit above normal to decimate the coral.) Another shocker: About half the coral destroyed in 2016 didn't gradually die from starvation, as scientists believed would happen, but instead went south  very quickly  from heat stress, taking only a few weeks to perish. Hughes says he's trying to keep a  glass half full  outlook, noting that the billion corals that did endure are more resilient than their unfortunate counterparts. Still, if we can't keep the heat under control, it's  game over,  he says. (Australia will feel a  profound  impact from this loss.)","In 2 Years, Half the Great Barrier Reef's Coral Was Destroyed"

He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone.  I saw the outlet and ran for it,  he recalls.  That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?'

On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to Gomez and Nancy Pelosi questioning why Gomez hadn't been sworn in yet.  They have no representative to debate and vote in the People’s House on the critical issues facing our country,  the letter said of Gomez's constituents. McCarthy was even more blunt on Wednesday, saying Gomez is  neglecting his job  and should maybe resign to let his constituents elect someone who actually wants to do the work. The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus accused McCarthy of making  an unfounded attack on [Gomez's] character.  Gomez has offered multiple reasons for holding off on his swearing in, the Los Angeles Times reports. First, he said he wanted to wait until his election was certified. But he's also currently a California state assemblyman and was trying to put off giving up that position as long as possible to vote on extending a cap-and-trade program. Gomez says he only agreed to stay for the vote until June 15 but a family issue prevented him from being sworn in last week. The Fourth of July holiday will mean further delays. A senior Democratic aide tells Politico Gomez will finally be sworn in July 11. Two representatives elected after Gomez have already been sworn in. The standard time for the winner of a special election to be sworn in is a week.","3 Weeks After Winning Election, New Congressman Is Still MIA"

"(Aug 27, 2017  5:35 AM CDT) Floyd Mayweather Jr. put on a show in the last fight of his spectacular career. Conor McGregor didn't do so badly, either. Mayweather figured out a 50th opponent Saturday night, letting McGregor have the early rounds before stalking him late and leaving the mixed martial artist defenseless and exhausted on the ropes in the 10th round. It was a smashing end to a career that earned Mayweather more money than any fighter before him—including an estimated $200 million for his last bout, reports the AP.  I think we gave the fans what they wanted to see,  Mayweather said.  I owed them for the (Manny) Pacquiao fight.  Mayweather battered McGregor around the ring in the later rounds, finally stopping him at 1:05 of the 10th with a flurry of punches that forced referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight. Mayweather methodically broke McGregor down after a slow start to score his first real stoppage in nearly a decade. In a fight so intriguing that it cost $10,000 for ringside seats, McGregor turned in a respectable performance for his first fight, but Mayweather's experience and ring savvy paid off.  I was a little fatigued,  he said.  He was composed in there, that's what 50 pro fights can give you.  McGregor's challenge of Mayweather was fueled by social media and turned into a spectacle as the two fighters promoted the bout. It figured to make him $100 million or so, and gave McGregor a name and brand outside of the UFC. Mayweather ran his record to 50-0, surpassing Rocky Marciano's 49-0 record.

But Duranord and Jeanne Veillard of Rockland County, NY, have retained their sense of humor over 82 years of marriage and are inseparable—which may explain why they're about to reach 212 years of age as a combined unit, the Journal News reports. Duranord is turning 108 tomorrow and will have a party at their home with family and friends, and Jeanne will be 105 in May, meaning that  212  will soon need to be adjusted to  213.  And while Rockland County doesn't keep  oldest person  records on file, the Veillards' family (which so far includes 12 grandkids and 14 great-grandkids) believes they're the oldest married couple in the county.  I found him in the street  in Haiti, Jeanne Veillard joked at a family gathering yesterday, per the Journal News. The Veillards were married in 1932, raised five kids, and moved to the US in 1968. Opposites obviously attract: During yesterday's get-together, Duranord animatedly told jokes in his native French Creole, sang songs, and offered at least one attending photographer a slice of cake, while his wife sat quietly next to him patting his hand, the Journal News notes.

"(Dec 8, 2017  6:55 AM) Valdez, Alaska, is among the snowiest places in the US, receiving some 300 inches of snow per year, or a little less than an inch per day on average. But even 10 inches of snow falling in a single hour is unprecedented there. Well, it was until Wednesday. In Thompson Pass, a gap in the Chugach Mountains northeast of town, a record 10 inches of snow fell in 60 minutes, followed by another 5 inches in 30 minutes. Weather historian Christopher Burt of Weather Underground says it's one of the most intense snowfalls on record, just behind the 12 inches of snow that fell on Copenhagen, NY, in a single hour on Dec. 2, 1966, per the Washington Post. The 15 inches to hit the Thompson Pass was only part of the storm's total: Over 12 hours, 40 inches of snow accumulated in the area. Over five days, more than six feet of snow has fallen, with another two feet expected through Friday, reports Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. No strangers to snow, Valdez's 4,000 residents were temporarily trapped when a 200-foot-long avalanche buried the only road in and out of town under 20 feet of snow Wednesday, but the Alaska Department of Transportation says the road was cleared Thursday evening, per the Anchorage Daily News.","In Alaska, an Insane Snowfall in 90 Minutes"
"(Jul 31, 2018  11:47 AM CDT) Keith King says no amount of money could make up for his busted marriage. Nonetheless, a North Carolina judge has ordered his wife's lover to pay him $8.8 million. The decision revolves around an obscure law on the books in six states called  alienation of affection,  reports WSOC. In this case, the 48-year-old King claims he was in a happy marriage with 33-year-old Danielle, whom he wed in 2010, until she began an affair with a man she met on a business trip, reports WRAL and Inside Edition.  I've compared it to like a nuclear bomb going on around my surroundings,  says King, who first got wind of the affair thanks to phone records. That led to a confrontation between King and Francisco Huizar that was recorded, followed by King learning that he could actually sue his romantic rival over all this.  My marriage was murdered,  says King. Last week, a Durham County judge agreed, ordering Huizar to pay $2.2 million in compensatory damages and $6.6 million in punitive damages. The result is unusual, with most of the 200 alienation of affection claims filed in North Carolina each year settled out of court. But this was  a very classic case that just happened to have all of the factors,  King's attorney tells WRAL. Still, some argue there should be no alienation of affection law at all as it's based on the outdated view that a married woman is her husband's property. It's  archaic … and should be stricken,  says Huizar's lawyer, who claims King was controlling of his unhappy wife.  Verdicts like these … remove personal responsibility for a person's own marriage.  Huizar plans to appeal. (A controversial entertainer is familiar with this kind of mess.)","He Slept With Man's Wife, Now Owes Him $8.8M"

The discovery lowers the death toll to 23, state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Director Jimmy Gianato said in a statement. The number of dead includes 20 bodies found and three people who are missing and presumed dead, the AP reports. Details of where the two men were found alive were not immediately released. More heavy rain is forecast Monday for parts of the state.  Everybody's just keeping an eye on the sky  as search and rescue teams continue to check whether everyone is accounted for, West Virginia Emergency Management Agency spokesman Tim Rock said. The National Weather Service warned downpours were possible in many areas already ravaged by flooding, including Kanawha and Nicholas counties. The forecast also included hardest-hit Greenbrier county, where floodwaters have yet to recede.

"(Jun 26, 2015  8:24 AM CDT) The State Department is still poring over 55,000 pages of Hillary Clinton emails, but officials made an important announcement yesterday: She didn't turn over at least 15 work-related emails as requested, the New York Times reports. How the discovery was made: The House committee looking into the Benghazi debacle subpoenaed correspondence from longtime Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal, and the State Department cross-referenced the emails he handed over and the ones Clinton did. It found nine emails Blumenthal had were completely missing from her files, as well as parts of six others. Rep. Trey Gowdy, chair of the Benghazi committee, calls the findings  significant  and  troubling  and says that Blumenthal was passing along  unvetted, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated intelligence to our top diplomat  from a source who reportedly had a financial interest in Libya, reports Fox News. But Clinton aides say she handed over all Blumenthal emails, plus a dozen more that he didn't turn in—and that there's no proof the 15 messages in question were actually sent in the form of an email, as Blumenthal compiled the records he handed over into a Microsoft Word document, the AP reports. Officials say that while some are Libya-related, the Blumenthal messages to Clinton don't directly deal with the 2012 Benghazi attacks: Instead, they discuss topics such as media reports about the death of one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons and the inner workings of Libyan rebels. Gowdy isn’t convinced the messages are moot, however.  This has implications far beyond Libya, Benghazi, and our committee's work,  he said in a statement, per CNN.  This conclusively shows her email arrangement with herself, which was then vetted by her own lawyers, has resulted in an incomplete public record.",State Dept. Says Hillary Didn't Turn Over 15 Emails

It was the largest round of executions in recent memory, and the first since pro-Western Jordan launched a crackdown on Islamic extremists two years ago, after the killing of a captured Jordanian fighter pilot by ISIS, the AP reports. The prisoners were hanged at dawn Saturday at Swaqa Prison, about 47 miles south of the capital, Amman, the spokesman said. Five others were executed for other crimes, including incest.

Lawrence McKinney, 61, was convicted of rape and burglary in 1978 but the conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in 2009 after DNA evidence cleared him of the crime. But despite the evidence, the parole board refused to grant him a complete exoneration, meaning McKinney was unable to seek compensation from the state until Gov. Bill Haslam granted him an executive exoneration in December, citing authorities' finding that McKinney  would not have been prosecuted if the DNA testing results had been available at the time of trial,  Fox 17 reports. On Wednesday, the Tennessee Board of Claims voted unanimously to give McKinney the maximum $1 million compensation for the lost 31 years of his life, the Tennessean reports.

Authorities with the city of South Fulton say it appeared that the Sandtown Middle School students became ill after eating some type of candy Thursday. They say the children experienced shortness of breath and other reactions. City spokeswoman Ashley Minter-Osanyinbi says the students were taken to two local hospitals. Fulton County Schools spokeswoman Susan Romanick says the students were first evaluated by paramedics, and then taken to two Children's Healthcare of Atlanta campuses. Romanick said she didn't know what type of candy and snacks were eaten. She said that question is part of an investigation being done by the school system's police department.

"(Dec 21, 2017  4:41 PM) The wave of sexual misconduct allegations that toppled Hollywood power brokers, politicians, media icons, and many others was the top news story of 2017, according to the AP's annual poll of US editors and news directors. The first AP top-stories poll was conducted in 1936, when editors chose the abdication of Britain's King Edward VIII as the top story. Here are 2017's top 10 stories, in reverse order:  10. Islamic State: After lengthy assaults, an array of forces drove ISIS from its two main strongholds—the city of Mosul in Iraq, and its self-styled capital, Raqqa, in Syria. The defeats left the Islamic State without significant territory in either country, but affiliates elsewhere in the region, particularly in Egypt and Afghanistan, continued to operate. 9. Worldwide terror attacks: The first big terror attack of 2017 came on New Year's Day—a gunman killing 39 at a nightclub in Istanbul. Subsequent targets of global terror included an Ariana Grande concert in England, a bike path in New York City, and the historic La Rambla promenade in Barcelona. In October, a truck bombing in Somalia killed more than 500 people; in November, an attack on a crowded mosque in Egypt killed more than 300.  4. Hurricane onslaught: In a four-week span, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria ravaged Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean islands. Harvey killed more than 80 people in Texas and caused an estimated $150 billion in damage. Irma killed scores of people in the Caribbean and US, including 12 residents of a Florida nursing home that lost its air conditioning. Maria damaged more than 200,000 homes in Puerto Rico, caused lengthy power outages, and prompted an investigation into whether the official death toll of 64 was vastly undercounted. 3. Las Vegas mass shooting: A 64-year-old high-stakes video poker player, after amassing an arsenal of weapons, unleashed a barrage of gunfire from a high-rise casino-hotel that killed 58 people and injured hundreds among a crowd attending an open-air concert along the Las Vegas Strip. Weeks after the massacre, questions about the gunman's motives remained unanswered. 2. Trump-First Year: The controversies started on Inauguration Day, with the new president challenged over his claims on the size of the crowd, and persisted throughout the year. Trump's approval ratings hovered around record-low territory, his base remained fiercely loyal, and his relentless tweeting—often in the early morning hours—provoked a striking mix of outrage, mockery, and grateful enthusiasm. 1. Sexual misconduct: Scandals involving sexual misdeeds by prominent men are nothing new in America, but there's never been anything remotely like the deluge of allegations unleashed this year by women who were emboldened to speak out by the accusers who preceded them. Luminaries toppled from their perches included movie magnate Harvey Weinstein, media stars Bill O'Reilly, Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, and several celebrity chefs and members of Congress.",These Are the 10 Biggest News Stories of the Year

The requirement was added by GOP Rep. Cliff Stearns of Florida as the bill was hotly debated last fall. Responders will be informed that their names, government ID numbers, and other details are being passed to the FBI. One of those who will be getting the letter, former NYPD emergency services officer Glen Klein, says the requirement is  absurd  and he can't see any good reason for the FBI to be screening the cops and firefighters who responded to the attack.

Authorities say 33-year-old Jeremiah Grant was arrested following a pursuit in Franklin County, Maine, around 1:30 this morning; Malachi was found unharmed in the vehicle his father was driving and will be brought back to his mother today. Police say Malachi was at his mother's home in Somersworth when 33-year-old Jeremiah Grant took off with him in a gray 1991 Honda Accord while she was distracted, WMUR reports. An Amber Alert had been issued, and police correctly thought Grant may have gone to Maine, where he's a registered sex offender, CBS Boston reports. Police had believed Grant—who is 6 feet tall, weighs 275 pounds, and has tattoos including the words  Alpha Male  on his neck and  INSANE  on his left forearm—to be a danger both to himself and the boy.  There were comments made during the course of the day that lead us to believe that the child is in danger,  a police spokesman initially told WMUR. Grant was charged as a fugitive from justice, eluding police, reckless conduct, and endangering the welfare of a child, per WCSH. He'll be extradited back to New Hampshire, NECN reports.","Cops Fear For Boy, 1, Kidnapped by 'Unstable' Dad"
"(May 9, 2012  1:27 PM CDT) Retiring this year? You and you significant other will need $240,000 for health care expenses, according to Fidelity Investments' latest annual projection. That's up 4% from last year's $230,000 estimate, which is a typical—and actually fairly modest—increase, BusinessWeek reports. Since 2002's $160,000 estimate, the annual figure has increased an average of 6% per year. The calculation is based on a 65-year-old couple who live until 85 (women) and 82 (men) and are not covered by employer insurance but do have Medicare coverage. And if you think $240,000 is a tough pill to swallow, some bad news: Though the estimate includes premiums, co-payments, deductibles, and prescription costs, should you need to go to a nursing home, that long-term-care cost isn't factored in; neither is dental care.

Low prices and increased natural-gas production in the lower 48 are causing energy companies to reconsider the $30 billion project. Without the revenue-generating pipeline, Alaskans who depend on the state’s dividend checks might soon actually be paying taxes themselves. The state-sponsored pipeline was to funnel gas from large energy concerns in the north of Alaska, but so far no one has signed on.

"(Nov 20, 2016  4:33 PM) Chipotle's chorizo burrito as diet food? If you read the description of the menu item, available since October, you certainly wouldn't think so: It packs chicken, pork sausage, rice, beans, and cheese into a tortilla. Except that same sign also said  300 calories.  And so three customers who bought the burrito in Los Angeles this month are suing. As City News Service reports, one of the men behind the proposed class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the menu item on Nov. 3 thinking it was a 300-calorie dish. David Desmond  felt excessively full and realized that the burrito couldn’t have been just 300 calories  after eating it, per the complaint. LV Anderson does the math at Slate, and reports the true total is closer to 1,050 calories. (That's par for the course at Chipotle, according to this 2015 New York Times article.) The suit would cover  all people who bought food at Chipotle for four years leading up to the filing of the complaint,  even though the chorizo filling is a new menu offering. That's because the plaintiffs are alleging the signage is part of a pattern by the chain of presenting misleading nutritional information. CNBC reports Chipotle didn't respond to its request for comment, but Chipotle did reply to some customers who tweeted their disbelief about the calorie count:  I'm sorry for the confusion, but we'll make things more clear next time. The 300 calories is for the chorizo [alone].  (Here are the six meals with the most calories at McDonald's.)",Customers Suing Chipotle Over '300-Calorie Burrito'
"(Jan 28, 2015  11:04 PM) The investigation into the huge blaze that killed a Maryland couple and their four grandchildren earlier this month has pinned the blame on a major fire hazard right in the middle of the mansion's  Great Room : A 2-month-old, 15-foot Christmas tree. Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say.  The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did,  a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would  without a doubt  have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the Pyles had a tradition of extending Christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree  lit most of the time,  WBAL reports. The final body was removed from the mansion's ruins earlier this week and the families issued a statement thanking the community and first responders, reports the New York Daily News.

Waite—who had been in good health and was still working—was nominated for an Emmy in 1978 for his portrayal of the father in a tight-knit Southern family. In his later years, he appeared on shows including Bones and NCIS. His Waltons co-stars say they are devastated by his death, the AP reports.

"(May 24, 2015  3:47 PM CDT) Juan Pablo Montoya insisted he had the best car in the Team Penske stable—even to his three teammates, who all believed they were legitimate contenders to win the Indianapolis 500. With the same confidence he showed 15 years ago when he routed the field, Montoya sliced his way through the field twice and won his second Indianapolis 500 today.  This is too much,  he said in victory lane, the winner's wreath around his neck and the traditional bottle of milk in his hand. Flanked by his children, he looked everywhere for his wife: It was a far different scene from 2000, when the fearless Colombian was single, childless and using Indy cars as a stepping stone to Formula One. But his career has been a series of ups-and-downs through F1, NASCAR, and finally back to IndyCar with motorsports icon Roger Penske. This victory was almost certainly going to go to a Team Penske or Chip Ganassi Racing driver, which had a combined 9 cars in the field. Proving that Indianapolis is their own personal playground, Penske and Ganassi drivers led the majority of the laps today and turned the final restart with 15 laps to go into a three-car thriller between Penske teammates Montoya and Will Power, and Ganassi driver Scott Dixon. Power finished second and Ganassi drivers Charlie Kimball and Dixon were third and fourth.

Not realizing that his dad, Sanford Harling Jr., who was 58, had jumped out of a second-story window, Sanford Harling III, who was 12, broke free from a family friend and ran in to help him, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.  I’m going to go back in to get my dad because he’s walking with a walker,  he said. That's the last time anyone saw him alive; firefighters found the 12-year-old on the first floor, where he'd died of smoke inhalation and thermal burns in the Feb. 5, 2016 blaze.

The law also gives the Interior Ministry the right to forbid any public meeting of more than 10 people, Reuters reports, and it forbids entirely any protest at a place of worship. If anything, the law has inspired more protests. Muslim Brotherhood supporters in several cities took to the streets today.

The singer-songwriter tells CBS Sunday Morning she will  absolutely  rerecord her songbook after her originals masters were sold to a man she accused of bullying her. In acquiring Big Machine Label Group earlier this year, producer Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings nabbed ownership of the six studio albums Swift released before signing with Universal in November.  My musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it,  claimed Swift, who described  incessant, manipulative bullying  by Braun.

Though executives disputed that account—noting Swift's father, a BMLG shareholder, would've been notified in advance—Swift doubles down in the CBS interview. She says she indeed learned of the sale  when it was online,  per the Hollywood Reporter. It was at that point that fellow singer Kelly Clarkson suggested Swift rerecord her songs  but put brand new art & some kind of incentive so fans will no longer buy the old versions.

The $7.3 billion fund, which opened in 2011 and is set to expire in December 2020, has faced a surge in new claims as it winds down. Pending claims will be paid at 50%, while any claims filed after Feb. 1 will be paid at 30%.  I am painfully aware of the inequity of the situation,  says fund administrator Rupa Bhattacharyya.  But the stark reality of the data leaves me no choice. If there had been a different option available to me, I assure you I would have taken it.  The numbers are pretty dire: The fund has paid out about $5 billion to 21,000 people; another 19,000 claims remain unpaid. A 235% surge in claims since December 2015 isn't necessarily due to a race to cash in before the fund closes, so much as cancer latency periods and what Bhattacharyya says is a lack of  a good estimate of how many potential claimants there are, partly because there's never been a good estimate of how many people were exposed.

"(Feb 22, 2017  1:09 PM) A STAT investigation reveals that more than 370 infants and toddlers got sick after their parents gave them Hyland's teething tablets or gel, a homeopathic remedy the FDA has been warning about for years. Eight children died, though the FDA is still reviewing whether the products are to blame. STAT used a Freedom of Information Act Request to obtain FDA records documenting problems possibly tied to the products from 2006 to 2016, and those documents cast a light on incidents in which babies stopped breathing, had seizures, or worse. The FDA was specifically concerned with the ingredient atropa belladonna—also known as deadly nightshade. Many of the symptoms reported are consistent with belladonna toxicity; though the herb can be used in a diluted form safely, the FDA found  inconsistent  amounts in Hyland's products. The company says that its products are safe and that the FDA has not proven a link between them and the problems.  That doesn’t mean that children don’t have a sensitivity to a product,  says a spokeswoman.  There is a lot of sensitivity on kids’ parts and we have to watch carefully. It’s not something that condemns the entire product line.  It wasn't until 2010 that the FDA issued its first warning about the products, and not until September 2016 did the agency issue a more serious warning, after which Hyland's said it would stop manufacturing the products in question. The FDA doesn't oversee homeopathic products the way it does pharmaceutical products; the agency is only tasked with determining whether homeopathic products are unsafe after they're on the market. In response to the Hyland's controversy, a congresswoman has introduced a bill that would give the FDA authority to recall homeopathic products.

Presley—who is reportedly $16 million in debt—argues her fortune was lost because Barry Siegel failed to alert her to inappropriate spending (on expensive homes, mainly) and made a bad investment, reports TMZ. After selling 85% of Presley's shares in Elvis Presley Enterprises for $100 million in 2005, Siegel invested in Core Entertainment, the parent company of American Idol, according to Presley. When the company went bankrupt more than a decade later, Presley says she lost $24.5 million. In a countersuit, Siegel tells a very different story. The 2005 sale of Presley's shares  cleared up over $20 million in debts Lisa had incurred and netted her over $40 million cash and a multi-million dollar income stream, most of which she managed to squander in the ensuing years,  Siegel's attorney says, per the New York Daily News. She  refused to listen to the warnings of her most trusted advisers and her family  and eventually stopped paying Siegel, according to the suit. She is  looking to blame others  but  has only herself to blame for her financial and personal misfortunes,  it adds.

Besides, Facebook may have undershot the mark—another offer reportedly in the work from China's Tencent Holdings values Snapchat at $4 billion, notes the Journal. Snapchat's niche is that it allows users to send photos and messages that soon self-destruct. (Though there's some doubt about that.)

"(Aug 26, 2020  2:28 PM CDT) The man who gunned down John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment in 1980 was denied parole for an 11th time, state corrections officials said Wednesday. Officials said Mark David Chapman was denied after being interviewed by a parole board Aug. 19, the AP reports. Chapman, 65, is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Wende Correctional Facility, east of Buffalo. Chapman shot and killed the former Beatle on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, hours after Lennon autographed an album for him. He has said previously that he feels  more and more shame  every year for the crime.  I was too far in,  Chapman told a parole board in 2018.  I do remember having the thought of, ‘Hey, you have got the album now. Look at this, he signed it, just go home.' But there was no way I was just going to go home.

"(Jul 9, 2014  4:14 AM CDT) Despite all the warnings—and all the attention the Cooper Harris case in Georgia has received—yet another child has died in a hot car, at least the 16th so far this year. At a press conference yesterday, police in Ridgefield, Conn., released few details but said they were notified Monday evening of the death of a 15-month-old boy who was  left unattended inside a parked vehicle for an extended period of time,  reports the Ridgefield Press. Sources tell WTNH that the boy's father discovered him in the car after forgetting to drop him at day care. Police have not said whether charges will be filed. In Connecticut alone, six children have been reportedly left in cars so far this month and police warn that doing so can result in felony charges, the New Haven Register reports. A Yale School of Medicine professor of pediatrics says the inside of a car can reach 120 degrees in summer and it is never safe to leave a child in the car.  People think they're just going to be a few minutes and they get distracted. Then they come back to tragedy,  he says.  The message should be to never leave your child in the car, not even for a minute.

"(Jul 14, 2017  7:13 AM CDT) Millions of Americans who rely on Social Security can expect to see their biggest pay increase in years in January, per projections released Thursday by the program's trustees, the AP reports. The increase is projected to be just 2.2%, or about $28 a month for the average recipient. For context, this year Social Security recipients saw an increase of 0.3%, after getting nothing in 2016. Some good news for seniors: The trustees project Medicare Part B premiums will stay unchanged next year. Most beneficiaries pay $134 a month, though retirees with higher incomes pay more. Both Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment and Medicare Part B premiums will be announced in the fall. More than 61 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses, and surviving children receive Social Security benefits, with an average monthly payment of $1,253. Medicare provides health insurance to about 58 million people. Unless Congress acts, the trust funds that support Social Security are estimated to run dry in 2034, the same as last year's projection. Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care is projected to be depleted in 2029, a year later than last year's forecast. Over the past decade, Social Security and Medicare made up about 40% of federal spending, excluding interest on the debt; 50 years ago, the figure was 16%. The programs are expanding in part because the US is growing older: In 1960, there were 5.1 workers for each person getting Social Security benefits; today, there are about 2.8 workers for each beneficiary.",Social Security Recipients Projected to Get 2.2% Raise
"(Jan 5, 2017  7:33 AM) A pregnant Alabama woman who suffered a miscarriage at six weeks can sue her doctor for wrongful death, the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled, with judges citing a 2009 state law making it a crime to kill or harm  an unborn child in utero at any stage of development.  Physicians who make mistakes are usually protected from civil suits, and a lower court in August dismissed the wrongful death portion of Kimberly Stinnett's claim. But the high court overruled that last week in a unanimous decision that  reaffirms the principle that unborn children are protected by Alabama's wrongful-death statute from the moment life begins,  writes Judge Tom Parker, per AL.com. The ruling is a swipe at Roe v. Wade, which Parker has previously called  incoherent  because  life begins at conception.  The case goes back to May 2012, when Stinnett sought treatment for abdominal cramps and fever. An ER obstetrician who treated her suspected an ectopic pregnancy and performed a dilation and curettage, AL.com reports, followed by an injection of a drug intended to stop the pregnancy. The Helena woman had a history of two miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy. A follow-up ultrasound by Stinnett's regular OB-GYN showed the pregnancy was uterine but failing, possibly because of the injection. In June, Stinnett miscarried and filed a civil lawsuit against the doctor who first treated her. ProPublica has written that Parker's writings pose  the biggest threat to abortion in a generation,  but the ruling was cheered by the chair of Liberty Counsel  for defending the legal rights of the unborn as clearly stated in Alabama law.

"(Mar 17, 2016  9:34 AM CDT) More than a dozen US military personnel have been disciplined, but face no criminal charges, for errors that led to the aerial attack on a civilian hospital that killed 42 people in northern Afghanistan last year, say US defense officials speaking anonymously. Per the AP, the officials say the disciplinary process is nearly complete and is derived from a military investigation of the Oct. 3, 2015, attack on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz by a US Air Force special ops AC-130 gunship, one of the most lethal in the US arsenal. The punishments, which have not been publicly announced, are largely administrative. Some actions, such as letters of reprimand, are enough to effectively end chances for further promotion; the military has previously said some personnel were suspended from their duties. The disciplined include both officers and enlisted personnel, but none are generals. The attack, which the medical charity has called  relentless and brutal,  was unleashed as US military advisers were helping Afghan forces retake Kunduz from the Taliban. The US military's outline of what happened: The crew of the AC-130 had been dispatched to hit a Taliban command center in a different building, 450 yards away from the hospital. However, hampered by targeting sensor issues, the crew relied on a physical description that led them to begin firing at the hospital, though they saw no hostile activity there. A separate US report obtained last fall by the AP said the AC-130 fired 211 shells at the hospital over 29 minutes before commanders realized the mistake. Army Gen. John Campbell, the top US commander in Afghanistan at the time, has called it a  tragic but avoidable accident caused primarily by human error.  A DWB rep says the charity won't comment on disciplinary actions until the Pentagon communicates its decisions directly to the group or makes a public announcement.",US Disciplines at Least 12 for Airstrike on Hospital
"(Apr 24, 2013  1:39 PM CDT) The Earned Income Tax Credit is that rare IRS feature popular with politicians, economists, and especially with the low-income families it helps, notes the Hill. No wonder: Turns out, the IRS is overly generous with the credit. An audit shows that it distributed between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion in improper EITC refunds last year. That accounts for up to 25% of all such refunds. And it's no fluke: That amount is actually a marked improvement from previous years, reports the Washington Post. One of the big problems apparently is that rules surrounding the credit are so confusing that even professional tax preparers get bamboozled. Nor does it help that families might be eligible one year but not the next. Whatever the causes, the IRS is in violation of a 2010 law requiring that improper payments be reduced to a rate of 10% or lower.

Phillip Fleitz, 31, of Indianapolis, was handcuffed and ordered Monday to immediately begin serving the sentence, the AP reports. Fleitz's two co-defendants previously received probation for their roles, and a defense attorney argued Fleitz should receive a similar sentence. But the judge agreed with US Attorney Jimmy Kitchen, who said:  Fleitz was the architect. It was his idea. He was the first to do it  and enlisted the others.  This was a sophisticated and serious scheme,  US District Judge Maurice Cohill Jr. said in imposing the sentence. From September 2011 to February 2013, Fleitz and two others earned between $2,000 to $3,000 weekly by conspiring to violate a 2003 law designed to protect cellphone and computer users from unwanted marketing and porn emails and text messages. The computer and text-message spam included Internet links. Those who received the text messages were told they had won Best Buy gift cards that could be accessed by clicking the links.

"(Jan 11, 2017  2:07 PM) Six high-level Volkswagen employees have been indicted by a grand jury in the company's diesel emissions cheating scandal, as the company admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay a record $4.3 billion penalty, the AP reports. The federal indictments and plea deal were announced Wednesday by the Justice Department in Washington involving the pollution violation and an elaborate and wide-ranging scheme to cover it up. It's the largest penalty ever levied by the government against an automaker. The deal also requires VW to cooperate in an ongoing probe that could lead to the arrest of more employees. At a press conference Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said  Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied.  VW installed software into diesel engines on some vehicles that allowed the engines to turn on pollution controls during government tests and switch them off in real-world driving. The software, called a  defeat device  because it defeated the emissions controls, improved engine performance but spewed out harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times above the legal limit. Regulators confronted VW employees about the use of the software in the summer of 2015. Volkswagen at first denied using the defeat device, but finally admitted to it in September of that year.

Neither does anybody else at the moment, which means the convention is facing a major funding gap, according Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee chief Ed Rendell. The former Pennsylvania governor says the July convention hasn't received any money from the city of Philadelphia or the federal government, the Hill reports. He tells BuzzFeed—where sources estimate the shortfall is closer to $16 million—that the rise of Donald Trump is another reason for the lack of funds, because companies that usually donate to both conventions are shunning the GOP convention because of Trump, and they don't want to appear biased by only donating to the DNC.  We’ve had three blows,  Rendell quips.  The fed, the city, and the Trumpster.  He says it's a  heavy lift,  but he is confident that all $64 million needed to hold the convention will be raised by the end of July.

The 3,300-year old mask, whose beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued on with epoxy in 2014, was scratched and damaged as a result of the amateur repair job, prosecutors said in a statement, which implicated the then-head of the Egyptian Museum and the chief of the restoration department.

The AG's office says Manhattan restaurant Per Se, which charges $310 for its  tasting menu,  slapped a 20%  service charge  on the bills of private-dining client customers and, in violation of state law, used that money for general operational costs instead of giving it directly to the servers, the New York Daily News reports. The restaurant was also fined $100,000 and will be required to step up compliance with labor laws, reports the New York Times. The settlement ensures that servers  will not continue to be cheated out of their hard-earned tips—tips that customers intended for them,  Schneiderman said. In a statement to CNBC, the restaurant says the failure to pay the charge to servers was an oversight after state regulations on service charges changed in 2011.

"(Aug 22, 2013  4:10 PM CDT) A Chicago woman has agreed to pay the city $4,500 in overdue parking tickets, which seems like a princely sum until you learn the original bill was $106,000, reports the Chicago Tribune. Jennifer Fitzgerald reached the settlement with the city this month. How on earth did the fees get so high? It seems an ex-boyfriend abandoned a car registered in her name in the employee lot of O'Hare airport. There it sat for nearly three years as police piled on ticket after ticket, 678 in all. Only then was it towed. Fitzgerald, overwhelmed by the mounting violation notices, finally got some legal help and filed suit against the city to dispute the six-figure bill, reports DNAInfo. She argued that she didn't know the car was registered in her name—her ex had bought it from her uncle for $600—and wondered why the police didn't tow the car far earlier than it did. Under the $4,500 settlement, her ex-boyfriend will fork over $1,600, and Fitzgerald will pay off the remaining balance in monthly installments of $78.

The $2.3 billion all-cash deal includes $2 billion for the team, and $150 million for a joint venture on land surrounding Dodger Stadium, reports the New York Times. The Johnson team's bid beat out two others, including one from St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke. The deal—which still needs to be approved by the judge overseeing the Dodgers' bankruptcy—is being funded by financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, whose chief executive will become the team's controlling owner. Former Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals president Stan Kasten is expected to take over the day-to-day running of the team.

"(Sep 9, 2020  8:27 AM CDT) The Trump administration is pulling nearly half of its troops out of Iraq. The US commander in the Middle East said Wednesday that troops would be reduced this month from 5,200 to 3,000—about the number that were in the country in 2015, during the early phase of a campaign against the Islamic State, per the New York Times.  This reduced footprint allows us to continue advising and assisting our Iraqi partners in rooting out the final remnants of ISIS in Iraq and ensuring its enduring defeat,  Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of US Central Command, said from Iraq, citing  our confidence in the Iraqi security forces' increased ability to operate independently.  A senior administration official had tipped reporters off on Tuesday night, reports the AP. The official said the administration would also be announcing the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in the coming days. The 8,600 troops there are expected to be reduced to under 5,000, per ABC News. President Trump made a 2016 campaign promise to withdraw the US from  endless wars.

"(Jul 5, 2012  6:08 AM CDT) With would-be homebuyers continuing to sit on the sidelines, rental vacancies dropped to a 10-year low last quarter, driving up rental prices to record levels around the United States, reports the Wall Street Journal. Rental prices have reached record highs in 74 of 82 markets measured by real estate tracking firm Reis. The biggest climb last quarter came from New York City, where average rents jumped 1.7% to a hefty $2,935 per month.  The market is in a very tight position,  Reis said in a research report.  There is a paucity of available units.  Nationwide, rental vacancy rates are just 4.7%—only the third quarter in 30 years they have been below 5%—down significantly from 8% in 2009, around the worst part of the economic downturn. But with people worried about job security, tighter lending standards, and wariness over long-term housing prices, rental demand is expanded to stay strong, pushing rents ever higher. The one wildcard, however, is new apartment construction—builders are racing to begin 235,000 units this year, then 285,000 in 2013, and 320,000 in 2014. A flood of new units could drive rents back down.","Rents Hit Record Highs, Vacancies at 10-Year Lows"

The boy, now 15 years old, was a third-grader when police accused him of using a .22-caliber rifle to shoot his father and his father's friend as they returned home from work in 2008. No exact motive was revealed, although the boy referred to spankings in discussions with child welfare investigators. The boy pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of Tim Romans, 39, and prosecutors dropped a premeditated murder charge in his 29-year-old father's death in exchange for the plea. The plea deal called for the boy to be sent to treatment facilities and undergo intensive probation until he's 18. His latest evaluations show he doesn't pose a threat to himself or others, allowing him to join a regular classroom and move to a foster home that's more like a family setting, his attorney says.  He's not just a teenager. He's the teenager who murdered his father, so that puts him in a special category of scrutiny,  the attorney says. The boy's family on his father's side routinely attends court hearings and visits him at the treatment facility, but his mother has been in and out of his life, and a judge recently ordered her to explain why she hasn't been turning over his Social Security payments to help offset the cost of treatment.",Boy Who Murdered at Age 8 Can Go Back to School
"(May 11, 2018  11:40 AM CDT) Hoping to cripple organized crime and tamp down on tax evasion and money laundering, Australia has announced its latest tactic: not allowing cash purchases over $7,500 for goods and services. The West Australian reports the new rule—which will require consumers to use a check or electronic service such as a debit or credit card if a purchase goes over that amount—will take effect in July 2019. Exempt from the mandate will be transactions with financial institutions and those taking place between consumers for non-business-related purposes. The Guardian notes that the measure is part of the government's attempts to tackle the country's so-called  black economy.   This will be bad news for criminal gangs, terrorists, and those who are just trying to cheat on their tax,  said Treasurer Scott Morrison, per Gizmodo. It may also be bad news for Australian small-business owners who rely on larger cash transactions.  It's going to screw me—95% of my business is cash collections,  Paul Thomas tells News.com.au. Thomas, who runs a security company specializing in armored cars and cash in transit, says the new rule is unnecessary, as there's a government watchdog already in place to go after money launderers. Others aren't as concerned, telling the Australian Financial Review the $7,500 limit actually won't be that hard to circumvent: Some say one could simply make a series of smaller payments rather than one big one, while others note the feds won't be able to keep track of such things anyway unless they put a high-tech monitoring system in place.",Australia Outlaws Cash for Purchases Over $7.5K
"(Apr 14, 2017  5:34 PM CDT) Delta is letting employees offer customers almost $10,000 in compensation to give up seats on overbooked flights, hoping to avoid an uproar like the one that erupted at United after a passenger was dragged off a jet. In an internal memo obtained Friday by the AP, Delta Air Lines said gate agents can offer up to $2,000, up from a previous maximum of $800, and supervisors can offer up to $9,950, up from $1,350. United is reviewing its own policies, including incentives for customers, and will announce any actions by April 30, a spokesperson said. The airline would not disclose its current compensation limit. Other airlines did not immediately comment on whether they would raise their ceiling. Ben Schlappig, a travel blogger who first wrote about the Delta compensation increase, said it shows Delta is trying to reduce forced bumping. He said he couldn't imagine many situations in which people wouldn't jump at nearly $10,000. Delta no doubt hopes that gate agents and their supervisors won't need to make maximum offers, and the financial cost to the airline is likely to be limited. If Delta paid $9,950 to every person it bumped involuntarily last year, that would total $12 million. Delta earned nearly $4.4 billion. After the incident last Sunday, critics questioned why United didn't offer more when no passengers accepted the airline's $800 offer for volunteers to give up their seats.  If you offer enough money, even the guy going to a funeral will sell his seat,  said a retired United pilot.",One Airline Will Now Offer Up to $10K to Bump Flyers

Boaters off Long Island and Connecticut have been capturing images of belugas, humpbacks, and at least one minke starting in May, when three belugas were seen near Fairfield, Conn. But while the creatures provide perfect photo ops (especially breaching humpbacks), NOAA warns people to keep their distance, the AP notes. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, only one boat can come within 300 feet of a whale, and even then only for 15 minutes, NBC Connecticut reports; it also must reduce speed and tell other boats about the sighting. (An  Ocean Etiquette  guide by NOAA Fisheries offers more tips. The biggest question, though, has yet to be definitively answered: Why did the whales return to the Sound after such a long break? Experts believe baitfish-harvesting restrictions and less rainfall (which reduces polluted runoff from entering the waters) may have drawn the whales back, per the AP. The whale expert cited in the Hour adds that a whale who's hurt or sick may also sometimes enter strange waters. Whatever the reasons, local boaters are thrilled.  I was having heart palpitations I was so excited,  one tells the AP, while another says he was double-teamed off Stamford, Conn.:  I know for certain that there was more than one whale because the breaching one started to scare me and breached behind the boat while the other whale was in front.

"(Mar 15, 2012  4:53 PM CDT) Why are we fat? It's just something in the air, researchers say—namely carbon dioxide. A Danish researcher found that subjects' weight gain over two decades matched the increase in carbon dioxide over the same period, the Daily Mail reports. What's more, between 1986 and 2010, American obesity increased the most on the East Coast, which has the highest levels of CO2. The researcher speculates that carbon dioxide affects certain hormones in the brain that dictate how much food we eat and energy we expend. To test the theory, researchers put six men into different climate-controlled rooms; some were exposed to extra carbon dioxide. Afterward, the men were asked to eat as much as they wanted. Those who'd experienced the higher CO2 ate 6% more than their peers. The Mail offers an addendum to all this: Researchers in Scotland say that if every overweight person on the planet shed 22 pounds, it would cut CO2 emissions by some 50 metric tons, or 0.2% of global emissions in 2007.

"(Oct 31, 2014  7:43 AM CDT) Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned—especially one in an arranged marriage in which her husband has rejected her. An Indian bride filed charges in Bangalore this month, claiming that not only was her husband cheating on her, but that he violated a colonial-era law that bans  carnal intercourse against the order of nature with a man, woman, or animal,  the New York Times reports. The activity in question was her husband having sexual relations with another man—and she had the footage to prove it. The woman knew something was wrong right after their nuptials last November, One India reports: Her husband, a software engineer, wouldn't touch her; when she complained to his parents, they became  hostile,  the Times notes. The wife suspected either impotence (he refused to see a doctor) or adultery. The camera she set up in their home recorded him having a sexual encounter with a man—a violation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. He was arrested. Not many people have been prosecuted under this 1861 law, but conviction could mean life in jail; meanwhile, a  lighter  charge of simple adultery would only result in a max of five years in jail, India's Telegraph reports. This case has reinvigorated the debate not only about the continued stigma against homosexuality (a lower court in 2009 legalized gay sex by striking down the colonial-era law; last December the Supreme Court reinstated it), but also about arranged marriage itself.

Her former business manager to the stars. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Morissette says she fired Jonathan Schwartz of GSO Business Management—whose clients have reportedly included Beyonce and Mariah Carey—in March and learned shortly after that he had taken $4.7 million from her accounts without permission from 2010 to 2014. Schwartz told her new manager that Morissette  spends a lot of cash so I get large amounts from the bank, and keep the money in my safe  for when she needs it, the complaint reads. But after Morissette disputed that, she says Schwartz claimed she put the money into illegal marijuana grow-ops, per Courthouse News. Schwartz also let Morissette transfer $8 million out of her investment accounts and didn't tell her she  dipped into her savings,  the suit alleges, per the Wall Street Journal.

Everybody here is pretty shaken up by it,  animal care director Jamie Dorgan tells CBC News. The penguins were being kept in a holding area this week while their habitat at the Canadian zoo was under renovation, the Guardian reports. According to the New York Daily News, it's unclear what happened to the penguins, who were between 7 and 8 months old and free of infections.  It’s a very odd situation, very odd circumstances, and nothing we’ve ever encountered before,  Dorgan tells the Guardian. A biology professor says penguins drowning is  a pretty rare event,  but the zoo believes the animals—22 in all—may have been spooked by something during the night, panicked, and tried to jump into the pool at once, causing seven to drown. The remaining 15 appear to be fine, though they are being kept away from the pools at night as a precaution. The Calgary Zoo has had its share of animal mishaps. In February, an otter drowned after getting tangled in a pair of pants given to it as a present by a zookeeper.

Eleven shotgun pellets were removed from Arbery's chest, while 13 exited his back, per CNN and ABC News. The pellets caused injuries throughout Arbery’s body, including a damaged right lung, fractured left upper arm and shoulder blade, and a  deep, gaping, shotgun graze  to his right wrist.

The former president doesn't see that as his role, and that would remain the case even if his former VP, Joe Biden, enters the race.

Politico, meanwhile, notes that many polls have Biden leading the Democratic contenders with roughly 30% of the prospective vote. However, the story throws cold water on a lead of that size. Factoring in undecided voters, it figures Biden's backing is closer to 10%.

The New York Times, however, says it was just one  subgroup  that promoted Said and sees this as evidence of a possible rift in the Taliban group. As for Said, the 38-year-old had long served as Rehman's deputy, and he helped plan some major operations, like a massive jailbreak last year, and an attack on a Karachi naval base the year before that. The Taliban was initially slow to confirm Rehman's death, but they have now done so—and are vowing revenge, reports CNN.  We hold the government of Pakistan responsible for this killing,  a group spokesman said.  We will teach a lesson to Pakistan and the United States for depriving us of our beloved leader.",Meet the Pakistani Taliban's New No. 2

"(Jul 30, 2019  11:54 AM CDT) It was a prank. But that's not how a Columbus City Schools security officer characterized the incident to responding police in the Ohio city: It  could be attempted murder.  The November incident, in which 7th graders caused a teacher to go into anaphylactic shock by exposing her to bananas, is just now being reported by way of ABC 6, which has been investigating Columbus City School teachers' safety concerns and working conditions. It reports that it was well known that the art teacher at Starling K-8 school has an extreme allergy to bananas: Signs outside her room deem it a  Banana-Free Zone ; another sign directs students who have consumed one to wash their hands. But three middle-schoolers, ages 12 and 13, reportedly smeared banana on her door and doorknob and even threw them at her during a lunch period. Within 15 minutes she was in anaphylactic shock and taken to a hospital. She recovered, and the students were sentenced to probation in juvenile court. Medical News Today reports banana allergies are rare but explains the proteins in the fruit are similar to those in latex. In other recent allergy news, a tragic story out of the UK was reported last week: In June, a father gave his son a few squares of chocolate, thinking they were dairy-free. They were actually gluten-free but did contain dairy; the 11-year-old died after consuming what the Manchester Evening News reports was a  very small piece.",7th Graders' Banana Prank Could Have Killed Teacher
"(May 26, 2011  1:33 PM CDT) It's starting to look like Americans haven't moved from the couch all week. Early numbers show yesterday's finale of The Oprah Winfrey Show drew the most viewers it has had in 17 years. The final episode—which featured no guests, but rather a personal conversation between Oprah, her studio audience ... and millions watching at home—garnered a 13.3 household rating in the nation's metered markets, according to Nielsen. The last time an Oprah episode had a number that high was back in February 1994— People Shed Their Disguises  featured Oprah confronting guests about their questionable outward appearances. The metered market rating for Monday's surprise farewell episode of Oprah logged a 10.2, and Tuesday's episode got a 10.7. Other major draws: the finales of both American Idol and Dancing With the Stars. Idol's rating are particularly noteworthy as they show the first season-to-season growth in the number of finale watchers since 2008, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Total viewers were up 17% over 2010. Idol also bested the DWTS finale by 32%, but DWTS beat the next-to-last Idol episode. (Too much TV?

"(Oct 7, 2015  5:10 PM CDT) Nearly half of all Americans—49%—have no money in their savings account or no savings account at all, CNBC reports.  It’s worrisome that such a large percentage of Americans have so little set aside,  a financial analyst for the site that conducted the survey tells Market Watch.  They likely don’t have cash reserves to cover an emergency and will have to rely on credit, friends, and family.  The survey of 5,000 people found that 62% of Americans have less than $1,000 saved, while only 14% had more than $10,000 in their savings account. These numbers come despite a September survey showing Americans are getting more interested in—and being more effective at—saving money, CNBC reports. Last month's numbers for interest, effectiveness, and effort toward saving were the highest ever for the survey. However the survey did come to the obvious conclusion that the country's biggest earners—those making more than $100,000 a year—were by far better at saving money than those in a lower income bracket. According to the federal government, Americans on average saved 4.6% of their disposable income in August.",49% of Americans Have Nothing Saved
"(Apr 27, 2011  2:09 PM CDT) The jury didn’t spend long considering the case of John Richardson, who was on trial for stealing a 99-cent hot dog. The chilling true crime tale goes like this: The Eastern Washington University student walked into a grocery store, grabbed a hot dog from the self-serve counter, and ate it while shopping. He paid for the rest of his groceries ($28), but neglected to fork over a buck for the sausage. When confronted about it, he offered to pay—but store managers refused and called the cops. The jury was dumbfounded, acquitting Richardson after the bare minimum of deliberation.  You’d have to be an idiot not to realize that the guy simply forgot,  one juror tells the Spokesman-Review.  It took the jury about five minutes to come to a verdict.  So why bother holding a full-blown trial over a hot dog?

The Fed also committed to buying up to $600 billion in debt issued by housing lenders.

Okanogan County Sheriff Tony Hawley says Uriel Hyland died and parents Jacob Hyland, 31, and Jamie Hyland, 26, were severely burned while trying to escape the Cold Springs Fire, Fox reports. Relatives tells KHQ that the family, who live in the Seattle area, were trapped by the fire while visiting a property they'd inherited in Okanogan, 150 miles northwest of Spokane. Their burned vehicle was discovered Tuesday after they were reported missing. Rescuers found the family early Wednesday on the banks of the Columbia River. The boy was dead at the scene and his parents were hospitalized in critical condition with third-degree burns, authorities say. The sheriff's office says the family was apparently forced to abandon the truck, which was found near their property. The Cold Springs Fire, which started Sunday and exploded in size Monday, has burned 337,000 acres together with the nearby Pearl Hill Fire. Hawley says the cause of the fire is still unclear, but if it turns out to be arson, the child's death will be treated as a possible homicide.  To even be talking about the death of a 1-year-old is just devastating,  the sheriff tells the Spokesman-Review.

"(Oct 23, 2015  9:36 AM CDT) Twitter employees have had a chaotic go of it over the past few weeks: first the shakeup of co-founder Jack Dorsey coming on board permanently as CEO, then an unpleasant round of layoffs that purged 8% of the company's staff. Brighter news, however, has since come down their feeds, Fortune reports.  I'm giving ~1/3rd of my Twitter stock (exactly 1% of the company) to our employee equity pool to reinvest directly in our people,  he tweeted Thursday evening, when he also held a staff meeting to make his announcement, per the New York Times. Using his 22 million shares as the baseline, that percentage amounts to about 7 million shares, worth roughly $200 million, dumped into the worker's equity base, Fortune notes. Those shares can then be granted to new hires, as a bonus, or as other incentives. Why exactly Dorsey donned his Santa suit a bit early is up for speculation. The Washington Post, which calls the move  quite rare  due to its value, speculates he could have done it either to make nice with employees after the morale-busting layoffs, reward workers with equity without watering down other shares' value, or generate excitement before next week's earning call.  I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small. I'm confident we can make Twitter big!  he followed up on Twitter.

The bread is so hard on those subs,  he tells NJ.com. So he removed his teeth, tucked them in a napkin, and forgot all about them. That was especially problematic because they aren't just any dentures; they were specially made with bone marrow and cost $80,000, Dykstra says. When he realized he'd left without the dentures and went back to Jersey Mike's, employees told him the napkins had all been thrown in the trash.

The Fayetteville, NC, woman was on Monday awarded that amount by a jury, to be paid by her ex-husband and his new partner, in what the Fayetteville Observer says is apparently the state's  first revenge porn lawsuit to reach a jury verdict.  Clark's case against Adam Clark and Kimberly Barrett also included accusations of libel—she claimed he falsely posted online that she had herpes and an eating disorder—and alienation-of-affection, which refers to a 3rd party breaking up a marriage. That marriage began in April 2010 and produced two children. She alleged that her husband, an Army major, and Barrett, an Army lieutenant colonel, met six years later at a Virginia base. A 2018 report on the case from the Daily News of Jacksonville quotes the suit as saying Elizabeth Clark noticed a change while her husband was in Virginia:  His mobile device began to show his location at the opposite end of the hotel where his room was located. Additionally, his credit card charges doubled for routine expenses such as meals and entertainment.  The suit says he ultimately admitted to the affair. Elizabeth Clark's lawyer described Barrett as over 40, wanting kids, and deciding to pull Adam Clark away from his wife in order to achieve that. The lawyer said the two have since had a child. As for the revenge-porn part of the suit, Elizabeth Clark claimed Adam Clark posted topless photos of her online.

"(Oct 9, 2020  7:44 AM CDT) A Nobel laureate who helped prove how dangerous chlorofluorocarbons are to the ozone layer and who served as a scientific adviser to President Obama has died. Dr. Mario Molina, a US citizen born in Mexico, passed away Wednesday at the age of 77 at his Mexico City home, the Washington Post reports. When Dr. Molina first started studying CFCs—industrial chemicals used in coolants for air conditioners and refrigerators, deodorant sprays, and other aerosols—it wasn't believed they caused any harm to the environment. Along with UC Irvine professor F. Sherwood Rowland, however, Molina discovered that CFCs actually did pose a significant danger, by depleting the ozone layer. That discovery led to the scientists winning the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen. Now, the world says goodbye to the man called  one of the single most important contributors to climate protection in world history  by former White House climate adviser Paul Bledsoe, per Science. Molina's environmental nonprofit says he died of  unexpected cardiac problems,  Reuters reports. Molina's work jump-started international efforts to curb CFCs, including 1987's Montreal Protocol, which imposed regulations on man-made chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. Environmental attorney Durwood Zaelke says Molina always remained a  gentleman,  even when the chemicals industry  vilified  him for his work against CFCs.

His main contact was the firm’s chief lobbyist, Mitchell Delk. Delk says he never asked Gingrich to do any lobbying  of any kind  for him, however, and that he instead provided  counsel on public policy issues.  But former Freddie Mac officials say Gingrich was asked to help the company reach out to congressional Republicans in 2006, and to help craft arguments to win over conservatives skeptical of the firm’s public-private structure. He was also supposed to provide a white paper for this purpose, but never did so. In the debate, Gingrich said he’d just been a  historian  for the company, and had told them their lending practices were  insane,  but all of Bloomberg’s sources agree that he never criticized the company.

Asteroid 2013 TX68 is scheduled to pass us by on March 5, coming as close as 11,000 miles (or a little more than the distance between Seattle and South Africa), CBS News reports. However it could also be as far away as 9 million miles. According to Gizmodo, the asteroid's most likely path puts it at a distance of 1 million miles from Earth. Amateur astronomers should be at the ready anyway, as a flyby at the closer end of the asteroid's range would make it visible with a telescope. The asteroid, which was discovered in October 2013, passed by Earth two years ago at a distance of 1.3 million miles. Even though it's predicted to possibly come closer this time around, NASA states there is no chance it will hit the Earth. According to a press release, there is a one in 250 million chance it will collide with the planet during another flyby in 2017, though NASA says that probability is  too small to be of any real concern.

Authorities say they bought the drug, formally called U-47700, online from China with the help of friends. Each boy died at home of  acute drug intoxication,  say police in the resort town of Park City. Authorities say the boys enlisted the help of a 15-year-old to order the drug, and he was due in court Friday on charges of felony distribution of a controlled or counterfeit substance and misdemeanor reckless endangerment, reports the Salt Lake Tribune.

The current owners, a married couple with three children, bought it in June 2014 for nearly $1.4 million. But they refused to move in due to eerie letters they say they received from a person with a  mentally disturbed fixation  on the home. The couple took the house off the market last summer after suing the previous owners. But they put the house up for sale again last week.

"(Dec 13, 2020  5:25 PM) John Le Carré, perhaps the greatest living spy novelist, died Saturday in England. The 89-year-old lost his life to pneumonia, his family said. Le Carré was  an undisputed giant of English literature,  his longtime agent told the Guardian.  He defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power in the decades that followed … I have lost a mentor, an inspiration and most importantly, a friend. We will not see his like again.  Revered for his nuanced, literary thrillers, Le Carré found wide acclaim with The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in 1963 and three 1970s novels featuring George Smiley, a surprisingly short, plump, and understated agent in the era of James Bond. The first, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, was among several Le Carré works adapted by the BBC and Hollywood. Le Carré's other books—including The Night Manager, The Constant Gardener, and A Legacy of Spies—portrayed an ambiguous world of espionage in which protagonists delved into shadows of right and wrong.  Thematically, Le Carré's true subject is not spying,  wrote one author, per the New York Times.  It is the endlessly deceptive maze of human relations.

"(Apr 23, 2012  1:18 PM CDT) What would you say if President Obama took $8.3 billion in taxpayer money and used it for his reelection campaign? Because that's exactly what he's done by giving Medicare Advantage a stay of execution, according to Benjamin Sasse and Charles Hurt of the New York Post. The law, they explain,  guts  the market-oriented Medicare alternative, reducing its reimbursement rates to drive people into Medicare proper. Seniors will have to pick a plan in October—just weeks before the election.  Nothing is more politically volatile than monkeying with the health insurance of seniors,  they write.  This could make the Tea Party look like a tea party.  Obama's solution? He's temporarily extending the program with billions taken from a Health and Human Services slush fund intended to pay for  experiments  in improving costs or care. Extending a long-running program hardly qualifies, Sasse and Hurt argue.  Congress should immediately launch an investigation,  they write,  into this unprecedented misuse of taxpayer money and violation of the public trust.

Rising unemployment is straining friendships as the haves learn to interact with the have-nots. Among 30- and 40-somethings, discussing luxurious vacation plans is not a good idea, and for the 50-plus set, retirement talk is strictly off-limits. But not talking about work can be dangerous, according to some doctors.

Trooper Rick Johnson, a Washington State Patrol information officer, tweeted Thursday that an officer encountered a vehicle he thought was disabled parked on the shoulder of Highway 518 near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. But when Sgt. Kyle Smith approached the vehicle, he discovered that the driver was playing the game on no fewer than eight phones, the Seattle Times reports. The driver had put all eight phones in an apparently home-made foam holder next to him. The driver  agreed to put phones in back seat and continued his commute with 8 less distractions,  Johnson said, adding that since Smith hadn't seen him playing while driving, the driver was let go with a warning to only pull to the shoulder in emergencies.

"(Jul 30, 2013  9:43 AM CDT) The US started construction on Afghanistan's Kajaki dam in the early 1950s—and it's still not done.  After using multiple contractors and sub­contractors, spending tens of millions of dollars, and losing scores of US and coalition lives, the work is still not complete,  writes the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction in a report out today. And here's his best line, per USA Today:  The ancient Egyptians took less time—about 20 to 25 years—to complete the Great Pyramid at Giza.  The remote dam in the mountains above the Helmand valley, which holds a small combat outpost where Marines and Afghan soldiers serve, still needs $75 million worth of work (the US has spent that much on it since 2004), and the US is planning to hand it over to the Afghans to finish as part of the withdrawal process. The special inspector general's office isn't sure Afghanistan can manage it—even though, as Stars and Stripes reports, the US is supplying Afghanistan’s national utility with cash for the final phase, which will see a third turbine installed. That turbine installation effort has been ongoing since 2001, and Stars and Stripes notes that  it is often pointed to as one of the signature failures of America's aid program in Afghanistan.",US Has Been Building Afghan Dam Since 1950s

He has arthritis and a Pacemaker and uses a cane; he's served on a number of boards in the community; he used to work at a local paper plant; and he told his wife, Gennell Eubanks, that he once killed a man in  the accident that happened  decades ago—but said he never meant for it to happen, she tells the AP. Yesterday, federal agents arrested Miller on 33-year-old murder charges after tracking him to Mineola, and Miller was quick to confess. They say Miller shot a man in the head in a parking lot outside a hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1981. The victim, Thomas Waller, was found dead inside his car. Miller was charged with murder and three other felonies, but fled the state. Investigators got a tip that he had been living in Mexico under the name of his deceased cousin, and used that information to trace him to Texas. Miller's wife says her husband claimed he was trying to help his brother during a fight when Waller was killed, and that his relatives in Pennsylvania  didn't want him to come back. They told him to leave.  Oddly, Miller also pleaded guilty in a 1959 murder, but his life sentence was commuted in 1971 after he had served more than 11 years, the Patriot-News reports.

But instead of providing the number, she countered with a two-page essay. A  proud  family friend posted photographs of her work on Facebook on March 30. The self-described  bigger girl  opens up about her own body image struggles, which recently involved trying  to wrap Ace bandages around my stomach so I'd look skinnier.  Her concerned parents took her to her doctor,  a man who went to college for eight years studying children's health [and] told me my height and weight are right on track.  She concludes by writing that her BMI is not only  none of your concern  but is also  beautiful,  as is her body. She also argues that BMI is an outdated index that has  absolutely no way of discriminating [between] fat and muscle.  Indeed, a study published in Nature in March finds that almost half of people considered  overweight  through this measure actually have a healthy cardiometabolic profile calculated using such factors as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, while about a third of the  normal  BMI people had unhealthy profiles. But a CDC study to be presented Friday argues in favor of the measure's usefulness; it found that an infant's BMI at 6 to 18 months can predict those who are prone to obesity in early childhood.

The parents haven't paid and are appealing.  When he ruled that way, I said there is no way she is getting anything from me until we establish some kind of a relationship again,  Ricci's dad says.

According to a report released by the ESA, the Schiaparelli lander had deployed its parachute and was descending normally when the device that measured how fast it was spinning sent erroneous information to the navigation system that led it to conclude that it was below the surface of the planet. The lander, believing it must have landed, ditched its parachute, fired its braking thrusters, activated its on-ground systems—and then plummeted 2.3 miles to the ground. The ESA says the glitch in the Inertial Measurement Unit was a momentary one, reports Reuters. The glitch also occurred during computer simulations of the response to the erroneous information, which should make the problem easy to identify, the ESA says. Schiaparelli was supposed to be testing technology for a 2020 ESA Mars landing and while its mission was much, much shorter than anticipated, the agency says it still picked up some readings from the Martian atmosphere that will be passed to science teams.

Where other states' retirement systems try to come up with the most complex investments possible to beat the markets, the 44-year-old Edmundson has a different philosophy when it comes to day-to-day trading:  Do as little as possible, usually nothing,  as the Journal puts it. And by  nothing,  that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices, the elections, or even what Janet Yellen is up to—an approach that's rare among managers of large pension funds, the New York Times noted last year in an article about Edmundson. This laissez-faire tactic has served Edmundson well: His system's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive, if not better, than the pension systems of other states, including the largest public one—California's. Even Edmundson's desk looks like it's his first day on the job, with just basic office supplies, a few family pics, and a printer—no fancy Bloomberg Terminal to monitor real-time market info. Edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds, though one investment strategy expert (who held the job before Edmundson) concedes  doing nothing is harder than it looks  when it comes to showing such restraint. Edmundson's minimalist philosophy even carries over to lunch: He brings leftovers or a sandwich from home so he doesn't have to spend $10 each day.

"(Jul 30, 2013  3:48 PM CDT) Eileen Brennan, who went from musical comedy on Broadway to wringing laughs out of memorable characters in such films as Private Benjamin and Clue, has died at age 80 of bladder cancer. Brennan got her first big role on the New York stage in Little Mary Sunshine, a musical comedy that won her the 1960 Obie award for best actress. But it was a series of sharp-tongued roles that won her fans on television and in movies, including gruff Army Capt. Doreen Lewis in 1980's Private Benjamin, aloof Mrs. Peacock in 1985's Clue, and mean orphanage superintendent Miss Bannister in 1988's The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking.  I love meanies, and this goes back to Capt. Lewis in Private Benjamin,  Brennan said in a 1988 interview.  You know why? Because they have no sense of humor. People who are mean or unkind or rigid—think about it—cannot laugh at themselves. If we can't laugh at ourselves and the human condition, we're going to be mean.  Private Benjamin brought her a supporting actress nomination for an Oscar. She also won an Emmy for repeating her Private Benjamin role in the television version, and was nominated six other times for guest roles on such shows as Newhart, thirtysomething, Taxi, and Will & Grace.",Private Benjamin's Eileen Brennan Dead at 80

"(Nov 12, 2016  4:45 PM) The death toll from a bomb blast at a Sufi shrine in southwest Pakistan Saturday has risen to 50 people with more than 100 wounded, officials said. The Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the suicide attack at the shrine of Sufi saint Shah Bilal Noorani in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, the AP reports. Abdur Rasool, an official at the province's home ministry, said rescuers were transporting the wounded to hospitals and the dead to local morgues, but were struggling in the difficult mountainous terrain. The blast targeted worshippers as they were in the throes of their devotional  dhamal  dance, and the courtyard at the time was packed with families, women, and children. The Islamic State group's statement on the IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency said the suicide attack had targeted  Shiites.  The shrine is frequented by both Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority and Shiite minority. IS considers all Shiite Muslims heretics. Baluchistan home minister Sarfaraz Bugti, citing a lack of cellular services in the affected area, said the situation will be much clearer in the morning. He said over 500 people were present in the courtyard of the shrine when the blast happened. One female witness, who was not identified by name, told the GEO television channel that a  big bang  took place in the midst of the dhamal dance in the shrine's courtyard.  I don't know how I escaped unhurt,  she said.  It was like a hell all around.",Death Toll Rises to 50 in IS Suicide Attack in Pakistan
"(May 25, 2008  8:12 AM CDT) Quake-devastated China suffered yet another major setback today when it was rocked by the strongest aftershock since the May 12 earthquake, Bloomberg reports. At least one person was killed and 400 injured when a 5.8 magnitude quake toppled some 70,000 homes in Sichuan province, according to Reuters. The quake hit as troops laden with explosives were trekking to blow a hole in a dam to relieve flooding pressure triggered by a mudslide into a giant lake. Authorities hope to lower the level of the lake before the dam bursts, causing a flash flood. China is facing repeated aftershocks as it struggles to also deal with secondary quake disasters like flooding and landslides, epidemics, food and water shortages, and sheltering 5 million displaced people. Some 69 reservoirs are in  immediate danger  of bursting, said a government official.","70,000 Homes Collapse in New China Aftershock"

"(Jun 24, 2019  11:39 AM CDT) India's Supreme Court on Monday directed state and national authorities to file reports to the court on an encephalitis outbreak in the eastern state of Bihar this month in which 152 children have died. A senior Bihar health department official, Sanjay Kumar, said the epidemic is showing signs of slowing, with no new deaths on Monday. The fatalities have occurred in 20 of the state's 38 districts, the AP reports. More than 700 cases of encephalitis have been registered since the outbreak began June 1, officials said. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the illness, which can cause swelling of the brain, fever, and vomiting. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heat wave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 114.5 Fahrenheit.  We're hoping with the onset of the monsoon, the epidemic will ease further,  Kumar said. The Supreme Court was responding to a petition filed by a lawyer.  The deaths of children are a direct result of negligence and inaction  on the part of authorities, per the petitioner. The court expressed concern over the deaths and asked the governments to respond within seven days with details on medical facilities, nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene conditions in the state. Thousands of Indians suffer from encephalitis, malaria, typhoid, and other mosquito-borne diseases each year during the summer monsoon season. India's central government has sent medical experts to Bihar to help doctors treat the patients. The Bihar authorities have been sharply criticized because patients were sharing beds in crowded hospital wards with too few doctors.

"(Mar 14, 2017  2:03 PM CDT) Meet music lover Bradley, outdoor enthusiast Preston, hip-hop dancer Layla, Pokemon card collector Landon, and Olive, who mainly likes to be snuggled. These are the five siblings the Kansas City Star featured in its  Family Wanted  section on Saturday, and they're looking to all be adopted by the same family. Response to the ad about the siblings has been  pretty insane,  Corey Lada of the Kansas Children's Service League, affiliated with the state's Adopt Kansas Kids organization, tells the Star. The original ad has been clicked more than 4 million times. The kids, ages 2 to 11, are identified only by their first names, and Lada didn't reveal much else about them other than to say they're all in different foster homes and that their case has been removed from the state website because so many inquiries have poured in. Some critics have suggested the response has been so great because the kids are white: One Overland Park resident, for instance, says the children look like they stepped out of a  Lands' End ad  and that kids of other races—the Star notes Kansas has around 1,200 kids looking for families—don't get the same hype. Still, the director of an unrelated Kansas nonprofit says she hopes the kids end up under one roof.  That bond between siblings is the strongest thing they've got when parents are gone,  she says. It's not impossible: A couple in Missouri is in the process of adopting five siblings, ages 6 to 15, from a Filipino orphanage, reports the Joplin Globe. Husband Aaron Jones recalls seeing his wife, Stephanie, crying while looking at their images online.  Oh cute, which one?  he asked. With his wife crying too hard to respond, he said,  All of them?

The long-awaited figures come from the Congressional Budget Office, clearing the way for Harry Reid to move forward. The bill would cut the federal deficit by $127 billion over that decade, says the CBO estimate. Debate is expected to begin on the measure this week. The bill would set up new insurance marketplaces—called exchanges—primarily for those who now have a hard time getting or keeping coverage.

"(Feb 13, 2008  7:54 AM) Six 9/11 suspects detained at Gitmo could be executed at the controversial prison compound if found guilty, legal experts say. Military regulations used to require that executions take place at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, but that rule was amended two years ago to allow prisoners to be executed in  other places.  The creation of a Guantanamo Bay execution chamber would keep the men largely out of the reach of US courts, experts believe.  I think that's the administration's idea, to use Guantanamo as a base to not be under the umbrella of the federal district courts,  said a former Navy attorney. US officials have announced that they will seek the death penalty against the suspects. Any executions would be certain to cause international outrage, although the AP reports that US diplomats have been instructed to remind critics that Nazi war criminals were executed after the Nuremberg trials.",9/11 Executions Could Take Place in Gitmo
"(Nov 6, 2020  11:46 AM) China has temporarily banned the entry of foreigners from at least eight countries as COVID-19 cases rise in Europe and elsewhere. Non-Chinese can no longer enter from Russia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, even if they hold a valid visa or residence permit for China, the AP reports. Embassies in those countries have posted online notices in recent days announcing the temporary suspension of entry. China, where the coronavirus first emerged, has enacted strict measures to guard against new infections from abroad. Health authorities on Friday reported 30 imported cases in the most recent 24-hour period, including 15 in Shanghai. That brought the total number of imported cases during the pandemic to 3,510. China largely closed its borders in March but in recent months, it had relaxed restrictions, allowing some foreign nationals to enter if they tested negative for the virus and spent two weeks in quarantine, AFP reports. The country is now  drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation,  a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday.

Experts from the Museum of London have uncovered a yard and gallery walls from the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch, just east of London's business district. The Curtain opened in 1577 and was home to Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, until the Globe Theatre was built across the river two years later. Plays premiered at the Curtain are thought to include Henry V, which famously describes the structure as  this wooden O.

Four of the cases involved gay men and three were HIV positive, the Los Angeles Times reports; two of those who died were HIV positive. None of the deceased, who died in February or March, had been in direct contact with each other, the AP notes.  I think the important thing to understand is this is not an epidemic,  the medical director of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center says.  But there's a pretty strong signal that men who have sex with men, at least those who are HIV positive, are at increased risk for invasive meningococcal disease.  Yesterday's news of the deaths comes almost exactly a year after meningitis—a disease spread by contact with saliva or nose mucus—killed another LA man, and a day after the Department of Public Health urged gay men who are HIV positive, or have multiple partners, to get vaccinated.

He was 77. Hurt, who battled pancreatic cancer, died Friday in London, according to his agent, Charles McDonald. Twice nominated for an Oscar, for playing the tortured John Merrick in David Lynch's The Elephant Man and for his role as the heroin addict Max in Midnight Express, Hurt's career spanned over 50 years. After minor television and film appearances, his breakout came in 1966 as Richard Rich in Fred Zinnemann's A Man For All Seasons, followed by his portrayal of Caligula in the BBC miniseries I, Claudius in 1976. Hurt was also a prolific voice actor, appearing as Hazel in the animated Watership Down, and as Aragorn in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings. He also voiced The Horned King in The Black Cauldron and provided the narration for Dogville. In the Harry Potter films, Hurt played the wand-maker Mr. Ollivander.

The company announced Wednesday that it  will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America.  In a financial release, Ford said that it plans to transition to just two cars over the next few years: the Ford Mustang and the new Ford Active, a  crossover  vehicle to be released next year. Ford currently sells the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, C-Max, Mustang, and Taurus sedans and coupes in North America reports TechCrunch, which notes that the Lincoln sedans are also expected to vanish. Ford hasn't said exactly when the Taurus and other models will be phased out, but the company's statement says almost 90% of its North America portfolio will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles by 2020.

The nation's third largest city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents last year than it did in 2015, according to data released Sunday by the Chicago Police Department. The statistics underline a story of bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The numbers are staggering, even for those who followed the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens of shootings, the AP reports. The increase in homicides compared to 2015, when 485 were reported, is the largest spike in 60 years. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, and the crime statistics appeared to support their claims: Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference Sunday that anger at police, including in the wake of video released that showed a white Chicago officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, has left criminals  emboldened  to violent crimes. He also said it's becoming clearer to criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system.  In Chicago, we just don't have a deterrent to pick up a gun,  he said.

But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a  perfect storm  of  lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply.  In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls  food insecure  people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from  moderate  malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected.  The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time,  Cousin says.  We must act now before it is too late.  Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that  the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible,  per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with  extreme  food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida.

Ringing Bells originally said it would ship 2.5 million units of its Freedom 251 phone—a 3G Android with a 4-inch screen, 8GB of storage, an 8MP main camera, and a 3.2MP selfie camera—by the end of June, per Android Authority, but now CEO Mohit Goel tells the Indian Express that's been dropped down to 200,000 shipped out by June 30, with more soon to come.

Now we have a … dual-SIM phone ready for delivery. I feel vindicated.  Talk of the phone has raised disbelieving eyebrows since it was announced: In February, Ars Technica called the whole deal  awfully shady,  noting that initial previews of the phone showed an unattractive, cheap-looking unit that appeared to be another company's phone  rebranded  with white correcting fluid.

In the city of Wonsan, hooded victims were tied to poles in front of a stadium of 10,000 people, where they were shot with machine guns, the source says. Crimes reportedly included possessing a Bible, watching smuggled South Korean TV shows, and distributing pornography, the Los Angeles Times and AFP report.  I heard from the residents that ... the corpses were so riddled by machine-gun fire that they were hard to identify afterwards,  the source told JoongAng Ilbo, one of the South's top newspapers, which wasn't able to confirm the executions, the Daily Mail notes. The punishments may have been intended to shut down dissent and pro-capitalist sentiment, the JoongAng Ilbo suggests.  The regime is obviously afraid of potential changes in people's mind-sets and is preemptively trying to scare people off,  an official at a defectors' website tells AFP.

Sure, tweets may only be 140 characters at most, but they required the approval of 22 different people  towards the end of the campaign,  a digital media campaign staffer says in a new study.  Whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone,  Caitlin Checkett told journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, as Politico reports. The campaign's digital director calls them  the best tweets ever written by 17 people,  Vox reports. At the Obama campaign, things were a little different. Digital head Teddy Goff's four-person team  had significantly more autonomy  to decide what should be posted, the study says. That made it easier to respond right away to events like Clint Eastwood's Republican convention speech.

So instead, the British Library called it a  unification event  today when the priceless documents were put on display together for the first time. The event marks the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, which established the timeless principle that no individual, even a monarch, is above the law. The original Magna Carta manuscripts were written and sealed in late June and early July 1215, then sent individually throughout England, making today's unification unique.  It's a real moment in history,  says Julian Harrison, the library's curator of medieval manuscripts.  Magna Carta has significance not just in England but worldwide. Many people regard it as the foundation of the rule of law. It established key principles [that] have resonated worldwide.  In 1215, 40 rebellious barons came together to declare their rights to King John, and he reluctantly consented to their demands to try to avoid civil war. The Magna Carta included acknowledgments that taxes can't be arbitrary and that free men can't be imprisoned without first being judged by peers or the law. Within weeks, the pope voided the agreement, and England was thrown into war (the document was later incorporated into English law). Officials said the unification will give the public, as well as scholars and medieval manuscript experts, a chance to scrutinize and compare the documents. Some 1,215 people—randomly selected from more than 43,000 applicants from more than 20 countries—will get to see the Magna Cartas tomorrow.

The US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio says that Elizabeth Lecron, 24, was sentenced this week to 15 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to terrorism charges in August. She had planned an attack with her boyfriend, Vincent Armstrong, on an unnamed Toledo bar, as well as purchased black powder and hundreds of screws to make bombs to destroy a Georgia pipeline. Per two USAO releases, Lecron and Armstrong started dating in mid-2018, and the two soon became  immersed  in an online extremist group called  True Crime Community,  which obsessed over mass murders  and posted extremely graphic images, videos, and sayings.  The USAO says the couple started planning the Toledo attack, which they called  D-Day ; in a June 2018 journal entry, Lecron wrote,  D-Day will be my salvation.  Lecron also became pen pals with Charleston gunman Dylann Roof, writing  numerous letters  to him in prison. In addition to the weapons, ammo, and pipe bomb materials the two purchased, they also bought clothing to wear while carrying out the attacks, investigators say. Per WTVG, Armstrong picked up a trench coat and a T-shirt that said  Society Failed Us,  while Lecron bought combat boots she thought wouldn't slip on blood and a T-shirt that said  False Prophet.  Armstrong also pleaded guilty in August to terrorism charges and will be sentenced on Dec. 10. After Lecron gets out of prison, she'll be subject to lifetime supervision, per Judge James G.

A mob infuriated by the deaths beat the driver severely and set fire to coaches, officials say. Dinesh Chandra Yadav, a local member of parliament, says the pilgrims were crossing the tracks of the packed, chaotic station in the small town of Dhamara Ghat, in Bihar state, when they were struck by the Rajya Rani Express train. Several other people were injured. Railway official Arunendra Kumar says the train was not supposed to halt at the station and had been given clearance to pass through, but some pilgrims waited on the tracks thinking they could stop the train, he says. The train stopped a few hundred yards beyond the spot where it hit the pilgrims. Angry mobs then pulled out the train driver and beat him—Yadav says the driver was killed, but Kumar says he's in hospital in critical condition. The mob then got all the passengers out of the train and set some coaches on fire. Groups of young men also smashed the windows of two other trains that were in the station. A crowd of around 5,000 people gathered near the station and were chasing away the district officials who tried to remove the bodies from the tracks. The crowds blocked the railway tracks and the few policemen posted at the station had fled, state officials say.","37 Hindu Pilgrims Run Over, Killed by Train"

The unidentified adult becomes the second person to die from the infamous disease this year. A 16-year-old star baseball player died of the plague in June. Both victims likely had a rare septicemic form of the plague, which is hard to diagnose because it doesn't include the typical swelling of lymph nodes seen in most plague cases. Cases of the plague are rare in the United States, and deaths are even rarer. On average, seven human plague cases are reported in the United States every year, but Colorado had eight plague cases of its own last year.

The record rise—which, contrary to some predictions, even the recession couldn’t curb—means that hopes of keeping global warming to a safe level is nearly out of reach, the Guardian reports in an exclusive. The paper had previously reported that in order to prevent potentially  dangerous climate change,  we must keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. But the IEA's chief economist now says that idea is just  a nice Utopia.

The government had been seeking damages under the False Claims Act because the disgraced cyclist used performance-enhancing drugs while his team was sponsored by the US Postal Service, CNN reports. The service paid $31 million to sponsor the team between 2001 and 2004.  No one is above the law,  Chad Readler at the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement.  A competitor who intentionally uses illegal PEDs not only deceives fellow competitors and fans, but also sponsors, who help make sporting competitions possible.

The woman died three weeks later, and her estate filed a lawsuit against the children and their parents. The judge didn't determine liability in the case—only that the girl can be sued. There was no evidence that the girl lacked intelligence or maturity, and nothing to  indicate that another child of similar age and capacity under the circumstances could not have reasonably appreciated the danger of riding a bicycle into an elderly woman,  the judge wrote, citing cases from as far back as 1928. He decided that the girl's mother, who was present at the time, didn't encourage her daughter's risky behavior, and that she played no  active role  in the incident, the New York Times reports.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said if that if that were the case, it would be  an unprecedented attack on freedom of the press and democracy in Slovakia  and announced his government was offering $1.23 million to anyone who helped the authorities find the people responsible, reports the AP.","$1.23M Reward Offered After Journo, Girlfriend Found Dead"
"(Nov 19, 2016  11:35 AM) After World War II, Argentina decided to boost the local fur trade by dumping a smattering of beavers into the Tierra del Fuego archipelago. Now, 70 years later, local officials there are describing a  totally out of control  situation, with the free-to-roam rodents accused of decimating a region of woodlands that's said to be twice the size of Buenos Aires, the BBC reports.  When we saw a picture of a beaver dam in the forest, it … looked like a bomb had fallen,  Nicolas Iacouzzi, the co-creator of a documentary on the beavers, says, per Foreign Policy. And so there's now a plan in place, with the help of next-door neighbor Chile, to wipe out a population that's grown to 100,000 thanks to a lack of natural predators. Scientists explain that in North America, trees can often withstand beaver gnawing, but South American trees tend to die off.  [The beavers] can cut down a small tree in a few hours and a big one in days. We are talking about trees that are 100 or 150 years old, and they do not grow back,  the region's conservation chief says, per Phys.org. Another major issue is that dams that the beavers build produce bogs that stifle trees from growing. The game plan for now, per the head of the National Strategy for Invasive Exotic Species, is to train hunters from North America to set  humane  traps in seven  pilot areas  around the region. Once caught, the beavers would then be  quickly  clubbed to death on the head. The project could take 10 to 15 years, experts say. (Here, a video made around 1950 of parachuting beavers.)",Argentina Gears Up for War Against 100K Beavers
"(Jan 10, 2017  2:03 AM) Deshaun Watson took the snap, rolled right, and with one of the easiest throws he had to make all night, completed Clemson's journey to the top of college football. A frantic fourth quarter and a championship rematch between Clemson and Alabama was decided with one second left on a 2-yard touchdown toss to Hunter Renfrow.  I couldn't hear the crowd,  Watson said, per the AP.  I just felt at peace.  Watson and the Tigers dethroned the defending champs and became the first team to beat Nick Saban's Alabama dynasty in a national title game, taking down the top-ranked Crimson Tide 35-31 Monday night in the College Football Playoff. A 35-year title drought for Clemson is over; the Tigers are national champions for the first time since 1981. A year after Alabama won its fourth title under Saban with a classic 45-40 win in Arizona, Clemson (14-1) denied the Tide (14-1) an unprecedented fifth championship in eight seasons in what Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said  has to be one of the greatest games of all time.  The lead changed hands three times in the fourth quarter, with the Tigers leading 28-24 with 4:38 left. The Tide responded with a 30-yard touchdown pass to make it 31-28 with 2:07 left. But Watson got the ball last.  I just smiled right when they scored,  Watson said, per the Tampa Bay Times.  I just told my guys, hey, let's be legendary, let's go be great.  Playing in his final college game, the junior quarterback threw for 420 yards and three touchdowns, battling through four sacks.

Bloomberg LP has identified 3 NDAs signed over the past 30+ years with women to address complaints about comments they said I had made,  the presidential candidate wrote in a tweet.  If any of them want to be released from their NDAs, they should contact the company and they'll be given a release.  Bloomberg was pressured heavily on the matter in a Democratic debate Wednesday—and since then—especially by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who wrote up a release for him to use Thursday. He said during the debate that he would not offer to tear up the confidentiality agreements, which Bloomberg said were signed  consensually,  per NBC.  They signed those agreements,  he said Wednesday,  and we'll live with it.  As he'd said before, Bloomberg answered in the debate that he was never accused of anything other than making a joke he shouldn't have, per Politico. His company has been sued several times by women who alleged discrimination against women, per the Washington Post, with one saying he fostered a culture of sexual harassment. The candidate said Friday that his company will no longer require confidentiality agreements when facing complaints.  I recognize that NDAs, particularly when they are used in the context of sexual harassment and sexual assault, promote a culture of silence in the workplace and contribute to a culture of women not feeling safe or supported,  Bloomberg said.

The woman, 36-year-old Marie Gemmell—who posted on Facebook today that she just wanted to stay home with her kids, NBC Washington notes—apparently found refuge in a second-floor bathroom with her month-old infant and three-year-old. Officials say they may have died of smoke inhalation from a fire sparked by the crash. Her husband, who was visibly upset at the scene, and their 5-year-old child weren't home when the plane came in low and almost completely blew out the first floor of the house, the AP reports.  He was trying to pull up; he would gain a little elevation and then drop again,  says an eyewitness of the pilot and plane owner, Michael Rosenberg.  And that's when it appeared to have made a dive down into the neighborhood.  Air traffic employees had talked about the number of birds near the airport just before Rosenberg fell off the radar screen, NBC Washington notes,  but it's too early in the investigation to blame a bird strike.  Rosenberg, the CEO of a biopharma corporation, had survived a crash into nearby trees four years ago that totalled his $1.4 million turbo-prop plane. The NTSB blamed him for it, saying he failed  to maintain aircraft control while performing a go-around.  His family says they are  in shock  and  devastated  to learn that others died in today's accident.","Mom, 2 Sons Also Died When Plane Destroyed House"

"(Aug 10, 2008  3:38 PM CDT) Author Susan Squire takes a long view of marriage—about 5,000 years, in fact. Her new book, I Don’t: A Contrarian History of Marriage, traces matrimony’s bizarre historical journey, from pure mating ritual to Christian  lust-containment facility  to modern romance. In an interview with Salon, she says that love had nothing to do with marriage until Martin Luther said it did. In early Christianity, loving one’s wife—or any woman—was  heresy to the church,  Squire says. But codes of conduct for adultery—aka courtly love—elevated commitment to a love object, and in the 16th century, Luther called marriage a holy state of being. Modern husbands and wives may rely overly on romance and sex, but can also be credited with a new marital notion: equality.  We have tried to invert roles that have been set in stone for 4,700 years,  says Squire.  It's going to take a while.","How 5,000 Years of Marriage Led Us to 'I Do'"

First notices of default were sent out on 77,733 houses, a 10% jump from the month before. The numbers  show strong signs that foreclosure activity is coming out of the rain delay we've been in for the past year  following the robo-signing scandal, RealtyTrac’s CEO explained, according to the LA Times. That’s bad news for anyone trying to sell a house, because the glut of foreclosed homes will likely drag prices down further.

"(Apr 18, 2020  5:30 AM CDT) Hospitals in Japan are increasingly turning away sick people as the country struggles with surging coronavirus infections and its emergency medical system collapses. In one recent case, an ambulance carrying a man with a fever and difficulty breathing was rejected by 80 hospitals and forced to search for hours for a hospital in downtown Tokyo that would treat him, per the AP. Another feverish man finally reached a hospital after paramedics unsuccessfully contacted 40 clinics. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine say many hospital ERs are refusing to treat people, including those suffering strokes, heart attacks, and external injuries. Japan initially seemed to have controlled the outbreak by going after clusters of infections in specific places, usually enclosed spaces such as clubs, gyms, and meeting venues. But the spread of virus outpaced this approach, and most new cases are untraceable. The outbreak has highlighted underlying weaknesses in medical care in Japan, which has long been praised for its high-quality insurance system and reasonable costs. Apart from a general unwillingness to embrace social distancing, experts fault government incompetence and a widespread shortage of the protective gear and equipment medical workers need to do their jobs. The  collapse of emergency medicine  has already happened, a precursor to the overall collapse of medicine, the JAAM and the JSEM said in a joint statement. Tokyo's new cases started to spike in late March. They've been rising at an accelerating pace, for a current total of 2,595.

"(Jan 30, 2019  7:12 PM) More than a year and a half later, there are still more questions than answers in the death of Isabella Hellmann, the Miami Herald reports. The 41-year-old and her husband, Lewis Bennett, set out from their South Florida home on a sailing honeymoon, but on their way back to Florida on May 15, 2017, Hellmann disappeared and the boat sank. Bennett long denied any culpability, but in November pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in her death; her body was never found. But at a sentencing hearing Tuesday in Miami, the 41-year-old continued to insist he did not intentionally kill his wife and sink the catamaran to cover up her murder, as prosecutors initially charged him with; his sentencing was ultimately delayed until May due to unresolved issues regarding Hellmann's estate, the Miami Herald reports.  What happened that night with my girl?  Hellman's mother, in Spanish, asked the judge at Tuesday's hearing (Hellmann was a US citizen; her family is from Colombia).  He needs to say what happened,  added Hellman's sister.  She disappeared and that’s it. What happened to her?  All Bennett, who holds dual citizenship from Australia as well as his native Britain, has said is that the boat ran into trouble overnight while Hellman was on watch; a loud noise woke him up and he came above deck to find her gone. He admitted she was not a strong swimmer or sailor yet he did not require her to wear a life jacket or harness, and that he didn't do much to search for her. At Tuesday's hearing, he apologized to her family for his  poor decisions,  the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

"(Jan 9, 2015  7:08 AM) San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge has apparently banked plenty of PTO hours over the last 77 years—and this weekend it's using 52 of them. Starting at midnight tonight and continuing through 4am Monday, the bridge will be closed to cars so that a movable median barrier can be installed along the 1.7-mile span to prevent head-on collisions, the AP reports. It's said to be the iconic bridge's longest shutdown ever and the first closure since the few hours it took off in 1987 for its 50th-anniversary celebration. Golden Gate Transit buses, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and bicyclists will still be allowed, but officials suggest skipping a city visit if possible.  Stay at home,  a bridge district spokeswoman tells the San Francisco Chronicle. About 80,000 drivers cross into San Francisco over the Golden Gate on a typical weekend day, so if all those commuters decide to join the 60,000 drivers who use the nearby Richmond-San Rafael Bridge,  it's going to be a mess,  says the bridge official. The $30 million concrete barrier will take the place of yellow plastic markers currently hand-placed by bridge workers to separate traffic going in opposite directions. Crews will be able to move the new barrier using two special  zipper trucks  to rework the bridge's six lanes as needed, depending on traffic.

In what the News Tribune calls  one of the most heartbreaking  cases in the history of Tacoma, Wash., 60-year-old Robert D. Washburn was arrested Thursday and charged with the murder of 13-year-old Jennifer Bastian, who disappeared during a bike ride in a local park on Aug. 4, 1986. Jennifer's body was found more than three weeks later in what KOMO describes as a  remote area  of Point Defiance Park, and evidence showed she'd been sexually assaulted and strangled. The case soon went cold—until DNA evidence that emerged in 2013 took investigators in a new direction. Even though DNA retrieved from Jennifer's bathing suit didn't initially find a match in national and state registries, there were 2,300 names listed in Jennifer's case paperwork—and investigators decided to ask those who didn't have DNA on file to voluntarily submit to testing. Washburn—who'd once called in a tip on Welch's case and had since moved to Illinois—was one of those names, and in March 2017 he submitted a sample; a match was made and he was arrested in Eureka.

Agents arrested Yaser Abdel Said, 63, in Justin, some 36 miles northwest of Dallas. The Egyptian-born suspect had been sought on a capital murder warrant since the New Year's Day 2008 fatal shootings of the two Lewisville High School students, Sarah Yaser Said, 17, and Amina Yaser Said, 18, the AP reports. He was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2014. A police report says a family member told investigators that the suspect threatened  bodily harm  against Sarah for going on a date with a non-Muslim. The mother, Patricia Said, fled with her daughters in the week before their deaths because she was in  great fear for her life.  Gail Gattrell, the sisters’ great-aunt, has called the deaths an  honor killing,  in which a woman is murdered by a relative to protect her family’s honor.

Yesterday, he told his 120 employees at Gravity Payments in Seattle that over the next three years, he'll gradually raise salaries until everyone in the company is making at least $70,000. It wasn't just the article that convinced him to make his move: He spoke to friends who  walk[ed] me through the math of making 40 grand a year,  he tells the New York Times, and what they said about rent increases and credit card debt  just eats at me inside.  He wanted to put his plan into action without an increase in price or a decrease in service for his customers, so he plans to pay for the salary increases by using up 75% to 80% of the company's profits this year—and by cutting his own salary from almost $1 million to, yes, $70,000. And there it will stay until the company gets back to the same level of profit it had before he made this change, he says. Currently, the average salary at Gravity Payments, which Price founded in 2004 as a 19-year-old Seattle Pacific University student, is $48,000; as part of Price's plan, about 70 employees will see their wages increase—30 will actually see their wages double.

"(Aug 6, 2011  5:40 AM CDT) A helicopter crash in Afghanistan's eastern Wardak province has killed 30 US special operation troops and seven Afghan soldiers, Hamid Karzai said today. (The US figure was revised from 31.) It was the highest number of casualties recorded in a single incident in the decade-long war. NATO confirmed the overnight crash and said it was conducting a recovery operation at the site and investigating the cause of the crash, but did not release details or a casualty figure. The coalition said there  was enemy activity in the area;  a White House official quietly confirmed that the chopper was shot down, reports the AP. A spokesman for Wardak province said the helicopter crashed in the Sayd Abad district of Wardak province. The volatile region borders Kabul province, and is known for its strong Taliban presence. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed the downed aircraft was a US military helicopter and that the Taliban fighters had brought it down with a rocket attack. In a statement, Mujahid said that NATO attacked a house in Sayd Abad where insurgent fighters were gathering last night. Mujahid said the Taliban fired on NATO and downed the helicopter, killing all the crew. He said eight insurgents also died. At NATO headquarters in Brussels, an official said it was a twin-rotor Chinook helicopter. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was receiving his information from an Afghan officer in Kabul.",30 US Troops Die in Afghan Chopper Crash
"(May 20, 2015  7:35 AM CDT) Officials have followed through with their vow to double the search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Though just 75% of the initial 23,000-square-mile search zone has been scoured, a statement today says the area has now expanded to 46,000 square miles—about the size of Pennsylvania—in the southern Indian Ocean, NBC News reports.  The search into the expanded area has already commenced, with search efforts focused in the south to take advantage of the last of the usable weather in that area,  the Australian Transport Safety Bureau says. As winter weather in the area will make the search difficult,  the search plan has been modified to enable continuous search operations during winter and to ensure that the entire area is searched as quickly and effectively as possible.  The new search area, based on satellite data and pings from the plane, offers the  highest probability  of finding the Boeing 777, officials say.  Beyond that, it is not possible to refine the search area to one of greater likelihood.  Search crews received a boost of confidence with the discovery of a shipwreck last week because it meant their technology was working, Popular Mechanics reports. However, the robot crucial to that find will be shelved until weather improves, meaning the search could slow. A rep for the National Transportation Safety Board says it's unlikely the search would be abandoned even if the plane isn't found in the new area.  This is so important, not to mention a matter of national pride  to Australia, Malaysia, and China, he says.  It's a big ocean, but I think they will find some wreckage at some point.",MH370 Search Area Now the Size of Pennsylvania
"(Nov 6, 2018  9:45 AM) More than 200 mass graves containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies have been found in Iraq from the time of the Islamic State group's three-year reign, UN investigators said Tuesday. The 202 graves verified by investigators dot northern Iraq and are a  legacy of (ISIS') terror,  according to a joint report by the UN mission to Iraq and the UN office for human rights. Findings from the gravesites can be used as evidence of the group's crimes, they said. The graves date from 2014 to 2017, when the militant group ruled some of Iraq's largest cities and towns. As the militants swept through Iraq and neighboring Syria, they killed captured members of the security forces en masse, expelled or killed minorities, and enslaved women from the Yazidi sect.

"(Jun 14, 2014  6:52 AM CDT) The planet we're living on is about 60 million years older than previously thought. So say scientists in France who studied quartz from Australia and South Africa that dates back about 3 billion years, reports Phys.org. The ratio of gases in the quartz compared to today's ratios suggest both the Earth and the moon were created about 40 million years after the formation of the solar system, rather than the previous estimate of 100 million years afterward. That's likely when a collision happened that left behind Earth as we know it—and formed the moon, the Huffington Post explains. At that time, experts think, an object the size of Mars smashed into the predecessor of our planet, the Los Angeles Times reports. That collision created Earth's atmosphere, while the resulting debris formed the moon.  The gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of 'time capsule,'  says a scientist from the University of Lorraine.  We are using standard methods to compute the age of the Earth, but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data.

"(Oct 25, 2017  6:03 AM CDT) You really can put a price on happiness, or at least Albert Einstein's pithy theory on the matter: The theory, scribbled on a piece of paper and handed to a messenger, sold at auction for $1.56 million, AFP reports. The record-setting bid at Tuesday's sale in Jerusalem far surpassed estimates of $5,000 to $8,000, per Winner's auction house. Einstein scrawled the note on Imperial Hotel Tokyo stationery in 1922 while on a tour of Japan after being informed he'd won the Nobel Prize for physics. It reads in German:  A calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it,  per the BBC. The physicist better known for another theory gave the note to a courier who made a delivery to his room. Einstein didn't want the man to leave empty-handed, so instead of a tip he handed him two notes, the anonymous seller tells AFP. The second missive, which sold for $240,000, was less original.  Where there’s a will, there’s a way,  it reads.  Maybe if you’re lucky those notes will become much more valuable than just a regular tip,  Einstein told the man, says the seller, a relative of the courier who lives in Hamburg, Germany. The auction house says the buyer was a European who wants to remain anonymous, per the BBC. Two other letters Einstein wrote later were also auctioned, fetching prices of $33,600 and $9,600, per AFP.

It was all a sting set up by federal agents, however. The indictment described 48-year-old Joseph Hunter, also known as  Rambo,  as a contract killer and leader of the group of ex-snipers. Hunter, now a resident of Thailand, was to appear in court in New York City tomorrow. According to the court papers, undercover operators promised Hunter in March that his security team would be protecting thousands of kilos of marijuana and would be seeing  tons of cocaine and millions of dollars.  Audio and video recordings of the meeting show Hunter discussing  bonus jobs  of contract killings, saying the men he had recruited want to do as much  bonus  work as possible, the indictment said.

"(Aug 27, 2017  3:00 PM CDT) Tobe Hooper, the horror-movie pioneer whose low-budget sensation The Texas Chain Saw Massacre took a buzz saw to audiences with its brutally frightful vision, has died. He was 74. The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Sunday said Hooper died Saturday in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. It was reported as a natural death. Along with contemporaries like George Romero and John Carpenter, Hooper crafted some of the scariest nightmares that ever haunted moviegoers, the AP reports. Hooper directed 1982's Poltergeist from a script by Steven Spielberg, and helmed the well-regarded 1979 miniseries Salem's Lot, from Stephen King's novel. Hooper was a little-known filmmaker of documentaries and TV commercials when he made his most famous work: 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He made it for less than $300,000 in his native Texas, and yet it became one the most influential films in horror: a slasher film landmark.  I had never seen anything like it and I wanted to see it myself,  said Hooper in 2014. The film was controversial. Several countries banned it, though the independent film — aided by its gory reputation and lightning fast word-of-mouth — grossed $30.8 million, playing for eight years in drive-ins and theaters. Halloween director John Carpenter on Sunday called it  a seminal work in horror cinema,  while William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, recalled Hooper as  a kind, warm-hearted man who made the most terrifying film ever.  Hooper's last film as director was 2013's Djinn, a supernatural thriller set in the United Arab Emirates.",'Poltergeist' Director Tobe Hooper Dies at 74

Keisha Richburg was investigated after Jamel Harris was shot in the head June 19, CBS 46 reports. A passerby, Leilani Collier, found Harris lying in the street and stopped to help; she looked in his wallet to find his ID, and later turned the wallet—which had the $500 cash in it—over to police. Collier told Harris' widow about the money, but when police gave Lanique Harris the wallet, they told her there was no money in it, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The administrative investigation did not determine whether Richburg took the money, but she was fired Monday for failing to account for it.  An administrative investigation was not able to determine what happened to the cash, but Officer Richburg did not properly account for the money according to the department's policies and procedures,  says a statement from the police department.  As a result, she was terminated.  Adds Police Chief Erika Shields,  Officer integrity goes to the heart of what we do here every single day.

But the 20-something singer, whose star turn showed her stripped down to her skivvies and provocatively eating fruit, lives in Egypt, and the conservative powers-that-be there have sentenced her to prison, the BBC reports. Shyma (real name: Shaimaa Ahmed) was arrested in November, and on Tuesday she was handed a two-year sentence on charges of debauchery and publishing an indecent film, per local media. The New York Daily News says Mohamed Gamal, the director of the video, called  I Have Issues,  was also sentenced to two years in prison in absentia. The Telegraph offers more details, explaining that in the video, Shyma appears in her underwear, then noshes on a milk-drizzled banana, licks an apple, and samples cake icing in front of a classroom of beguiled men. The video got her more than 1 million followers, but then came her arrest. The debauchery charge isn't an uncommon one in Egypt, with media reports citing instances of women being thrown behind bars for dancing in music videos (that recently earned belly dancers six months each in prison) and, in the case of a singer who proclaimed on film that sipping Nile River water could get people sick,  spreading provocative publicity.  As for Shyma, she noted before her arrest in a Facebook post that's since disappeared that she was sorry for her  inappropriate  behavior and  didn't imagine ... that I would be subjected to such a strong attack from everyone.

That doesn't include those who used to the site to find out if they qualify for Medicaid, or those who used state-based enrollment websites. A new report estimates another 49,000 have enrolled through the latter.

Now their nightmare has doubled: Darryl's 18-year-old brother, Ryan, was killed by a hit-and-run driver over the weekend near the college where he was a freshman, the Detroit News reports. Ryan and Darryl were Paul and Julie Tsatsos' only children, the paper notes.  No arrests have been made yet in the death of Ryan Tsatsos,  a Michigan State Police rep said Monday.  We are following up on tips. We are aware that the family lost their other son three months ago. This is a terribly tragic situation.  Their ongoing nightmare started in the early hours of July 26, after a deputy tried to pull Darryl over for speeding, the News reports. Even though the officer eventually gave up the chase, a few minutes later he came upon an accident scene, where Darryl's car had slammed into two other vehicles, killing Darryl (the other drivers weren't seriously injured). In Ryan's case, he was walking with friends early Sunday near Central Michigan University when a car plowed into him going as fast as 80mph, throwing him 30 feet into a ditch, WJBK reports.

"(Feb 9, 2017  12:56 PM) A 7-year-old boy in California already has $10,000 saved for college—and not a penny of it came from his parents.  I've recycled 200,000 cans and bottles,  Ryan Hickman tells ABC7. He got  hooked  on recycling at age 3 after a visit to a recycling center.  He really loved the actual act of putting all the cans and bottles into the machine and getting the money for it,  his father says. Ryan then started asking friends and neighbors to save their recyclables for him. Today, he runs Ryan's Recycling out of San Juan Capistrano with customers across Orange County, according to his website. With help from family members, Ryan picks up and sorts plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans and cleans out  yucky liquids  to prepare them for recycling. His parents then take the recyclables to a recycling center.  The recycling money I'm saving for a garbage truck,  says Ryan, who was also gifted $10,000 and a miniature recycling truck on a recent appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, per the Capistrano Dispatch. But his parents stress that the money is actually being set aside for his education. Not all of the money coming in is being kept for Ryan, though. He also sells T-shirts with proceeds donated to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach  for the sea lions to get food and medicine,  Ryan says. His advice:  If you don't recycle, start recycling —and the reason is simple.  It helps the world,  Ryan tells the Dispatch.

"(Apr 30, 2014  3:20 PM CDT) Al Feldstein, whose 28 years at the helm of Mad magazine transformed the satirical publication into a pop culture institution, has died at his Montana home at age 88. In 1956, publisher William M. Gaines put Feldstein in charge of the magazine, which gleefully parodied politicians and mocked traditional morality. Feldstein and Gaines assembled a pool of artists and writers who turned out such enduring features as  Spy vs. Spy,  ''The Lighter Side of...  and  Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.  Building on a character used by Mad founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Feldstein turned the freckle-faced Alfred E. Neuman into an underground hero—a dimwitted everyman with a gap-toothed smile and the recurring stock phrase,  What, Me Worry?  Under Gaines and Feldstein, Mad's sales flourished, topping 2 million in the early 1970s. In a 1997 interview with the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Feldstein credited Mad's challenges to authority with helping incite the cultural revolution of the 1960s.  Who's covering up? That was one of our slogans,  he said.  We were orienting them to the adult world.

Rolling Stone reports that an attendee/survivor has filed a $100 million class-action lawsuit against festival creators Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, aka Jeffrey Atkins. The complaint ticks off a by-now familiar litany of complaints about the supposedly luxurious getaway in the Bahamas that saw everything that could go wrong do so in spectacular fashion. And one big problem for McFarland and Ja Rule is that their well-heeled clientele can afford big-name lawyers.  The festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees—suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions—that was closer to The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,  the lawsuit states.

"(Feb 21, 2020  4:30 PM) Wells Fargo agreed Friday to pay the government $3 billion to settle investigations into a series of abuses that went on for years, including opening accounts for customers without their approval. The deal wraps up federal civil and criminal cases, the Wall Street Journal reports, though criminal charges could be pursued if the bank doesn't stick to its agreement, which includes cooperating with investigations for another three years. Wells Fargo makes a series of admissions in the settlement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, per the Washington Post. The bank admits to taking millions of dollars in fees through the falsification of records and forging of signatures by thousands of its employees. Personal data of customers was  unlawfully misused,  the agreement says, to help the bank reach sales goals—and sometimes to keep the customers from learning about the unauthorized accounts.  This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within  the bank, said Nick Hanna, US attorney for central California.  Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way.  The fine equals about 15% of the bank's profits last year. Wells Fargo is still one of the nation's largest and most profitable banks, but it has been in decline since the scandals surfaced in 2016. It still has issues with regulators; the Federal Reserve has slapped a cap on the bank's growth. Prosecutors said top executives knew of the abuses as far back as 2002.

Americans plan to spend a whopping $6.9 billion on costumes, decorations, and entertainment related to October 31, according to the National Retail Federation—and that’s more than double 2005’s number from the same survey, $3.3 billion.

Of this year’s planned expenditures, about $2.5 billion will go to costumes for people, $2 billion to candy, $2 billion to decorations, and more than $300 million to costumes for pets. Despite the fact that we spend much more on Christmas and other end-of-the-year holidays ($447 billion was last year’s projection), that number is not growing nearly as quickly.

That's according to two Italian newspapers, which report that among the swag handed out to guests were USB sticks and cellphone recharging cables that were actually surveillance tools.  They were Trojan horses designed to obtain information from computers and cellphones,  La Stampa reported, per the LA Times. The papers say the true nature of the gadgets was discovered after the president of the European Council ordered an investigation into them. The Telegraph reports that David Cameron, at least, did not receive one of the covert spy tools.  My understanding is that the prime minister didn't receive a USB drive because I think they were a gift for delegates, not for leaders,  his spokesman says.

Barbour, who left office Tuesday, remained defiant, issuing a statement defending the pardons:  The pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote,  he said, adding that more than 90% of convicts had already been released when the pardons were issued.

A later NYPD lab test determined that their red and blue  crystalline rocks of solid material  were, in fact, candy.

He wrote it over the course of nearly two years spent at Dachau, a feat managed in part because of the job he was assigned as an office manager at a screw factory, which  provided him clandestine opportunities to keep a secret diary,  writes David Chrisinger for the New York Times Magazine, which highlights the diary as part of a series telling  lesser-known stories  from World War II. Kupfer-Koberwitz documented everything he could about the horrors of  a satanic world  in the diary, which he hid from guards in a wooden box with a false bottom. Once it was too large for even the box, he and a co-worker dug a hole in the factory's concrete floor in October 1944 and buried it, digging it out a week after Dachau was liberated. It is one of only a small number of surviving testimonies to have been written inside a German concentration camp. Most of those that do exist are in pieces and  almost none show Edgar's extraordinary powers of observation,  per Chrisinger. And  no detail was too small or too cruel for him to preserve.  It describes, for instance, the use of a torture device in which victims were hung  from the arms that are twisted backward,  per the Knoxville Daily Sun.  These are the torments of hell!

"(Feb 19, 2020  6:13 AM) China has yanked the press credentials of three Beijing-based Wall Street Journal reporters in retaliation for a Feb. 3 opinion piece published by the paper, per the country's foreign ministry. The Wall Street Journal reports the three have been given five days to exit the country. The offending opinion piece was headlined  China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia,  and the uproar from the foreign ministry and state-media outlets came quickly. A ministry rep on Wednesday said  the Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks.  He demanded a public apology and said the paper must  punish those responsible,  reports the New York Times. CNN reports it marks the first time since 1989 that multiple foreign journalists have been expelled at the same time, and the first expulsion of a foreign correspondent in general in 22 years. The three are Deputy Bureau Chief Josh Chin and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen; all work in news, which has no interaction with the paper's opinion operation. As for the offending phrase in the headline of the piece, which was written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead and touched on the coronavirus epidemic, the Journal reports it  was used by both outsiders and Chinese intellectuals to refer to a weakened China’s exploitation by European powers and Japan in the late 1800s and early 1900s.",China's Retaliation Against WSJ a First Since 1989

Amber Guyger didn't appear to show much reaction, at least from the angle of a live camera stream, as the judge read the jury's sentence. It came a day after the jury convicted her of murder in the September 2018 killing of Botham Jean. Guyger’s sentence was met with boos and jeers by a crowd gathered outside the courtroom.  It's a slap in the face,  one woman said. The basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial.

"(Jan 25, 2017  10:17 AM) Scratch that: Outlets including the BBC and the AP reported that Madonna had applied to adopt two children in Malawi, but the Material Girl has since refuted those reports.  I am in Malawi to check on the children's hospital in Blantyre and my other work with Raising Malawi, and then heading home,  she tells Us.  The rumors of an adoption process are untrue.  Madonna, 58, flew into Malawi on Tuesday and a government spokesperson had confirmed to the aforementioned news outlets that she appeared in High Court in the country's capital on Wednesday. Citing local reports, the Telegraph said she was seen carrying one child after the hearing, while another person from her group carried a second child.

"(Apr 13, 2015  11:09 AM CDT) Underlining a change across the nation, nearly nine out of 10 adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive survey released today. As recently as 2013, slightly more than eight out of 10 had coverage. Whether the new number from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index turns out to be a high-water mark for President Obama's health care law, or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all US residents covered, remains to be seen. The law's future is still up in the air and will hinge on factors ranging from an upcoming Supreme Court decision on consumer subsidies to actions by Republican leaders in states opposed to Medicaid expansion. The Gallup-Healthways survey found that the share of adults who lack insurance dropped to 11.9% for the first three months of this year, the lowest level since that survey began its tracking in 2008. Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall, before open enrollment got underway, according to Gallup.  The Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve health,  says the research director for the poll.  The first one is clearly a win. Coverage is increasing; there is no question about it.  On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since fall 2013, when the first open enrollment was about to begin, according to Gallup.",Almost 90% of US Adults Now Have Health Insurance

"(Dec 19, 2017  2:40 PM) A 92-year-old hunter in Virginia had to spend a frigid night in the woods, but he's safe now thanks to quick work by a drone. Bill McDonnell went out hunting Saturday in Shenandoah County, and his family notified authorities when he hadn't emerged from the woods by that evening, reports the Washington Post. Rescuers had a general sense of where he was thanks to a phone call he'd made to his family, but a search involving helicopters and foot patrols proved fruitless through the night. Enter the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, whose search-and-rescue team arrived on the scene Sunday morning, dispatched a relatively new drone at 9:30am, and located McDonnell a mere 20 minutes later. Rescuers on foot then found him and escorted him back to safety, and he's fine.  All of a sudden it got dark on me,  he explains.  I couldn’t see my hands in front of my face. I couldn't go forwards, I couldn't go backwards, I couldn't go left, I couldn't go right or any place. It was worse than the jungle.  As WJLA notes, McDonnell is a World War II vet who spent his share of nights sleeping outside during the war. Temperatures dipped into the 20s Saturday night, but McDonnell had dressed warmly, packed food, and made himself a bed in twigs and leaves. He adds that his son made him promise not to go hunting alone anymore. The Post provides another nugget: The drone is just the sixth in the nation that flies in the Project Lifesaver program—it has a special antenna designed to locate people with medical conditions such as Alzheimer's who are wearing a specific wristband. In this case, however, McDonnell wasn't a participant in that program.

Lil Peep, whose real name was Gustav Ahr and whose stage name came from a childhood nickname his mother gave him, didn't take the stage during his scheduled concert in Tucson, Ariz., on Wednesday night. TMZ reports he was found dead in his tour bus outside the venue and that it's possible he overdosed. The Guardian reports that shortly before his death, the rapper posted a video to Instagram talking about taking six Xanax. In a statement, First Access Entertainment CEO Sarah Stennett says she is  shocked and heartbroken.  Stennett says she spoke with Ahr's mother, who asked her to convey  that she is very, very proud of him and everything he was able to achieve in his short life.  Ahr's emotional, downtrodden lyrics gained a cult following through a series of mixtapes released online; the New York Times says he  blended hip-hop and emo  and was one of the most promising young stars on the pop scene. Born in Pennsylvania and raised on Long Island, he eventually moved to Los Angeles and joined several rap collectives, Pitchfork reports. He released his debut project on SoundCloud in 2015 and went on to release mixtapes and videos that got millions of views. Many of his songs were recorded in his bedroom while he lived on LA's Skid Row; his lyrics often addressed his struggles with drug use and suicidal thoughts.

According to Bloomberg, the US Marshals Service was selling the items—seized during Bulger's capture in 2011 after 16 years on the run—to benefit his victims. More than 250  mafia history enthusiasts  and others turned out to bid. The items included a rat-shaped pen holder (fetched $3,600), the white bucket hat Bulger was wearing when he was arrested ($6,400), the newspaper he was reading right before his capture ($500), and a replica of the 1986 Stanley Cup Champions ring ($9,100). That ring was the only belonging Bulger fought with authorities to keep. But the auction also included more mundane items, Reuters reports. A punching bag, a floor safe, books on WWII with Bulger's handwritten notes, and a collection of sneakers ( You can walk in Whitey's shoes,  says the auctioneer). A  lumpy old couch  was bought for $35. Left out of the auction were Bulger's toiletries, underwear, and Nazi memorabilia. The money brought in at the auction, combined with $800,000 in cash Bulger had on him during his arrest, is still far short of the $25 million he owes his victims.

"(Jan 4, 2012  7:54 AM) Scientists say there's a simple way to minimize the risk that the natural gas extraction technique known as  fracking  will cause earthquakes—like the one that hit Ohio on New Year's. But there’s a catch: It costs $10 million per injection well, a price the energy industry isn’t likely to pony up gladly, Reuters reports. It's not the actual fracking, but the disposal of contaminated fluids—which are typically pumped deep into the Earth—that seems to be causing the quakes. So seismologists say that if companies conducted a thorough seismic survey before pumping drilling fluid into the ground, they could make sure it’s not going to hit quake-prone areas. But the process is both more costly and more involved than the oil companies’ usual method of drilling a bore hole to collect a limited rock sample, and companies aren’t likely to do more until the link between fracking and earthquakes is definitively proven. It hasn’t been yet, but the evidence is strong: Every region where fracking has taken off has seen quakes increase tenfold.",Fracking Quakes Could Be Avoided ... for $10M Per Well

He'd been flying a DC-10 jet from Denver to Chicago when the plane experienced a failure of its tail-mounted engine some 75 miles north of Sioux City. Many flight controls were lost as shrapnel cut hydraulic lines. But Haynes and crew members kept the plane in the air, alternating thrust to both engines, for more than 40 minutes until reaching Sioux City's Gateway Airport.

"(Oct 7, 2018  2:30 PM CDT) A rare condition known for its polio-like effects has been diagnosed in six Minnesota children since mid-September. Per CNN, the condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, and damages the body's nervous system. While uncommon, AFM is serious and can lead to paralysis or even death. The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the Star-Tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, AFM's more elusive cause means there is no vaccine.  Disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases,  the Minnesota Department of Public Health said in a statement.  The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information.  AFM most commonly affects young children and the cases in Minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. AFM is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of AFM, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren't permanent. (Meanwhile, the CDC says the disease may be on the rise.)",Rare Polio-Like Illness Strikes 6 Minnesota Children

Instant moon dust—for $35,000 a ton.  It's as good as it gets,  a project chief says.",NASA's $19M Mission: Simulating Messy Moon Dust
"(Nov 11, 2010  1:30 PM) Donata Forman really loves her dog. So when her condo board told her little Charlie—a four-pound Yorkshire terrier— had to go,  I said, I’m going all the way  with the case, Forman tells the New York Daily News.  I need him because he’s part of the family.  Forman took the condo board to court, and dragged them through a costly legal battle—which she won this week. So rejoice, pooch lovers, because an appeals court ruled that a pet ban can only be instituted if it is written into the condo’s bylaws and approved by 80% of the owners who live there. The condo board is probably pretty chagrined; Forman at one point offered to settle, but they turned her down.  They told a judge that they’d spent $100,000 already, so they can’t settle,  says Forman’s lawyer.",Condo Spends $100K Trying to Evict Dog ... and Loses
"(Mar 18, 2016  8:49 AM CDT) An Arizona woman has been awarded $125,000 after an officer entered her home illegally and arrested her while she was naked. The Chandler City Council OKed the settlement Thursday, per the Arizona Republic. Esmeralda Rossi says she spoke briefly to Officer Doug Rose at her door in March 2015 when he responded to a domestic-disturbance call related to an argument with her now-ex husband; Rossi had been showering when he arrived. Wearing only a towel, Rossi asked Rose to wait and closed the door, per ABC15.  I probably get about five steps in, and all of a sudden, I just hear boots running in after me, telling me 'stop or I’ll arrest you,'  she says. At that point, Rossi's teen daughter began filming the exchange. An internal investigation found Rose did follow Rossi inside without cause, grabbed her arm, and put her in handcuffs. Police say Rose's incident report didn't mention that Rossi was arrested in her home (and subsequently unarrested), was naked, or that any force was used. He retired during the course of the investigation.",Woman Arrested While Nude Is Now $125K Richer
"(Dec 16, 2020  1:27 PM) A Kenyan man has been indicted in a case that  eerily draws parallels  to the 9/11 attacks, the Department of Justice says. Cholo Abdi Abdullah  obtained pilot training in the Philippines in preparation for seeking to hijack a commercial aircraft and crash it into a building in the United States,  according to a newly unsealed federal indictment. Abdullah was arrested last year in the Philippines, where he had spent years training as a pilot and completed the necessary tests for a pilot's license, the New York Times reports. Prosecutors say the 30-year-old was taking orders from a commander in al-Shabab, a group that has sworn allegiance to al-Qaeda. Abdullah allegedly researched aircraft security issues including methods of hijacking a plane, information on the tallest building in an unnamed major US city, and how to obtain a US visa. After his July 2019 arrest, Philippine authorities said Abdullah had pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2012. They said firearms and explosives were found at his residence. Abdullah was transported from the Philippines to the US Tuesday and entered a not guilty plea in a federal court in Manhattan Wednesday, NBC New York reports. He is being held without bail and faces a potential sentence of 20 years to life.","Feds: Man Trained as Pilot, Planned 9/11-Style Attack"

"(May 4, 2014  4:23 PM CDT) A California woman who recently moved to Maui died Thursday morning when she plunged 150 feet from a zipline, Hawaii News Now reports. Rescuers struggled to find Patricia Rabellizsa, 29, among the vegetation, tree cover, and difficult terrain found in the area of Makawao.  Where the ziplines are, they go through the gulches, so it made it kinda difficult,  said a Maui Fire spokesman.  Where the body was—where the lady fell—we couldn't access it with the helicopters so they had to carry her off to the side.  Rabellizsa, a zipline worker, was dead on the scene. Her fall has revived talk about regulating Hawaii's zipline industry to protect worker safety—an effort that died in the state legislature two years ago, KHON2 reports. At the time, the state auditor found no evidence of  harm or abusive practices  in the zipline business (see the report here). State Rep. Mark Nakashima, who introduced the bill, says Rabellizsa's death may be  what it takes to get interest from the legislature.  But the owner of Piiholo Ranch Zipline—where Rabellizsa worked and died—says his business follows safety guidelines and does  major inspections  twice a year.

"(Apr 19, 2017  4:18 PM CDT) Prosecutors in Massachusetts moved to throw out more than 21,000 drug convictions on Tuesday, five years after a chemist at the state drug lab was caught tampering with evidence and falsifying tests, the AP reports. The state's highest court had ordered district attorneys in seven counties to produce lists by Tuesday indicating how many of approximately 24,000 cases involving Annie Dookhan they would be unable or unwilling to prosecute if the defendants were granted new trials. The ACLU said Tuesday night that 21,587 cases had been recommended for dismissal. It said that would be the largest dismissal of criminal convictions in US history. The cases would be formally dismissed by court action, expected Thursday, the ACLU said. Dookhan pleaded guilty in 2013 to obstruction of justice, perjury, and tampering with evidence after being accused of falsifying her work as far back as 2004. Prosecutors said Dookhan admitted testing only a fraction of a batch of samples, then listing them all as positive for illegal drugs. Her motive, they said, was to boost her productivity and burnish her reputation. She was sentenced to three years in prison and was paroled last year. Many of the drug case defendants have already completed their sentences, though some probably remain in prison because of other charges not contaminated by the lab scandal.

He appeared in a long string of TV shows and movies, including Lassie and Bonanza, though his performance as Stringfellow  String  Hawke on Airwolf was his most famous role.

"(Jul 16, 2019  4:24 PM CDT) Bad welds in 2,100 new Legacy sedans and Outback SUVs have led Subaru to decide to scrap the vehicles rather than try to repair them. Most of the defective models haven't been delivered yet, but at least 20 US purchasers will have the option of having Suburu replace their new vehicle or buy it back, per NBC. The automaker said that a supplier didn't clean part of its machinery properly, which reduced the effectiveness of a welder used to join sheet metal components in cowls. Over time, the welds on the cowl, which separates the engine from the passenger compartment, could fail. That could lead to an accident, the Japanese automaker said, and make injuries to occupants more likely. A body shop employee spotted the weld problem on June 6, per the International Business Times. Subaru then launched an internal investigation. The 1,965 Outback and 142 Legacy models affected were made between May 31 and June 6. The Legacy starts at about $22,000, and the Outback at about $26,000, per NBC. With options, both models can cost nearly $40,000.

A female mouse was involved, of course—researchers engineered one whose eggs contained only DNA from a male, then mated her with another male—but genetically the mice have two fathers. Scientists touted the procedure as  a new form of mammalian reproduction,  though the Wall Street Journal says that its  practical benefits are far from clear.   It has been a weird project, but we wanted to see if it could be done,  says the study’s lead author. To make it work, scientists took cells from a male mouse, turned them into something similar to embryonic stem cells, and then grew copies in a cell line until a small number—about 1%—spontaneously lost their Y chromosome.

Created to improve on the company's already exceptional mattresses, some of which have lasted more than 100 years, it's now being updated a decade of research and work later. The new Vividus takes 320 hours to make and will set you back $149,000, reports Bloomberg. The bed consists of a wooden frame made of slow-growth northern Swedish pine; a box spring of pure steel springs with layers of cotton, wool batting, and horsehair; and a mattress pad that has its own layers of cotton, wool, and horsehair, each hair braided by hand and then unwound to maximize bounce. Why horsehair? Its strands are hollow, so it naturally wicks away moisture.

"(Oct 21, 2015  8:11 AM CDT) A US Navy pilot was killed when his F-18 jet crashed in farmland in eastern England, just a few miles from the US Air Force base it had departed, on Wednesday morning.  A military aircraft which had taken off from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk came down at about 10:30am  local time, a police rep tells Reuters.  We can confirm one fatality and believe there was just one person on board the aircraft.  Sources tell the BBC and Guardian that the F-18 was one of six Marine Corps planes returning to the US from the Middle East, which landed at Lakenheath, about 70 miles north of London, over the weekend. Four planes reportedly departed the base on Wednesday, but one failed to meet up with a waiting fuel tanker.  I was outside in my shed and heard an aircraft coming over. All of a sudden all hell broke loose,  a man who lives near the crash site tells the Cambridge News.  The noise was terrible—I've never heard that before.  The man says he then saw a  massive fireball  through the fog.  The flames were huge. There was no way anyone was getting out of that alive. It's certainly not the sort of thing you expect on your doorstep.  Another witness tells the BBC the plane was flying low immediately before the crash, and she praised the pilot because he  took the plane away from the houses, which was brilliant.",US F-18 Pilot Dead in 'Fireball' Crash

"(Aug 8, 2013  7:30 AM CDT) Now that the Supreme Court has overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, the Pentagon is reviewing a plan that would extend full marriage benefits to same-sex couples by the end of this month, according to a draft memo from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlining the proposal obtained yesterday by the AP. In the process, the Defense Department would ditch a previous plan that would have allowed unmarried same-sex couples access to some limited benefits after signing a declaration form. Now, troops will actually need to be legally married to get the benefits, but the military will give them 10 days of leave so they can travel to a state where gay marriage is legal and tie the knot. In the memo, Hagel says that the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that  the spousal and family benefits far outweigh the benefits that could be extended under a declaration system.

"(Apr 14, 2014  7:22 AM CDT) A massive explosion ripped through a busy commuter bus station on the outskirts of Nigeria's capital of Abuja this morning, leaving 71 dead and 124 wounded, according to police. Reporters saw rescue workers and police gathering body parts, as well as ambulances rushing the wounded to the hospital. The blast, which appeared to come from a vehicle, ripped a four-foot hole in the ground and destroyed more than 30 other vehicles, causing secondary explosions as their fuel tanks ignited and burned.  It affected quite a number of people because it was still very early in the morning and there was a lot of traffic,  one emergency official said. No group has yet claimed responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell on the Boko Haram terrorist network, which typically operates far from Abuja but has been threatening to hit the capital.

"(Jun 13, 2015  3:00 PM CDT) The American Red Cross raised nearly $500 million after Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake, but what happened to the money? According to an NPR and Pro Publica report, the organization claims to have provided 130,000 people with homes but in fact built only six permanent homes. The Red Cross says land-rights issues hindered its efforts, but reporters found other problems, like lengthy bureaucratic delays, changes in staffing, and a full year in which nothing happened.  They never had a real plan for what they wanted to do in housing,  says Lee Malany, who was in charge of the organization's Haiti shelter program. He says Red Cross leadership, including CEO Gail McGovern, seemed more concerned with publicity than project details. NPR and Pro Publica look at the struggling Haitian community of Campeche, part of a Port-au-Prince neighborhood where the Red Cross promised to spent $24 million on rebuilding—but residents say it never happened. The Red Cross reacted with an email that accused reporters of  creating ill will in the community, which may give rise to a security incident.

As recounted by a Pakistani police report, Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah revealed that two of the children were born in government hospitals, and these new details have the New York Times wondering how her husband was able to traverse the country with family in tow without being caught by Pakistani's powerful security forces. The bin Laden family split up after 9/11, but Abdulfattah joined her husband in the Pakistani city of Peshawar in 2002, she said. The family hid in rural northwest Pakistan, not far from Islamabad, though not in the tribal regions where Western authorities were searching. In 2003, they moved to Haripur, nearer to Islamabad, where Abdulfattah had two children in government hospitals, apparently under a fake name.

That day came this week, a quarter century after Larson officially retired the quirky cartoon, the New York Times reports. On TheFarSide.com website, fans are treated to a handful of signature single-panel Larsons (we don't want to give too much away, but they involve a taxidermist, bears, aliens, and Cub Scouts, among other things), but with a twist: Larson created the new cartoons in an entirely different way than he used to.  The 'New Stuff' that you'll see here is the result of my journey into the world of digital art,  he says on his site, explaining that a clogged pen that was frustrating him while penning Christmas cards a few years ago led to him experimenting with a digital tablet.  I hail from a world of pen and ink, and suddenly I was feeling like I was sitting at the controls of a 747,  he says of his digital experience. Larson—who launched the strip on Jan. 1, 1980, in the San Francisco Chronicle and kept inking it until he retired in 1995—had recently rebooted his website, featuring classic  Far Side  strips that CNET describes as  [depicting] the ludicrous sides of humanity, as well as the secret lives of animals—often cows.

"(Oct 18, 2014  3:36 PM CDT) Six different people were involved in a complicated plot to take ownership of a dead woman's home and car, police say. It started with one Romanoff Quarles, 43, of Philadelphia; he had his eye on the property of his neighbor Dorothy Kennedy, who had died with no heirs in 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Kennedy's home and car were legally supposed to go to the state, but Quarles' lawyer, Andrew Kaufman, 56, came up with  a scheme that would allow Quarles to unlawfully exploit the system,  police say. The plot reportedly went like this: Quarles would try to become the estate's administrator by pretending he'd supported Kennedy. That involved noting fake errands he'd run for her on old calendars. Meanwhile, Quarles buried Kennedy, with help from a former funeral home owner as well as chapel owner Antoine Turay. Turay provided Quarles with a bill for $7,000, though the burial had actually cost $1,400; that bill served as documentation as Quarles sought to become the estate's administrator. A real estate broker set up a false sale of Kennedy's home to Quarles, who obtained it in 2012, and an auto businessman helped give Quarles the car title. An anonymous caller finally revealed the story to police, the Inquirer reports.

"(Mar 30, 2018  7:03 AM CDT) It's the stuff sports dreams are made of. A hockey player who has never played professionally—he usually shows off his talents in a beer league—not only took the ice for an actual NHL game Thursday but emerged the shining star. Scott Foster, a 36-year-old accountant who played hockey for Western Michigan University in the early to mid-2000s, was acting as the emergency back-up goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks Thursday. Foster had filled this role for about a dozen other games this season, which mostly meant enjoying free food in the United Center press box. This time would be different. Starting goaltender Anton Forsberg suffered a season-ending injury during practice, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Six minutes into the third period of Thursday's game against the Winnipeg Jets, back-up goalie Collin Delia was injured, too.  The initial shock happened when I had to dress,  says Foster.  And then I think you just kind of black out after that.  Apparently blacking out is a good strategy. Foster made his first save after only a minute, reports the AP. With the crowd chanting his name, the father of two went on to stop all seven shots he faced over 14 minutes and one second, for a 6-2 Blackhawks victory.  Foster emerged a hockey legend, delivering a performance that left everyone who watched it in awe,  as the Washington Post puts it. For his trouble, Foster was named player of the game and No. 1 star.  Who would have thought? You just keep grinding away in men's league and eventually you get your shot,  Foster said after the big game.  This is something that no one can ever take away from me.

The space rock, named 2011 MD, was over the south Atlantic near Antarctica at the time of its closest approach, reports the Christian Science Monitor. The asteroid was only spotted a few days ago, but experts say it was too small to have survived entering Earth's atmosphere even if it was on a path to score a direct hit. The asteroid, which had been in an orbit around the sun so Earth-like that astronomers initially thought it was a piece of space junk, was sent off on a new trajectory through the solar system by its close brush with Earth.

The last imprisoned members of the  Cuban Five  spy ring were freed this week in a sweeping deal that included the liberation of American contractor Alan Gross and a Cuban spy for the US from their jail cells in Cuba, and pledges to restore full diplomatic relations between the two nations. President Obama says the changes are designed to encourage reform in Cuba's one-party system and centrally planned economy. Castro rejected that idea in his address to the twice-annual meeting of the National Assembly,  We must not expect that in order for relations with the United States to improve, Cuba will abandon the ideas that it has struggled for,  he said. Castro expressed gratitude to Obama for the  just decision  to release the men who spied on anti-Castro exile groups in South Florida in the 1990s and have long been regarded as heroes in Cuba.

The NYPD reports that by the time Monday rolled around, the last time someone in New York City limits had been shot was in Brooklyn on Thursday, meaning that the city went an entire weekend without anyone being shot for the first time in a quarter-century, New York Daily News reports. Reliable records on the stat go back to 1993. A man shot in the ankle in Brooklyn around lunchtime on Monday broke the three-day streak, but the Friday-through-Sunday record stands.  I can't remember the last time we had a weekend where we didn't have at least one shooting in the city,  says NYPD Chief Terence Monahan, who the New York Post notes has been with the department since the early '80s. What Monahan says often leads to shootings is gang violence, and he says what helps prevent them is his department concentrating on keeping retaliation at bay.  One (shooting) can turn into five if we're not on top of it,  Monahan says, explaining that departmental planners meet each Friday to come up with a game plan on how to keep the Big Apple safe. Although the murder rate in the city of 8.6 million people has gone up about 8% from last year, 734 people had been shot in 2018 as of Sunday, compared with 753 in 2017 during the same period.

In a stunning exposé, the newspaper has uncovered that some Subway outlets in New York are serving up  footlongs  that are only 11 to 11.5 inches. The Post was first alerted to the problem by an observant eater whose picture of a sandwich next to a tape measure went viral earlier this week, and the newspaper carried out its own investigation into the matter. Four out of seven so-called  footlongs  purchased in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens came up short. Some have speculated that subs end up shorter when they're toasted, but the Post found no evidence of that. The newspaper also learned that cold-cut portion sizes have been cut by 25% recently, thanks to increased food costs, according to a franchise owner. Needless to say, some customers the Post spoke to were none too pleased:  They're cheating us!  says a guy who eats at Subway every other day. (The newspaper points out that, after a year of his eating habits, the lost inch per sandwich will end up  costing  him $100.)

The racket that Serena Williams threw down onto the court in September 2018 during a US Open final match against Naomi Osaka is up for sale via Goldin Auctions, and while the opening bid is set at just $2,000, founder Ken Goldin thinks it'll bring in at least $10,000, and perhaps as much as $50,000, he tells the New York Times. The incident that led to the racket's untimely demise was Williams' clash with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, which, combined with a playing violation, brought her a $17,000 fine and jump-started a debate over sexism and racism in the tennis industry. The racket took a nonlinear path to Goldin. Ball boy Justin Arrington-Holmes says he got permission from Williams to keep the racket, though after a home cleaning spree, he sold it over the summer to a New York City collectibles shop for $500; a worker from that store said they subsequently sold it.  I wish I'd had someone help me with the process,  Holmes says after finding out how much the racket might go for now. This isn't the only Williams' racket that's seen auction action: Forbes notes one she smashed in 2005's Wimbledon was put up for sale last month by Nate D.

The BBC reports on the allegations, which date back 15 years to when the then-teen's family took her to a man named Jago for an unspecified treatment and left her in his care. Jago allegedly told the family the girl, identified by the Jakarta Post as HS, left for Jakarta to find work later that year; they searched for her fruitlessly. But a tip led police to Galumpang in central Sulawesi, where they say they found the now-28-year-old living in what the BBC describes as a cave near Jago's home that was outfitted with a few items of furniture. The Post paints a cruder picture, framing it as a  hole  and a  crevice between several very large rocks.   We found the victim in a gap between rocks,  says a local police rep. Officials say she was too fearful to flee because of a spirit, or  jin.  The BBC reports Jago allegedly convinced her she was possessed by one; the Post describes him as telling her the hole was being guarded by one. Either way, both reports describe her as  brainwashed.  Jago is accused of raping her throughout her captivity and faces as many as 15 years in prison if convicted; further charges may be filed. In a truly bizarre twist, the Post reports police learned of HS' whereabouts from a neighbor of Jago's son—who is married to the sister of HS, who allegedly knew where her sister was and argued with her husband about it; the neighbor allegedly heard their argument and informed police.",Teen Missing Since 2003 Found in 'Gap Between Rocks'

The tech giant found that out Tuesday when, in what Bloomberg calls  the worst-kept secret in Brussels,  Europe's competition chief hit it with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine—the largest ever in this kind of case, per the New York Times. Google was fined for giving its own comparison shopping service preference over its competitors in its search results, with Vestager noting in a European Commission statement that Google  abused its market dominance as a search engine,  keeping other firms from competing and consumers overseas from benefiting from that competition. The ruling notes if the company doesn't make changes within 90 days, it risks more penalties  of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company,  which the BBC estimates could amount to $14 million a day. The Google comparison shopping product, now called  Google Shopping,  hit the EU in 2004, but even though its performance lagged, it still always fell at or near the top in Google search results, while rival services were  demoted.  Google isn't the first Silicon Valley notable to fall onto Vestager's radar: She's also gone after Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, with critics saying her efforts have been overzealous when it comes to American companies. Google, which is expected to appeal the ruling, denies it's done anything untoward, saying competition is booming (it cites Amazon and eBay as examples) and asserting it has helped boost Europe's digital economy.

Pilot Bertrand Piccard was at the controls of the single-seater Solar Impulse 2, which is making the 910-mile journey from Muscat to Ahmedabad without a drop of fuel. It will take an estimated 16 hours of flying as it crosses over the Arabian Sea to India. The aircraft's wings are covered by more than 17,000 solar cells that recharge the plane's batteries; its wingspan is 236 feet, spanning larger than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, but it weighs just 5,070 pounds, or about as much as a minivan.

The apparent defect—being dubbed  yellowgate —is showing up mostly on the black iPhone 4S. Apple has not yet commented. Yellow screens were also a problem reported with the iPhone 4 and iPad 2, but the flaws disappeared after a glue used to manufacture the products dried.

In their lawsuit, the three 2013 graduates said the article  created a simple and direct way to match the alleged attackers  from the alleged gang rape to them based on details provided in the story.  Upon release of the article, family friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and reporters easily matched (Elias) as one of the alleged attackers and, among other things, interrogated him, humiliated him, and scolded him,  the lawsuit said, adding that Hadford and Fowler  suffered similar attacks.

According to a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling last week, Pellow's boyfriend, Khek Chanthalavong, was using a blowtorch to burn fur off a squirrel he planned to eat when he left the blowtorch unattended on Pellow's wooden deck for 15 minutes in October 2012, reports WZZM.

Peter DeFazio (a Democrat) and Mike Coffman (a Republican) say the success of the all-volunteer force has rendered the agency moot, and that the $24 million spent annually to maintain the draft is a waste. And DeFazio argues it's only persisted this long because politicians fear they'll look weak on national security if they push for its demise. But the AP calls the men's campaign  little noticed.  With its eye on the draft, the AP today circles back to the question of whether women should now be required to sign up. Though the Selective Service System itself issued a statement saying  the law has not been changed to include this,  legal experts say the law won't be on women's side for long. In a 1981 Supreme Court ruling, justices said it was constitutional to exclude women because they weren't allowed to serve in combat roles.

In a speech in Houston yesterday, she called for sweeping moves to expand voting access, including 20 days of early voting and automatic registration when eligible voters turn 18, the Hill reports.

After grueling training regimens, they set off on Nov. 3 from the Ronne Ice Shelf, and both hope to make it to the finish line (the Ross Ice Shelf) in about two months' time, through some of the most extreme conditions and while dragging sleds that initially weighed 375 pounds each.

She also addressed her own mental health issues and apparent recovery:  One of the positive outcomes of her breakdown  was how it inspired her  mission to remove the stigma surrounding anxiety and depression,  said her management agency, called Insanity Group, per the BBC. Her final Instagram post addressed a troll who questioned whether she was male because of her muscular body:  I have never adhered to societal norms and I am certainly not going to start now,  she wrote.

"(Mar 11, 2008  12:55 PM CDT) Sixty-six years after his disappearance, a full military funeral is planned for a cadet lost in a flight accident during World War II, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The Army has identified a recently discovered body as Aviation Cadet Ernest Munn of Ohio, who crashed with three other crewmen in an AT-7 Navigator flying over Kings Canyon National Park in 1942. The crash site was discovered in 1947, but the army couldn't identify individual remains, so all four received a group burial. In 2005, hikers discovered the frozen body of another cadet who had been a passenger, and last August Munn’s body was found nearby.

"(Jul 15, 2014  3:19 PM CDT) The F-35 fighter jet is back in the air, with limitations. The military's entire 97-plane fleet was grounded earlier this month following a June 23 engine fire. As the New York Times reports, the investigation thus far hasn't uncovered a design flaw. The apparent problem was a turbine blade in the engine whose  excessive rubbing  led to friction that broke a fan blade and started the fire; no other plane's turbine blades were found to have a similar issue. The jet has now been given a limited flight clearance with an engine inspection regimen and restrictions on its flights, but that clearance won't allow it to make its international debut before would-be buyers at the Farnborough International Airshow this week. The Times says the potential no-show has been  the talk  of the airshow, which started yesterday in Southern England, with a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London calling it  a huge embarrassment.  The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, today said it was a  difficult decision  to cancel the appearance, but explained that a number of restrictions essentially prohibit the F-35 from crossing the Atlantic.

Their parents say police haven't done enough since their children—the youngest of whom is 16—went missing early May 26, because they come from a poor neighborhood. Since then, the story has made headlines around the world, and police today arrested two waiters from the bar and another woman; they're still looking for the bar's owner, who is now considered a fugitive, reports the BBC. The parents insist the disappearance was a kidnapping. But investigators say there is no evidence of an abduction, and only one person on the scene claims to have seen anything—in his telling, masked gunmen stormed the bar and seized the group, but he has since disappeared, leaving behind a false name and contact info. To make things twistier, three of the missing young people are related to crime bosses currently in prison, fueling theories that a rival gang may be involved.

The CEO plans to sell off 30,200,000 of his own shares, grabbing somewhere between $845 million and $1.2 billion, according to a segment Reuters found buried in the company's S-1. That may sound like an ungodly amount of money, but a  substantial majority  of it will go straight to Uncle Sam, to pay taxes  he will incur in connection with the option exercise,  says Facebook in the S-1 amendment. Zuckerberg is selling the second-most stock of any current Facebook shareholder, topped only by Accel Partners, which hopes to make $1.2 billion. But never fear, Zuckerberg fans: He's not selling nearly enough to jeopardize his control of the company; he'll still hold a 57.3% voting majority.

This week, San Francisco-based Elysium Space announced it will launch  symbolic portions  of ashes to the moon for $11,950. (Although the first 50 takers get a $2,000 discount.)  Families now have the historic opportunity to commemorate their departed love ones every night through the everlasting splendor and soft illumination of the Earth's closest companion: the Moon,  says the company. Elysium doesn't have its own rockets, notes Space.com. Instead, it's teamed up with robotics company Astrobotic Technology to hitch a ride, and plans its first lunar memorial launch later this year. As Popular Science explains, the ashes won't be buried; instead the capsules will sit on the moon's surface,  like space litter.  With its announcement, Elysium will be competing against a company out of Houston called Celestis, which plans to start launching ashes to the moon in the next few years for the slightly higher price of $12,500. Both companies currently offer the lesser option of shooting ashes into orbit. Elysium says one of its first customers will be Tennessee's Steven Jenks, who approached Astrobotic with a request to send up his mother's ashes. Reason?

The last boat still looking for the plane left the Australian port of Fremantle on Tuesday to scan areas that might have been missed during the initial search because of sonar issues or too-deep water, reports Perth Now.

According to the Moscow Times, a construction worker in the city of Krasnodar found a cellphone Sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's SIM card to 35-year-old Dmitry Baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among Russia's worst serial killers.

That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the BBC,  food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin  found in the apartment are being tested for human DNA.

On Sept. 8, a trojan horse attack—in which a hacker gains control over a system via software installed by unwitting users—hit security cameras in Israel's Carmel Tunnels toll road, an expert tells the AP. Right away, the major thoroughfare went on lockdown for 20 minutes; the next day it was closed for eight hours. And that led to more than headaches: It caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. The hack didn't appear to boast the sophistication of an enemy government attack; instead, it was likely the work of a group along the lines of Anonymous, the expert notes. The firm in charge of the toll road, on the other hand, says the problem was prompted by a  communication glitch,  not a cyberattack.

It started when 18-year-old Jackie Rosas from Cathedral City, California, saw the troubling post by the 16-year-old, whose blog she had read for a year. Armed with only the blog URL, the girl's first name, and the fact that she was in her school's color guard, Rosas called a suicide hotline and then local police. An officer took over the case around 5pm and set about tracking her down. The officer sought help from a local high school; administrators didn't recognize the girl from her blog photo, but they joined the hunt, locating her Twitter feed. In it, they spotted a November tweet referencing the  UHS marching band.  Their web sleuthing finally surfaced a newspaper article on a marching band that provided the key piece of evidence: Union Township, New Jersey. They contacted police in the area around 1:30am; they were dispatched to a local address where they found the girl, who had taken some pills, and got her medical attention.  I was happy to know that I saved someone's life,  said Rosas.  It happened at random and it's an amazing feeling knowing you are able to help someone from thousands of miles away.",Tumblr Post Spurs 8-Hour Race to Stop Teen's Suicide
"(Jul 1, 2013  7:02 AM CDT) Less than a week after Wendy Davis filibustered the Texas bill that would shutter most of the state's abortion clinics, state lawmakers have returned to the Capitol to take up the bill again. The first time around, the bill failed on the last day of a special legislative session; Gov. Rick Perry called for a second special session to start today, and Republicans are vowing to get the job done faster this time. The process must start over entirely, the AP reports, but as long as supporters of the bill can hustle a bit, there likely won't be a repeat of Davis' feat because it will come to a final vote while there's still too much time left in the session for a filibuster. ( No human being can talk for two weeks,  Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Saturday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Davis was also helped along by hundreds of protesters who cheered until the clock ran out, and opponents of the bill are planning to mobilize again. But this time around, there may be  more presence by law enforcement  to ensure that doesn't happen again, says one Republican state senator. The state troopers wouldn't comment on specific plans, but a spokesperson acknowledged that  when necessary, we will adjust our security measures as a situation merits.  The legislation has already been resubmitted, the Los Angeles Times reports. The session begins at 2pm, and the bill could come up in committee as soon as tomorrow. But it may not come up for a vote this week, if lawmakers break for the holiday. The session can last up to 30 days, but  we should be out of here in 10 days to two weeks,  predicted one Republican state senator. Meanwhile, Davis appeared on three talk shows yesterday, blasting Republicans and warning them that  the eyes of the country are watching.","Texas Lawmakers Return for Abortion Battle, Take 2"
"(Apr 1, 2016  8:13 AM CDT) US employers notched another solid month of hiring in March by adding a higher-than-expected 215,000 jobs, driven by large gains in the construction, retail, and health care industries, the AP reports. Despite the jump, the Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 5% from 4.9%. But that increase includes some good news: More Americans came off the sidelines to look for work, though not all found jobs. The figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff, even as overall growth has slowed since last winter. Steady hiring is also contributing to higher pay, which rose a modest 2.3% from a year earlier to $25.43. That figure has increased since the early years of the recovery but is below a peak of 2.6% reached in December. Sluggish wage growth has been a weak spot in the economy and a source of frustration for many workers since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Paychecks typically grow at a 3.5% pace in a strong economy. Construction firms added 37,000 jobs, likely aided by warmer weather. That helped offset another month of job losses in manufacturing, which has been hit by slower growth overseas, and mining, which includes the oil and gas drilling sector. Low oil prices have cost that industry 185,000 jobs since September 2014. Meanwhile, the MoneyBeat team at the Wall Street Journal has deemed Friday  datageddon  for all of the additional info scheduled to be released, including manufacturing data from the US, China, and Europe and an update from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index.","'Datageddon' Day: 215K More Jobs, but Unemployment Ticks Up"

Investigators believe the highway battle between members of the Zetas and Sinaloa cartels began when gunmen ambushed a convoy of gang vehicles, AP reports. In the nearby state of Michoacan, up to 2,000 people were forced to flee their homes this week by days of fierce fighting between cartel factions, the BBC reports. Officials say the refugees have begun to return their homes after spending several nights in shelters. The conflict between rival factions of the La Familia cartel began Monday but news of the fighting was slow to leak out because local media, on the orders of drug cartels, have largely ceased to cover drug violence, the Wall Street Journal notes.",Mexico Cartel Battle Kills 29
"(Apr 20, 2016  1:54 PM CDT) Up to 500 people are feared dead after a shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea last week, UN refugee agency UNHCR said Wednesday. The AP reports the disaster happened in waters between Italy and Libya, based on accounts from 41 survivors who were rescued on April 16 by a merchant ship. If confirmed, it would be one of the deadliest tragedies on the Mediterranean in the last year. The survivors said they had been among 100 to 200 people who left a town near Tobruk, Libya, on a smugglers' boat last week. The agency said Wednesday that  after sailing for several hours, the smugglers in charge of the boat attempted to transfer the passengers to a larger ship carrying hundreds of people in terribly overcrowded conditions.   At one point during the transfer, the larger boat capsized and sank,  UNHCR said in a statement. Barbara Molinario, a Rome-based spokeswoman for UNHCR, said details remained unclear and its staffers didn't want to press the survivors too hard  as they are still very tried by their experience.  The statements offered the most official comment yet following repeated news reports about the incident in recent days. More than 1 million migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean last year—mostly refugees from war in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria fleeing to Greece, and the European Union, via Turkey. However, the longer Libya-Italy route has traditionally seen more deaths.",Up to 500 Feared Dead in Mediterranean Shipwreck

"(Mar 5, 2012  7:49 AM) Talk of fraud has already tarnished Vladimir Putin's victory in the Russian presidential election; now an international watchdog group says his win, with 63% of the vote, was  clearly skewed,  the BBC reports.  The point of elections is that the outcome should be uncertain,  says a rep for the Organization for Security and Co-operation. But in Russia,  there was no real competition and abuse of government resources ensured that the ultimate winner of the election was never in doubt.  Despite efforts to monitor voting, there were  procedural irregularities  in  almost one-third of polling stations observed,  the watchdog says, calling on Russia to investigate. Moscow may have a more immediate concern, however: The city is getting ready for giant protests over the election this evening, with 12,000 police and troops set to form a  ring of steel  against what could be tens of thousands of demonstrators planning to descend on Pushkin Square, the Telegraph notes.

"(Oct 18, 2015  7:38 AM CDT) Police arrested two teenagers Sunday for allegedly raping a toddler in New Delhi, the latest incident of sexual violence against a young child in the Indian capital. Police said they questioned more than 250 residents of the western Delhi neighborhood where the 2 1/2-year-old girl was raped and left bleeding in a park Friday evening. The two 17-year-old boys were arrested late Saturday, per a top police officer; the deputy commissioner of police said after they were interrogated, the teens admitted their guilt. The toddler was playing outside her home when she went missing during a 10-minute power outage in the neighborhood. Family members found her lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours later. In a separate incident, police on Saturday arrested three men for raping a 5-year-old in an east Delhi suburb. The rape of the two girls came a week after a 4-year-old girl was found dumped near a railway track after being raped and slashed with a blade in the capital. These assaults and others have caused horror and uproar, with Delhi residents accusing the city's government of failure to protect women and girls. India's National Crime Records Bureau says more than 2,000 girls and women were raped in New Delhi in 2014. Delhi's top elected official, Arvind Kejriwal, hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying police were failing at their job and that control over police should be handed over to the state government.

The accelerated repayment plan is a strong indication that finances are looking up for the troubled automaker, which today posted a $1.2 billion loss in its first quarterly report since leaving bankruptcy in July—far better than anticipated in what the AP notes is a sign the automaker's turning around. CEO Fritz Henderson said GM feels a  sense of urgency  about repaying taxpayers. GM is ahead of its financial turnaround plan, thanks to early emergence from bankruptcy, strong sales in China, and a boost from the  cash for clunkers  program. Still, taxpayers will lose a projected $25 billion on the GM bailout, as the government is being repaid partially in GM stock not worth enough to cover the investment.","GM to Repay Bailout Early, Posts (Smaller) $1.2B Loss"

We're all shaking in our boots now,  says Hamburg Airport's vice president, Larry Walsh. Both pilots, one a 60-year-old and the other a 69-year-old accompanied by his 69-year-old wife, had at least 15 years' experience flying.

Christopher Plaskon, 18, accepted a plea bargain during a brief appearance in Milford Superior Court, the AP reports. Sentencing is set for June 6. Plaskon was charged with killing 16-year-old Maren Sanchez at Jonathan Law High School in Milford on April 25, 2014. His family and friends said he became upset that Sanchez turned down his prom invitation. Plaskon was held at a psychiatric hospital after the stabbing. His attorneys were considering an insanity defense. Plaskon lawyer Edward Garvin said his client suffered from psychosis and called the claim that the stabbing was over a prom rejection  inaccurate.  State's Attorney Kevin Lawlor, however, said evidence from several sources pointed to the rejection as the reason for the attack. Garvin said state law would allow Plaskon to apply for parole in 13 years, based on the fact that he was 16 at the time of the killing. Lawlor said the plea bargain was the best result possible in the case. Sanchez was posthumously voted prom queen by her devastated friends.",'Prom Killer' Could Be Out in Just 13 Years

An indictment issued last month said seven Vineland Developmental Center nurses failed to aid the  physical or mental health  of resident Wendy Hart, whom officials described as physically and mentally disabled. Prosecutors alleged the nurses wrapped a bandage around Hart's hand so tightly that it developed gangrene and had to be amputated in April 2012, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services report.

Officials said two of the defendants were registered nurses and the others are licensed practical nurses. They are charged with endangering the welfare of a disabled person. Four of the nurses are also charged with official misconduct and falsifying or tampering with records. All seven were fired from the center; an additional practical nurse who wasn't criminally charged also was fired. A nurses' union rep said the length of time between the amputation and indictments reflects a broken system.  It's terrible, I understand, and am very sympathetic to the patients,  he said.

"(Dec 24, 2015  9:07 AM) In the 1950s, when abortions were rarely sanctioned and only when a committee of doctors approved them, somewhere between 200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed every year. One such case in particular grabbed grim headlines across the country: A young woman by the name of Jacqueline Smith—who wanted to keep her baby—was given a messy illegal abortion in her boyfriend's apartment on Dec. 24, 1955. Sixty years later, there are still lessons to learn from her gruesome death, writes Gillian Frank on Slate. The details captured the attention of many: A hospital attendant gave Smith, who was positioned on a couch covered in blankets and newspaper, 50 times too much anesthesia via an IV drip made from a broomstick and a bottle. When she died, he and Smith's boyfriend cut her body up into small pieces, covered them in Christmas wrapping paper, and placed the packets in Upper West Side trash bins. In her death, the Lebanon, Pennsylvania-born Smith was vilified as an easy woman by some and painted as a lamb in a rough town by others. Lost in the headlines was the larger plight of unwed mothers, the laws impeding access to contraception for both sexes, and the dearth of good sex education, notes Frank:  On Christmas Eve 1955, Jacqueline Smith was 20 years old and had her whole life ahead of her. The men who killed her went to jail, but there was no indictment of a society and policies that were also culpable. For too many Americans, Jacqueline Smith’s past is still all too present.

"(Apr 1, 2016  4:21 PM CDT) A woman befriended a mom and kids at Pennsylvania's King of Prussia Mall on Thursday night and then, when the mom was briefly distracted by her older children, grabbed the baby out of his stroller and ran off. Malika Hunter, the mother of 7-week-old Ahsir Simmons, ran after her, but turned back to check on a child still sitting at their food court table and lost track of her. A search was launched and surveillance video was released showing 32-year-old Cherie Amoore allegedly leaving the mall with Ahsir in her arms, and within hours, both had been found, 6ABC reports. Amoore, who was arraigned Friday on charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment, and more, claims that she gave birth to a baby boy on Feb. 11, but he died shortly after birth and she never told anyone.  I just wanted my baby. I felt like I was holding my son again,  she reportedly told police. But police haven't been able to confirm her story, and friends tell 6ABC they're not sure Amoore was ever really pregnant. While talking to the baby's family at the mall, Amoore told his mother she had a baby around the same age; Hunter says Amoore seemed  nice  and like a  normal, average  person, NBC Philadelphia reports. Shortly before Amoore allegedly took Ahsir, she asked if she could hold him, but his mother refused. Then, when Hunter was distracted and Ahsir started to cry in his stroller, Amoore allegedly picked him up and left. Police say she took him to show her relatives and friends at a few different locations, and it was her family members who recognized her on the surveillance video that was released and called the cops. Ahsir was asleep in a carseat owned by Amoore when police found him; police say Amoore had also given him a bath and new pajamas.",Cops: Woman Snatches 7-Week-Old Baby From Stroller at Mall

They were checking out the home via webcam Saturday night and saw a strange man inside on the surveillance video, the News-Press reports. They contacted Florida authorities, describing the guy and reporting that they watched him enter the home twice—once to take some personal items including their daughter's purse, and again an hour or so later to remove the TV, NBC 2 reports.

The man was gone by the time deputies arrived, but they found pry marks on two doors. The following day, a deputy pulled over a man who failed to stop at an intersection and recognized him from the copy of the surveillance video the couple provided to authorities.

All television stations carried the event live, as the 87-year-old monarch emerged in a wheelchair from a Bangkok hospital where he has taken up residence and was driven through the capital's historic district to the Grand Palace. Buddhist monks led prayers as the king watched, before an audience of government and royal officials. Thais lined the roads along the route, chanting  Long live the king!  The palace had not announced if Bhumibol would appear for the ceremony, but crowds had gathered in anticipation of seeing the monarch. Bhumibol has been hospitalized since October, when he had his gallbladder removed. It was the latest ailment and hospitalization for the king, who has faded from public life over the past several years and on rare outings looks visibly frail and doesn't speak. Thais hold great affection for Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch. He was crowned on May 5, 1950, after coming to the throne in 1946 following the death of his elder brother. Although he is a constitutional monarch with no formal political role, Bhumibol is widely revered and regarded as the country's sole unifying figure. His near-disappearance from public life has coincided with a decade of political instability in Thailand. Worries about his health and succession have contributed to the instability.","Thai King, 87, Leaves Hospital in Rare Outing"

"(Sep 4, 2019  7:27 AM CDT) For nearly four months, Czech medical staff kept a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support, touching her stomach, moving her legs to simulate walking, and talking to her unborn child. On Aug. 15, the fruit of their efforts was born: a healthy baby girl, weighing 4 pounds, 11 ounces and measuring 16.5 inches in length, per Reuters. The 27-year-old mother had been brought unconscious to the hospital in April after suffering a severe stroke, but because the woman had been in otherwise good health, doctors determined the fetus could keep developing inside her, Inside Edition reports. That's when they set to work to keep the fetus alive, and the 117 days they tended to the pregnant woman and her unborn child is believed to be a record for the longest artificially sustained pregnancy in a brain-dead mother. The baby was delivered via C-section in her 34th week of gestation. After the birth, the mother, with her husband and other family around her, was taken off life support and died.

"(Dec 6, 2016  11:33 AM) Australian police are chasing a mysterious suspect almost 47 years after a British girl disappeared from a beach during a family trip. Cheryl Grimmer's family had recently moved to Australia when police believe the 3-year-old was abducted from changing rooms at Fairy Meadow Beach in Wollongong on Jan. 12, 1970. Investigators had little to go on apart from a ransom note that led nowhere and witness reports that a man was seen running toward a parking lot with a blonde girl in a towel. But when witnesses—aged 9 to 12 at the time of the crime—gathered for a re-enactment of the abduction two weeks ago, they described something investigators had apparently missed: a male, possibly 17 or 18, lurking near the changing rooms prior to Cheryl's disappearance, reports the Times.  He was just seen loitering … in the morning and the afternoon,  a detective says. Authorities believe the male—white with brown hair and blue eyes—may have snatched Cheryl after her brother, Ricky, took her to the ladies' changing room and then left to go get his mother, per News.com.au. Ricky Grimmer and his two brothers are now asking the suspect to come forward so they can fulfill a promise to their mother, who died three years ago, to find out what happened to Cheryl.

But there was never enough evidence to charge her until DNA evidence could be retested recently with new technology. Michael Warren was also a suspect, especially since friends and family said his marriage to Marlene was struggling, but he ended up in prison on unrelated charges connected to his car rental agency for three years and then went off the radar.

But for Henry Rayhons, a former Republican legislator in Iowa, it's a trickier case. The 78-year-old is currently on trial, charged with felony sex abuse for allegedly having sex last May with his wife, Donna, in a nursing home a few days after he was told she wasn't able to consent to intimate relations, the New York Times reports. Donna, who died in August, suffered from dementia, with nursing home staff noting she no longer remembered her daughters' names, how to recall everyday words, or how to eat certain foods.  You could see that Donna had Alzheimer's. ... She was just in her pleasant little world,  a nurse from Concord Care Center testified yesterday in Garner, per the Quad-City Times.

In what the AP says was a  largely expected  move, Toshiba noted in a statement Wednesday that its Westinghouse nuclear unit has submitted a Chapter 11 petition to the US Bankruptcy Court of New York. This announcement leaves up in the air what's going to happen to four still-to-be-finished nuclear reactors in South Carolina and Georgia, which were plagued with surpassed budgets and missed deadlines, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters reports that Toshiba—which ventured into nuclear waters when it purchased Westinghouse for $5.4 billion in 2006—is expecting to take a $9 billion loss for the year ending March 31. The New York Times details some of the company's challenges in the nuclear industry, including more affordable forms of other alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, as well as safety fears spurred by the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A Westinghouse statement says that while the firm attempts to reorganize under Chapter 11 parameters, it will be kept afloat by special $800 million financing. Reuters notes the bankruptcy will allow Westinghouse to figure out whether it's worth it to keep plugging ahead on the nuclear reactor projects, some of which are only about a third completed. Some say Toshiba's unique situation can be applied more broadly to the nuclear industry in general.

The storied career of  JoePa  included 409 wins in 46 seasons and two national championships. But his reputation for success with honor was shattered when a former assistant was charged with molesting 10 boys during a 15-year span, including some in the Penn State athletic complex.

Though the View host clearly wasn't championing Angle when she called her a bitch two shows in a row, she seems to be doing wonders for Angle's coffers: Angle raked in $150,000 following Tuesday's show, sent flowers, got skewered again ... and raised more money, to the tune of $136,000 yesterday, reports the Washington Examiner. Should that cash help propel Angle into office, she says she'll finally start chatting with the press. During an appearance on yesterday's Heidi Harris Show, Angle explained that she's been dodging the press because  the lamestream media or the left-leaning progressive press are really very much in Harry Reid's camp. They promote him as much as they can, and certainly that's not their intent when they come to interview me.  When the radio host asked it it would be different after she got elected, Angle replied,  Well certainly. I'm hoping that as we get into this once I get elected senator that they will be much more civil and we will have a very civil discourse.

"(Aug 14, 2012  2:15 PM CDT) New York's financial regulator said his agency has reached a $340 million settlement with Standard Chartered Bank to resolve an investigation into whether the British bank schemed with the Iranian government to launder $250 billion from 2001 to 2007. The bank will pay the civil penalty to the state and strengthen oversight of overseas transactions. Standard Charter will install a monitor for at least two years who will evaluate the money-laundering risk controls of its New York branch and take corrective measures, the department said. The bank conspired with its Iranian clients to route nearly 60,000 different US dollar payments through Standard Chartered's New York branch  after first stripping information from wire transfer messages used to identify sanctioned countries, individuals and entities,  according to agency's order. In a statement released last night, Standard Chartered Bank said it  strongly rejects  and  contests  the New York regulators' portrayal of its transactions with Iranian banks.

Now the little girl has died; her brother remains in critical condition, the Sun Sentinel reports. They unlocked the door and escaped from their caretaker's apartment when the woman went to the bathroom, then walked to the pool area 150 yards away, police say. The gate to the pool was open, CBS Miami reports. Their mom, Althea Bradford, works in the leasing office on the property, which is next to the pool. It's not clear how much time passed before the caretaker realized the children had escaped from her apartment, but officials estimate the twins were underwater for at least four minutes, a full minute longer than the point at which irreparable damage is said to set in.

McCain met with Gadhafi along with such Senate notables as Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Joe Lieberman, but the cable indicates that McCain did most of the talking, Politico reports. McCain stressed that Libya needed to fulfill its promise to give up its weapons of mass destruction, but he also described US-Libyan relations as strong, and thanked Libya for its counterterrorism cooperation. But in a May interview, Lindsey Graham said the meeting led nowhere.  We never did anything,  he said.  I didn’t feel comfortable pushing the Pentagon to provide military aircraft to Libya.

"(Mar 27, 2016  12:33 PM CDT) Jim Harrison, the fiction writer, poet, outdoorsman, and reveler who wrote with gruff affection for the country's landscape and rural life and enjoyed mainstream success with his historical saga Legends of the Fall, has died at 78. A rep for Harrison's publisher told the AP that Harrison died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Ariz. The cause of death was unknown. Harrison's wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last fall. The versatile author completed more than 30 books, most recently the novella collection The Ancient Minstrel, and was admired worldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of his interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin near his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood script writer who was close with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles, and Warren Beatty. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary appetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of tales. Published in 1979, Legends of the Fall was a collection of three novellas that featured the title story about Montana rancher Col. William Ludlow and his three sons, the narrative extending from before World War I to the mid-20th century, from San Francisco to Singapore.  Late in October 1914 three brothers rode from Choteau, Montana to Calgary, Alberta to enlist in the Great War,  reads Harrison's celebrated opening sentence. The book was a best-seller, and Harrison worked on the script for an Oscar-nominated 1994 film.

"(Nov 5, 2016  2:32 PM CDT) Portraying all the contents of a spherical Earth on a flat, two-dimensional piece of paper is notoriously difficult, which is why we've relied on, for more than four centuries, a map that inaccurately shows Greenland, Alaska, and Antarctica as imposingly huge. But now a new map by Japanese artist and architect Hajime Narukawa is so proportionally accurate that it may simply have no match, reports Gizmodo. You can print the AuthaGraph World Map and fold it up into a globe—taking it from 2D to 3D—and still maintain proper land and water proportions, a feat so impressive that it has just won the esteemed Japanese Good Design Award. (If you think it sounds easy, try folding the Mercator projection, created in 1569, into a globe and see what you get. So how did Narukawa do it? The key, as Popular Mechanics explains, was to divvy up the planet  into 96 equal regions and then [transfer] the dimensions from a sphere to a tetrahedron  (four equilateral triangles laid into the shape of one larger one) and then transfer them again to a rectangular map. The map's accuracy could improve further if the number of subdivisions increases, the Good Design Award description notes, but as it currently stands the map  faithfully represents all oceans, continents including the neglected Antarctica.  It won't necessarily sound the death knell for the Mercator projection, though; Popular Mechanics points out it  doesn't align according to the cardinal directions.  It's on sale in poster and globe form through its own AuthaGraph site. (The view of planet Earth from space is a particularly cloudy one.)",This New Map Crushes the One We've Relied On Since 1569

I don't think the public realizes how often this happens,  says Evanston's 911 coordinator.  When you consider the number of these types of calls that we receive, it really taxes our resources.  The growing problem likely stems from the fact that many new phones have a 911-specific button.

He'll be sentenced on Feb. 15, and faces up to 11 years in juvenile detention, the Press-Enterprise reports. He was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors argued that the killing was cold and premeditated—the boy's sister testified that he told her he intended to kill Hall days before he did so. The defense initially entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, but later withdrew it, arguing that the boy had been abused, and raised in a violent home where killing was deemed acceptable. Both sides agreed his father's National Socialist Movement ties weren't a motivating factor. Instead, the boy said he was mad at Hall for spanking and kicking him, and worried he'd leave the family for another woman, separating him from his stepmother.",12-Year-Old Convicted for Murder of Neo-Nazi Dad

Burkhalter said her doctor had prescribed the  federally legal CBD oil,  which is derived from the cannabis plant, to soothe her arthritis. But police said the oil contained THC, the psychoactive property in cannabis, and arrested the 69-year-old for possession of hashish; the one-ounce bottle was labeled  zero THC.

"(May 20, 2009  5:09 PM CDT) Sadly, Mickey Mouse will need a new voice. Wayne Allwine, who has voiced the character for the past three decades in movies and at Disney parks, died Monday from diabetes at age 62, the Los Angeles Times reports. Allwine is only the third person to voice Mickey, following Walt Disney himself and Jimmy Macdonald. Allwine's wife, Russi Taylor, is the voice of Minnie Mouse.  Wayne was my hero,  said Taylor, who's had the Minnie role since 1986.  He really loved doing Mickey Mouse and was very proud that he did it 32 years.  Allwine always thought of his job as a great honor.  It's really not about me,  he once said.  It's about Mickey, and Mickey is Walt's. So what I do is I get to take this wonderful American icon and keep it alive until the next Mickey comes along.","Wayne Allwine, Voice of Mickey, Dead at 62"
"(Apr 20, 2012  9:59 AM CDT) Last year, 10,000 people showed up for a giant marijuana rally at the University of Colorado-Boulder—and school officials don't want it to happen again. They got a helping hand from a judge yesterday, who supported the university's plan to bar outsiders from its campus today—4/20, a hallowed day for pot smokers. The school has tried—and failed—to stop revelers in the past; previous efforts have included switching on lawn sprinklers and offering cash to any student who would identify people caught smoking in photos. This year, not even students will be allowed to enter Norlin Quadrangle, which has played host to the event in the past. And officials took things a step further, blanketing the quad with a smelly, fish-based fertilizer, reports the AP. They're also offering a free Wyclef Jean concert timed to coincide with the traditional 4:20pm pot gathering. But campus groups are still planning events, Colorado Daily reports. A lawyer for local medical marijuana businesses says the rally offered an  anti-Prohibition message :  If free speech isn't allowed on a college campus, where is it safe?",School Tries to Squash 4/20 Bash With Stinky Fertilizer

"(Jun 28, 2019  2:40 PM CDT) A University of Utah student who had been missing since June 17 is dead, Salt Lake City police said in announcing the arrest of a man they say killed her. Police said Ayoola Ajayi, 31, killed MacKenzie Lueck and burned her body. A SWAT team took Ajayi into custody Friday at an apartment complex on suspicion of aggravated murder, aggravated kidnapping, desecration of a body, and obstruction of justice, the Salt Lake City Tribune reports. Lueck, 23, vanished after returning to Salt Lake City after attending her grandmother's funeral in California. She took a ride-share from the airport to a park about 11 miles away and, police said, got into another car there, per CBS. That was the last time she was seen. Social media and phone records show that Ajayi was the last person Lueck communicated with, police say. Records show that their phones were both in the park within less than a minute of each other, per CNN. Witnesses told police that they saw Ajayi, who has no criminal history in Utah, burning something using gas in his backyard on June 17 and 18. A search found evidence, including human tissue and personal items of Lueck's, the police chief said. A friend and former roommate of Ajayi's was stunned by the allegations, saying the suspect projected an image of an educated, cultured professional. Ajayi’s LinkedIn profile says he worked in information technology for Dell, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Comcast, and the Army. He also modeled for fine art photographs, the profile says.

But as time ticked away to secure a bank loan for a permanent building for GracePoint Church, Lamb began to lose hope. One man donated $150,000, but the church needed twice that to meet the bank's terms, the Chicago Tribune reports. Then a woman offered up a gold $20 Double Eagle coin. The rare piece stamped 1866 was in the first series stamped with  In God We Trust.  The coin, one of 30, was never put in circulation. There are believed to be only 10 left, a rep for Heritage Auctions tells NBC Chicago. She estimates the coin could sell for more than $300,000 at an auction later this month.  Honestly, we were completely stunned by the value of the coin,  Lamb says. The donor, who requested anonymity, tells CBS Chicago she has all she needs.  I can get by just fine. I’m not looking for wealth.  But Lamb tells NBC the coin, which was purchased by her late husband, a collector, has been something of a  thorn in her side  since four assailants broke into her house a few years ago and tried to steal it. A neighbor intervened and they failed. For Lamb, the  incredible gift  that will allow GracePoint to move into a converted furniture store has restored his faith.

"(Feb 21, 2014  8:15 AM) Colorado and Utah are taking a page from Michael Bloomberg's book: Both states have moved to raise the smoking age to 21, following a similar bill passed in New York City last fall. The proposals were given the initial go-ahead yesterday, and though more votes are needed, this is the furthest any state has gone to rein in teen access to cigarettes, the AP notes. Utah—with the nation's lowest smoking rate at 12% as of 2011—is already one of only four states that require tobacco purchasers to be 19. The smoking rate is low in Colorado, too, at about 18%, but health advocates only want to see it fall.  What I'm hoping to do is make it harder for kids to obtain cigarettes,  says Colorado Rep. Cheri Gerou, while a Utah woman adds,  By raising the age limit, it puts them in a situation where they're not going to pick it up until a much later age.  A study last year found 90% of daily smokers have their first cigarette by 18, and 90% of those who buy cigarettes for minors are between 18 and 20. Still, the Salt Lake Tribune notes it was an  emotional debate  in Utah, with opponents arguing adults should be free to make their own choices—even if they're bad ones—and noting a  slippery slope  could lead to bans on high-calorie foods ... or teen motorcycle riding.","Colorado, Utah Propose: Under 21?

"(Mar 10, 2017  5:04 PM) Crocodiles and their ancestors have been roaming the Earth for 200 million years, rubbing shoulders (do crocodiles even have shoulders?) with the dinosaurs, the BBC reports. Now researchers—in a study published this week in PLOS One—say they've discovered the world's oldest known crocodile eggs. The fossilized eggs are 152 million years old and were dug up during a years-long excavation in Portugal—with some of them found in dinosaur nests, strangely enough. Researchers say it's unclear why the crocodile eggs were in dinosaur nests, but it seems  to suggest some form of biological relationship.  The eggs were laid by members of a group of prehistoric crocodiles known as crocodylomorphs. The Telegraph reports they appear to be from two different types of crocodylomorph. The newly discovered eggs are 40 million years older than the previous oldest known crocodile eggs and yet are strikingly similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles. One egg clutch contained 13 intact eggs, making it the most complete clutch of ancient crocodile eggs ever found.

The dog was first spotted at an apartment complex near Houston's Hobby Airport, KTRK reports—sometimes on the steps, sometimes at the complex's front gates, sometimes camped out at one particular apartment's front door.  You could just tell that he was a lost dog,  neighbor Cassandra Eubanks says.  He would follow the cars and when he would realize that it was not his owner's car, he would just stand there and look helpless.  What the poor pup didn't realize: His owner, 54-year-old Hatem Abuharbid, had been killed in a robbery Feb. 7 at the convenience store where he worked, ABC News reports.  Of course he's confused, because he doesn't know what's going on,  Eubanks says. The dog wouldn't approach neighbors who left food and water out for him, but he was eventually rescued by a woman who had heard about his plight on social media.  It just broke my heart to hear that the poor animal lost his owner, his best friend,  Maranda Perez tells KTRK. She brought her own dog along and worked patiently for about an hour to make the now-ownerless dog comfortable around her. After following him up three flights of stairs, Perez was finally able to place a leash around his neck and get him, with some resistance, into her car.  He was still very shaken up whenever I touched him,  she says. Perez says she'll take care of him for the next week or so before Abuharbid's brother takes the dog in.

"(Jun 13, 2018  4:40 PM CDT) Comcast made a $65 billion bid Wednesday for Fox's entertainment businesses, setting up a battle with Disney to become the next mega-media company, the AP reports. The bid comes just a day after a federal judge cleared AT&T's takeover of Time Warner and rejected the government's argument that it would hurt competition in cable and satellite TV and jack up costs to consumers for streaming TV and movies. The ruling signaled that Comcast could win regulatory approval, too; its bid for Fox shares many similarities with the AT&T-Time Warner deal. Comcast says its cash bid is 19% higher than the value of Disney offer as of Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal and others reported earlier that Comcast had lined up $60 billion in cash to challenge Disney for media mogul Rupert Murdoch's company. Disney's offer was for $52.5 billion when it was made in December, though the final value will depend on the stock price at the closing.","Comcast Challenges Disney, Offers $65B for Fox"
"(Aug 3, 2017  3:17 PM CDT) A woman who encouraged her suicidal boyfriend to kill himself in dozens of text messages and told him to  get back in  a truck filled with toxic gas was sentenced Thursday to 15 months in jail for involuntary manslaughter, the AP reports. Michelle Carter was convicted in June by a judge who said her final instruction to Conrad Roy III caused his death. Carter was 17 when the 18-year-old Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in July 2014. Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz gave Carter a 2½-year jail sentence but said she had to serve only 15 months of that. He also sentenced her to five years of probation. He granted a defense motion that would keep Carter out of jail until her appeals in Massachusetts courts are exhausted. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, had asked the judge to spare his client any jail time and instead give her five years of probation and require her to receive mental health counseling. Prosecutor Maryclare Flynn called probation  just not reasonable punishment  for Carter's role in Roy's death. The prosecution sought the maximum sentence of 20 years. Cataldo argued that Roy was determined to kill himself and nothing Carter did could change that. Cataldo also argued that Carter's words amounted to free speech protected by the First Amendment. In convicting Carter, the judge focused his ruling on Carter telling Roy to  get back in  after he climbed out of his truck as it was filling with carbon monoxide and told her he was afraid. The judge said those words constituted  wanton and reckless conduct  under the manslaughter statute.",Woman Who Sent Texts Urging Suicide Gets 15 Months in Jail

(Watch the capsule, attached to four parachutes, touch down in the water here.) The flight from the International Space Station took about six hours, the AP reports.

The Verge reports there was one especially notable achievement for SpaceX during this test flight: The unmanned Crew Dragon managed to dock itself to an exterior ISS port, a move the company had never done before, and one that's needed if SpaceX eventually ferries people to the space station. There was one  witness  on board the capsule: a  smart  test dummy named Ripley, which was built to measure how the human body would be affected.

"(Sep 19, 2011  6:59 PM CDT) A federal appeals court voted 2-1 today to throw out the 17-year sentence handed to alleged  dirty bomber  Jose Padilla, saying that it was too low given his criminal history and the threat he poses.  Padilla’s sentence of 12 years below the low end of the Guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment,  the majority wrote in their ruling, according to ABC News.  Padilla poses a heightened risk of future dangerousness due to his al-Qaeda training.  The dissenting judge said she disagreed, because overturning the sentence  simply substitutes this Court’s sentencing judgment for that of the trial judge, in whom that authority inheres.  When Padilla was arrested in 2002, John Ashcroft accused him of plotting to blow up a dirty bomb, but when he was eventually brought to trial in civilian court, there was no mention of a bomb—he was merely accused of being part of a cell that funneled recruits and cash to al-Qaeda and other terrorists.

In New Zealand, 19-year-old Etienne Naude placed a slice of bread on the ground at a precisely calculated spot. In Spain, 34-year-old Angel Sierra did the same, reports the BBC. The result is an  earth sandwich —two slices of bread placed on opposite sides of the planet with about 7,900 miles of earth between them, per the Guardian. See the resulting images for yourself via Reddit. (Sierra actually placed nine slices on the ground, to make extra-sure he hit his precise coordinate.) The men used longitude and latitude to figure out where to lay their respective slices of bread. Technically speaking, they placed the slices on antipodes—points opposite each other on the Earth's surface.  We made sure to get the exact location with Google Maps, to get us within a few meters range, and then we used the actual image data on Google Maps to pinpoint ourselves even closer than that,  Naude tells RNZ. His spot was relatively close to where he lived, but Sierra had to travel several miles.  It's quite tough to find a spot which isn't water on the New Zealand end—and where public roads or paths intersect in both sides,  he says.

Amber Heard, 29, was charged Tuesday with two counts of illegally importing the Yorkshire terriers, and one count of providing a false document, reports NBC News. Depp and Heard brought their two dogs into the country on a private jet, but didn’t declare them on the passenger manifest, get a permit, or have them quarantined.

The former New York City mayor has now qualified for two states, having filed the paperwork for Alabama last week. Both states have early filing deadlines.

"(Nov 10, 2017  6:37 AM) An Alabama man who said he tripped and broke his hip while buying a watermelon at a Walmart store has won a $7.5 million verdict in his lawsuit against the retailer. Henry Walker on Wednesday was awarded the damages after a jury trial in Phenix City, Alabama, just west of the Georgia state line, court records show. Walker had sued Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., saying his foot became trapped in a pallet beneath the watermelons as he reached for one of the fruits at a Phenix City Walmart on June 25, 2015. Al.com reports that when the then-59-year-old turned back toward his shopping cart, he fell. One of his lawyers says that Walker's days of playing basketball three times a week ended with the injury, which now requires him to use a walker.","Man Sues Walmart Over Watermelon Injury, Wins $7.5M"
"(Aug 11, 2015  10:20 AM CDT) The search for a missing 5-year-old boy in Arizona has come to a tragic end. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office has confirmed on Facebook that the body of Jerold Joseph Williams was found last night in Kaibab National Forest, where he disappeared while camping last Thursday. Police tell NBC News Jerold was at most 200 yards from a campsite the boy and his parents were sharing with a 20-strong group of friends and relatives when he escaped his mother's sight. A previous report from ABC15 suggests his mother was with him at the time, and that he vanished from her view as he started to chase grasshoppers. More than 500 volunteers searched the rugged terrain for the missing boy over a five-day span alongside military helicopters carrying night vision equipment and crews with dogs and ATVs, reports ABC15. The AP describes volunteers trudging shoulder-to-shoulder through thick vegetation in the pouring rain yesterday in search of Jerold, whose body was found by a member of the search team. A sheriff's rep last night said a positive ID would need to be made using dental records and fingerprints. A cause of death has not been released; officials previously said there was no indication of foul play.",5-Year-Old Lost Chasing Grasshoppers Turns Up Dead
"(Dec 23, 2016  9:56 AM) A flier's (or, as some other media put it,  moron's ) decision to name his wifi hotspot  Samsung Galaxy Note7_1097  caused trouble in the skies Tuesday night. In case you've been dozing during recent pre-takeoff announcements, airlines worldwide have banned the Samsung GN7 after reports the phone's lithium-ion battery can catch fire. The BBC reports the mid-air trouble began when a passenger on Virgin America 358 opened up his laptop and spotted the suspiciously named wifi network. In a series of tweets, Lucas Wojciechowski recounted what happened on the late-night flight from San Francisco to Boston after a call went out requesting that the passenger carrying a GN7 press his or her call button. First came a crew announcement:  This isn't a joke. We're going to turn on the lights (it's 11pm) and search everyone's bag until we find it.  Then 15 minutes later:  This is the captain speaking.  Wojceichowski tweets that if no one owns up, the plane will have to land. Then finally, relief:  Ladies and gentlemen, we found the device. Luckily only the name of the device was changed to 'Galaxy Note 7'. It was not a GN7.  In a statement provided to TechnoBuffalo, Virgin America explains that  when our InFlight Teammates see potential evidence of [the GN7] onboard, they take it seriously.  The airline corrects earlier reports that the kerfuffle affected flights, saying  no flights were cancelled or delayed as a result  of the incident.

NBC News reports the first 911 call came at 10:08pm local time, just as a police officer on the scene raised the alarm:  We got shots fired, sounds like an automatic firearm,  the officer said over a police radio channel, per the New York Times. Less than a minute later, an officer described shots as  coming from upstairs in the Mandalay Bay,  per the Times. Within minutes, an officer who'd reached the 31st floor of the 43-story Mandalay Bay commented that he could hear  automatic fire coming from … one floor above us.  Per a Times analysis of video of 15 seconds of the attack, about 90 shots were fired in just 10 seconds. Police communications suggest the shooting had ended by 10:25pm, when officers arrived outside Suite 135 on the 32nd floor, though a hotel security guard was at one point shot through the suite door. It took almost an hour for SWAT teams to secure the floor before Paddock's room was accessed using an explosive device. Paddock, who'd allegedly smashed the floor-to-ceiling windows in the suite in order to take aim at a crowd of 22,000 gathered for the Route 91 Harvest festival 500 yards away, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 11:20pm, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

"(Apr 10, 2019  2:28 AM CDT) The first day of spring was weeks ago—but there's still a serious bout of winter weather on its way for the central US. The Rockies and Plains could be hit by the second  bomb cyclone  in two months Wednesday as an April blizzard causes a drastic drop in pressure in cities like Denver, which experienced temperatures of around 80 degrees Tuesday, NPR reports. The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions are expected in the central and northern plains, in states including Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota. South of the heavy snow, severe thunderstorms and heavy rain are expected from the central plains to the middle Mississippi Valley, exacerbating flooding in some areas. The National Weather Service office in Colorado says precipitation will start as rain Wednesday but snow is expected as the colder air moves in. In Minneapolis, forecasters say the  potentially historic winter storm  could drop up to a foot of snow. The system will be considered a  bomb cyclone  if the air pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours, reports CNN, which notes that it is rare for a single storm this size to develop inland, let alone two in less than 30 days. But even if it doesn't end up fitting the cyclone definition,  we're talking a blockbuster blizzard,  meteorologist Jeff Berardelli tells CBS. He predicts that the storm will move slowly across the region for two days after hitting the central Plains on Wednesday.

In a Thursday presser, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said the DNA of registered sex offender Robert Eugene Koehler has been linked to at least 24 sexual assaults believed to have been carried out by the  Pillowcase Rapist.  Per CNN, when investigators searched the 60-year-old's home, they made a disturbing find underneath: a dug-out area they think Koehler was prepping to be a  dungeon,  according to Miami-Dade County prosecutor Laura Adams.  We feared very much that if we had not gotten him into custody that he may have had other plans even worse than what he executed on all of these women,  Adams said. She added that investigators also found safes at the home, one of which housed jewelry and other items that authorities suspect may have been mementos from his alleged attacks. The Washington Post reports the big break in the case came when Koehler's 29-year-old son was recently arrested for domestic violence; the DNA authorities collected from him closely matched the Pillowcase Rapist's, so investigators started focusing on the elder Koehler. They obtained his DNA by tailing him to a public area then swabbing objects he'd touched.  This familial contact was ... just what we needed to be able to piece this all together,  Rundle said, per the New York Times. Koehler has pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexual battery related to a 1983 attack on a 25-year-old woman.

Back in 2016, Alberts pumped fecal matter into her 15-year-old son's IV at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis, where he was being treated for leukemia. Doctors noticed that the boy developed mysterious and persistent blood infections, which forced them to stop his chemotherapy for nearly two months. Doctors said he might have died from septic shock, per Fox 59. Alberts initially said she used water to  flush it as the medicine that was given to him burned,  but later admitted it was fecal matter she stored in a gift bag in the bathroom sink of her son's room, per WGN.

Police tailed and arrested Theresa Wiltse, 49, after she got the ransom for Sandra Harris, 69, at a gourmet grocery store Friday night, the AP reports.  Theresa confessed to being part of the kidnapping,  along with two men she identified only as  Jose  and  Jesus,  the report said.

Police only have Wiltse in custody but said they were not ruling out the possibility of additional arrests. The kidnapping was not random—Wiltse knew the victim and her husband, Randy Harris, who owns a pawn shop in the city of Kennewick called Ace Jewelry and Loan, authorities said, though exactly how they knew each other is still under investigation. Harris was kidnapped Friday from her Kennewick home, police said. Harris called her husband at work from her cellphone to say the kidnapper was demanding money, they said. The FBI joined local police in contacting the suspect and negotiating for several hours before agreeing to meet up in rural Franklin County that night to pay the ransom.

"(Nov 9, 2009  12:42 PM) As  the exhaustive and perfectly blameless celebrations  of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall unfold, Anne Applebaum has a bone to pick. The festivities are  focusing on what didn’t happen rather than what did,  she writes, treating  the past two decades as a foregone conclusion.  But those 20 years have been perhaps the  best in Central Europe for 300 years,  and no one thought that would happen. In 1989,  no one had the slightest idea  of what was to come, Applebaum writes for Slate.  Angela Merkel has said that she thought it was ridiculous even to speculate on the possibility of a united Germany,  and  those who did make predictions saw a dark future  of hypernationalism, rabid anti-Communism, even a  Fourth Reich.  There have been problems, of course—but the takeaway is  what an extraordinary, almost unbelievable, success it has all been.",Post-1989 Germany an Unexpected Success

"(Jul 29, 2019  6:46 PM CDT) President Trump signed a measure Monday extending the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund indefinitely. The Senate gave it final approval last week after a Congress-shaming campaign by comedian Jon Stewart. Extending the fund is  a sacred duty,  Trump said Monday.  Today we come together as one nation to support our September 11th heroes to care for their families and to renew our eternal vow—never, ever forget,  he said, per CNN. First responders, people affected by the attacks, and lawmakers attended the Rose Garden ceremony. One lawmaker who said she was not invited was the measure's lead co-sponsor, Rep. Carolyn Maloney. The Democrat had worn a New York firefighter jacket since February, per CBS, and pledged she wouldn't take it off until Congress passed the funding. Before the signing ceremony, Trump called first responders to the stage to make sure it wouldn't collapse.  I don't know if this stage will hold it, but if it doesn't, we're not falling very far,  he said, per Newsweek. Speaking of Ground Zero, he told the first responders:  I was down there also—but I’m not considering myself a first responder. But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you.  It's not clear what he could have been referring to: Politico has reported that he spent the day at Trump Tower, four miles from the World Trade Center.

Bangkok's bomb squad chief says construction workers found the bomb buried at a building site and sold it to the scrap shop. Workers at the shop were using a gas-powered thermal cutter to take the bomb apart when it exploded yesterday. The massive blast ripped apart the scrap shop in Bangkok's Lad Plakao neighborhood and damaged nearby houses. Authorities initially reported seven dead, but search crews later found a child's body in the rubble, believed to be a girl about 4 years old.

Exercising 92 minutes per week could substantially extend your life, according to a new study. Researchers in Taiwan studied more than 400,000 subjects between 1996 and 2008, and deduced that those who exercised even a little bit were 14% less likely to die during the next eight years and lived an average three years longer, reports the Washington Post.  If the minimum amount of exercise we suggest is adhered to, mortality from heart disease, diabetes and cancer could be reduced,  wrote the scientists.  This low volume of physical activity could play a central part in the global war against non-communicable diseases, reducing medical costs and health disparities.

"(Jan 20, 2015  11:48 AM) As far as repeat cruisegoers go, you'd be hard-pressed to beat the record of Lee Wachtstetter. The 86-year-old Florida woman logged 89 cruises with her husband of 50 years, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. After he died of cancer in 1997 (making her promise to keep cruising the day before he passed),  Mama Lee  traded her Fort Lauderdale home for one on the open seas. She tells the Asbury Park Press she spent three years aboard a Holland America ship but  the day they announced they were stopping the dance host program was the day I decided to leave.  She has since spent almost seven years living on the Crystal Serenity (which, yes, has dance hosts to take the floor with the partner-less). Her estimated 2015 cost: $164,000. That covers her seventh-deck stateroom, meals, gratuities, and, of course, all that sailing. She says she stopped counting countries after hitting 100 (she said she had completed 200 cruises in her first four years on the Crystal Serenity), but she typically no longer goes ashore when the liner docks—though she can't resist Istanbul and its Grand Bazaar. As she told the News-Herald in 2012,  Now I have arthritis and don't want to deal with cobblestones. I also don't use the stairs.

The South Korean ship carrying automobiles capsized off the coast of Georgia on Sunday, and the Coast Guard previously rescued 19 crew members. The four remaining crew members are believed to be trapped in the engine room of the Golden Ray. The ship flipped shortly after leaving the Port of Brunswick in Georgia, though the reason is unclear.  The most common cause of a ship capsizing is cargo instability,  a naval architect tells the Journal.  If cargo is not properly secured it could move to one side, the vessel loses its balance and lies on its side.

"(Jan 28, 2017  11:25 AM) Invasive grass carp have reached three of the Great Lakes and pose a significant environmental risk there, but time remains to prevent them from getting out of hand, according to a scientific analysis released Friday. The voracious grass carp is among four Asian carp species threatening to reach the world's largest surface freshwater system, the AP reports. Grass carp have been found in Lakes Erie, Michigan, and Ontario, although it's uncertain how many there are or how widely they have spread, US and Canadian researchers said. At least some are reproducing. A spokesperson for the Great Lakes Fisher Commission says the risk to the Great Lakes is  pretty substantial.  Grass carp were introduced to the US in the early 1960s to control weed growth in waterways. Some escaped into the Mississippi River and have migrated northward toward the Great Lakes. They've been turning up more often in recent years, and the threat of a full-fledged invasion appears to be rising. The analysis said it is  very likely  that grass carp will become established in Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Ontario within 10 years unless effective steps are taken to stop them. Researchers are studying how to prevent that. Tougher enforcement of laws against bringing them into the region would help, along with greater care to prevent release of fertile fish from hatcheries.",Study Says Grass Carp Have Invaded 3 of the Great Lakes

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says that given Newman's age and health—he's on heart medication—North Korea should release him so he can be reunited with his family.

Steve Crawford, 72, was a security guard who claimed to have found the body of 19-year-old Arlis Perry inside the Stanford Memorial Church, a chapel on the university campus, in October 1974. Perry had fought with her new husband and had come to the church at night to pray, CBS San Francisco reports. Perry was found with an icepick in the back of her head and was naked below the waist. She had been molested with a 3-foot altar candle and another candle had been placed between her breasts, investigators reported.",Suspect Kills Himself 44 Years After Gruesome Church Murder
"(Dec 28, 2010  7:51 AM) President Obama’s reelection campaign will likely be based in Chicago, not Washington—a rare move for a sitting president, and one that his advisers hope will help him rekindle the energy of 2008, Politico notes. Usually, campaigns are kept close to the president’s DC home, where they’re easily accessible, said a Democratic consultant:  In modern presidential history, this is kind of revolutionary.   For people who have been in the White House the past two years, it's probably a good idea to get outside the presidential bubble,  the consultant added. It could also help prevent leaks, since staffers won’t be mixing with reporters so much. The tough part will be keeping the White House and the campaign staff in sync, said a former Carter administration official:  A campaign is a full-time job and running a White House is a full-time job, and the people have to be compatible with each other because events mainly determine reelection.",2008 All Over Again: Obama to Base Campaign in Chicago

And no one initially disputed the Sudanese immigrant's age of 17—until apparently this week, when the basketball star was found to probably be a 30-year-old man and arrested for allegedly violating the country's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nicola, who had his first detention review Tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in Canada from Sudan in November, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life.  I don't know how many of [my friends] have a clue of how it is in Africa,  he had told the Star back in January. But during his five-month stint on the school's basketball team, his size raised eyebrows.  I did think he looked older than a high-schooler,  another student who played against Nicola in a December tournament tells the New York Daily News.  Basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone.  Nicola's coach, whom he lives with, said in the January Star article that  I think this kid will have a chance at the NBA. I have never said that about any kid from Windsor.  The school is remaining tight-lipped about Nicola specifically, with a spokesman telling the Star that there's  really not a whole lot to say  while the probe is ongoing and insisting there's a  system of checks and balances  the school relies on for incoming international students to make sure all paperwork is on the up-and-up.

The most common infections, according to a CDC survey: pneumonia (22%), surgical site injections (22%), and gastrointestinal infections (17%). Hospitals have curbed the problem somewhat, but throw in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and hospital patients have something to worry about.  Today and every day, more than 200 Americans with healthcare-associated infections will die during their hospital stay,  said CDC Director Tom Frieden. A second CDC report included some good news—that infections from  central lines  inserted in major blood vessels have dropped 44% since 2008, and 10 surgical procedures saw a 20% drop, Medical News Today reports.

"(Nov 25, 2015  3:48 AM) A former National Security Agency employee convicted of selling defense and communication secrets he gained during his career has been released from federal custody 30 years after his arrest. The sentence for Cold War-era spy Ronald Pelton, 74, ended on Tuesday. He had been placed on home confinement several months ago to serve out the final stretch of his sentence and was released Tuesday from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, an agency spokesman says. Pelton, a former NSA intelligence communications specialist, was arrested in November 1985 on charges of selling information to the Soviets about signals intelligence between 1980 and 1985 for $35,000 plus expenses. Pelton worked for 14 years for the NSA before resigning in 1979. The FBI says Pelton, because of financial problems, approached the Soviet Embassy after leaving the agency and offered to sell the secrets. Prosecutors have said a Soviet KGB agent who defected and later returned to Moscow tipped investigators to Pelton. Among the secrets Pelton gave up was information about Operation Ivy Bells, an effort by the NSA and the Navy to tap Soviet communications cables that were laid under the ocean. He was sentenced to three life terms in 1986 by a federal judge who said he had betrayed a  special position of trust,  compromised citizens of the United States, and endangered US agents.

"(Jan 31, 2019  9:15 AM)  When you write my obituary, please don't say that I was accused of treason,  Morton Sobell told the New York Times in 1998. Wish granted. The third figure in the famous 1951 spying case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg—found guilty of conspiracy against the US, a charge Sobell once likened to  talking about espionage —died in Manhattan on Dec. 26, his son confirmed Wednesday, per the Times. He was 101. Overshadowed by his co-defendants, who were executed in 1953, Sobell served almost 18 years of a 30-year sentence in federal prison before his release in 1969. The son of Russian immigrants would maintain his innocence for another four decades before finally admitting to stealing classified military documents for the Soviets beginning at the end of World War II, though he stressed that he provided no information on the atomic bomb, per the Washington Post. Prosecutors alleged the Rosenbergs helped the Soviets replicate the bomb, though many believe their roles in the case were exaggerated. Indeed, Sobell argued Ethel was only guilty  of being Julius' wife.  Sobell, however, was said to have passed military secrets to Julius, his college classmate, while working in General Electric's aircraft and marine engineering division. Sobell eventually fled to Mexico, where he was apprehended in August 1950. In prison, he befriended convicted murderer Robert Stroud. After his release, he worked in medical electronics and developed a low-cost hearing aid.  I thought the USSR was a genuine socialist country and this was the ideal,  he later told the Wall Street Journal of his spying role.

But scientifically speaking, it's the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. That's because it's winter solstice, a day on which most of the US clocks fewer than 10 hours of daylight, reports the Washington Post. (Pity Fairbanks, Alaska, which will log just 3 hours and 42 minutes.) But as far as solstices go, this one will be a little more special than most.

Tens of thousands of people gathered at the site, some of them weeping survivors, some searching for family members. Officials say 600 people have been rescued from the building—which pancaked onto itself and now stands only about two stories tall—but the death toll is expected to rise.  We had sent two people inside the building and we could rescue at least 20 people alive,  a supervisor at one of the garment factories says.  They also told us that at least 100 to 150 people are injured and about 50 dead people are still trapped inside this floor.

"(Sep 25, 2017  12:42 PM CDT) Violent crime in America rose for the second straight year in 2016, but it remained near historically low levels, according to FBI data released Monday. The numbers were driven by a spike in killings in some major cities, per the AP. Violent crimes such as shootings and robberies rose 4.1% in 2016 from the year before, with homicides climbing 8.6%, according to the figures. Violence increased 3.9% in 2015, while killings jumped by more than 10%. The Trump administration immediately seized on the figures as proof that the nation is in the midst of a dangerous crime wave that warrants a return to tougher tactics like more arrests and harsher punishments for drug criminals. But criminologists cautioned the new numbers may not indicate the start of a long-term trend, noting that violent crime rates remain well below where they were a quarter-century ago. Still, the FBI said it was the first time violent crime rose in consecutive years in more than a decade.  This is a frightening trend that threatens to erode so much progress that had made our neighborhoods and communities safer—over 30 years [of] declines in crime are being replaced by increases,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last week. He has directed the nation's federal prosecutors to seek tougher sentences against most suspects, including some low-level drug offenders, and has urged prosecutors to focus more intensely on prosecuting gun cases. Still, the violent crime rate in 2016 was down significantly from several years ago.

Police say senior employees were upset Sagar Barman went into a restricted area of Zobeda Textile Mill in Dhaka. But Sagar's father, also a worker at Zobeda, tells the New York Times his son was killed because he complained about the beatings they received from senior employees over small mistakes. An assistant administrative officer was arrested Monday in connection with Sagar's death, and police are looking for seven more employees said to have been involved. An administrative officer at Zobeda denies Sagar was killed, telling the Dhaka Tribune Sagar may have died when he tried to use the air compressor to clean his mouth. Despite child labor being illegal in Bangladesh, UNICEF estimates there are 4.9 million children under the age of 14 working in factories and elsewhere. Sagar had been working at Zobeda for seven months when he was killed.  I thought, as we are poor, it will be helpful to run our family if my son Sagar can do some work in this factory,  his father tells the Times. Two-dozen child workers were sent home from Zobeda, which supplies yarn for Western clothing, when police came to investigate Sagar's death. It's believed hundreds of children work there.

But now, critics are lambasting that measure, and the ethanol movement in general, for linking skyrocketing food and oil prices.  We used to have a grain economy and a fuel economy,  one analyst tells the Washington Post.  Now they're beginning to fuse.  Now consuming 25% of US corn crops, ethanol is pushing the demand for corn through the roof, and the resultant price increase is rippling through the food industry. Meat and dairy farmers are paying more for their livestock feed, and everything from cereal to soda is hit by corn syrup and cornstarch hikes.

It's the second straight month of strong growth. The Labor Department also said the unemployment rate remained a low 4.9% in July. More Americans launched job searches, and nearly all were hired, but the influx of job seekers meant that the number of unemployed fell only slightly. The headline number of 255,000 came in well above the estimate of 179,000, notes the Wall Street Journal.

In fact, I personally don’t think this number could have possibly been high enough to make that true. However, this report does raise the odds on another hike.  When that happens is the question.

"(Apr 6, 2013  5:37 AM CDT) As far as geological mysteries go, it's an intriguing one: For decades, China has reported being home to 50,000 rivers of at least about 40 square miles. But the country's three-year census of its water—a first-of-its-kind effort involving 800,000 surveyors and released last week—revealed a drastically different count. As of 2011, just 22,909, reports the Verge, which asks the million-dollar question: Why did 27,000 rivers vanish? The answer is an easy one, a census director tells the South China Morning Post: That 50,000 figure was arrived at using topographical maps as many as 60 years old, which were incomplete. The Post cited climate change and water and soil loss as well, but the Verge reports that China itself may have had a heavier hand in the decrease. It spoke with Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, who agreed that the answers offered by the government likely played a role; but he cited pollution and overpopulation as key factors. As the Verge explains, the destruction caused by flooding in the 1960s led the country to erect dams and reservoirs that reined in flooding but messed with the ecological system, causing rivers to go dry.

"(Nov 28, 2012  2:48 AM) Hopes of finding life elsewhere in our solar system have been boosted by a find in one of the least hospitable places on the planet. Researchers who drilled into Lake Vida, a salty lake buried under a 50-foot-thick sheet of ice in Antarctica, have found that its oxygen-depleted water is teeming with microbial life despite having been completely sealed off for 2,800 years, the Los Angeles Times reports. Researchers believe the lake's energy is being regularly replenished, possibly from chemical reactions, despite the lack of external sources.  By seeing what the boundaries of life are on Earth, that helps us when we go out and look for examples elsewhere,  one of the researchers says.  Years ago, we never would have thought to look for life in the sub-surface of Mars, and now we have examples on Earth that things can live down there.",Antarctic Lake Holds Life—Under 50 Feet of Ice
"(Mar 30, 2017  10:22 AM CDT) It's been five years since former Massachusetts State Police chemist Annie Dookhan pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence while working on tens of thousands of criminal cases. But 24,000 people left with questionable convictions as a result of her fraud are still waiting to see if their names will be cleared. Not for much longer, though. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has until April 18 to decide who among the group will be re-prosecuted without evidence touched by Dookhan. And though prosecutors are still deciding on cases, a rep for the Middlesex County District Attorney says the number of convictions that will be kept on the books will likely be  in the hundreds,  per NBC News. In other words, more than 95% of them will be vacated, reports the Boston Globe.  There are no words for it … It's absolutely stunning,  says a member of the National Commission of Forensic Science. While this means some who did commit crimes may see their convictions overturned, it also means those wrongfully convicted will finally get justice, including non-citizens who've been threatened with deportation, defense lawyers say. The ACLU of Massachusetts says that about 90% of the convictions are for misdemeanors or minor felonies, usually involving drug possession, and that most defendants have already finished their sentences.

"(Jul 23, 2014  3:10 AM CDT) The South Carolina single mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play in a park while she worked at McDonald's has been given her daughter back—but has lost her job. The lawyer representing Debra Harrell pro bono says McDonald's has let her go, but he isn't sure why, reports ThinkProgress. A McDonald's spokeswoman declined to comment. Harrell has been charged with unlawful neglect of a child, and her lawyer says that although she has been reunited with her daughter, the Department of Social Services probe is ongoing. According to the blog Reason, Harrell had been bringing her daughter to work and letting her play on a laptop, but she started dropping her off at a nearby park while she worked after their home was broken into and the laptop was stolen. The lawyer tells CNN he thinks it's  absurd  to say the girl was  abandoned  at the park a few minutes' walk from her house.  Because if this woman gets convicted, guess what? ... From now on, do officers now have an obligation every time they see a 9-and-a-half-year-old not in the presence of their parents, do the parents get arrested?  he says.  It truly is the classic slippery slope.

Thousands gathered at the former home of Yasser Arafat to celebrate alongside Palestinian officials. Most prisoners were directed to the West Bank; some 41 were sent to Gaza, and a handful were released to east Jerusalem and Jordan. The International Red Cross assisted in the operation, Israel said. The process, however, didn't go entirely smoothly, CNN reports. At least 20 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were injured in fighting near the prisoners' internment compound prior to the release. An Israeli official cited an  illegal riot,  with the prisoners' families and friends hurling rocks; a Palestinian doctor said Israeli security forces had fired rubber bullets and tear gas. A Palestinian official, meanwhile, called for the freedom of other prisoners, noting that negotiations couldn't resume without an  immediate halt of all settlement activities  and  the recognition of the state borders, including Jerusalem, and the release of all prisoners as agreed to with the previous Israeli government.",Israel Frees Another 550 Palestinians

Brent was returned to jail following the hearing; his lawyer said the $500,000 figure was more than the team had authorized him to post.  I'd say the bond is 16 times higher than it would have been for anybody that doesn't play for the Dallas Cowboys,  he tells CBS. Brown has been charged with intoxication manslaughter, which carries a potential 2- to 20-year sentence.

About 170 miles southeast, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, two bodies were found inside burned-out homes, Calaveras County Coroner Kevin Raggio says. One of the victims was identified as Mark McCloud, 65, who was found inside his residence in the Mountain Ranch area. Raggio wouldn't release the name of the second victim, also found in Mountain Ranch, because the family had not been notified. Raggio says both were found in an area where mandatory evacuations were ordered after the fire burning 60 miles southeast of Sacramento exploded in size over the weekend. Investigators are looking into whether that blaze was sparked after a live tree came in contact with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. power lines. The deaths came in addition to that of an elderly disabled woman whose body was found Sunday in the ruins of her Lake County home about 100 miles north of San Francisco after what a scientist called a  mind-boggling  blaze.

But the brightly-colored paintings and inscriptions are just part of the fascination. The wooden coffins stacked in two layers are sealed just  as the ancient Egyptians left them,  CNN quotes a ministry statement as saying. They were discovered at Asasif, on the west bank of the Nile River in Luxor, not far from the Valley of the Kings. Asasif is home to tombs from both the Late Period (664-332BC) and the 18th Dynasty (1550-1292BC), from which came the rulers Hatshepsut, Akhenaton, and Tutankhamun, per the BBC. More information is to be revealed at a Saturday news conference. It will come just over a week after the ministry announced the discovery of a manufacturing area, firmly dated to the 18th Dynasty, in the Valley of the Monkeys, to the west of the Valley of the Kings, per Reuters. Egyptologists found 30 workshops apparently used to construct funerary furniture and ornaments, a large kiln, a water storage tank used by workers, and various coffin decorations—including some depicting the wings of god Horus, who's associated with death and resurrection.

"(Apr 23, 2019  10:00 AM CDT) Marking a tire with chalk to track how long a car has been parked is unconstitutional, per a first-of-its-kind ruling that could force cities to adopt new approaches to parking enforcement. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals covering Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee on Monday found tire-chalking is an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment, reports the Washington Post. Alison Taylor's lawsuit—brought after she was issued 15 parking tickets in Saginaw, Mich., from 2014 to 2017—was initially dismissed with a US district judge arguing chalk isn't an  information-gathering device,  per NBC News. But while two judges on a three-judge appeals panel agreed that using chalk could be considered a search, all three disagreed it constituted a  reasonable  one, with Judge Bernice Bouie Donald noting tire-chalking was carried out  without probable cause or even so much as 'individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.'  What's more, the  intentional physical contact with Taylor's vehicle  represents a trespass for the purpose of gathering incriminating information, Donald wrote, referencing the 2012 Supreme Court decision that blocked police from attaching GPS devices to vehicles without a warrant. Though the earlier decision had acknowledged an exemption under  community caretaking,  Donald noted there was no justification for a warrantless search as parking violations don't cause  injury or ongoing harm.  The city was essentially raising revenue, she wrote. For some cities, the decision could mean lost revenue or the additional cost of new meters, per the Post. University of Southern California law professor Orin Kerr has a simple suggestion, however.

The FDA allows  compassionate use of unapproved drugs in such cases, but the Chimerix pharmaceutical company had insisted that giving the drug to Josh Hardy, who developed a bone marrow disorder after cancer treatment, would delay efforts to get it to market, CNN reports. Chimerix president Kenneth Moch says Josh will be the first patient in a pilot trial for the drug.  Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,  says Moch, who tells the Fredericksburg Lance-Star that he and his employees have received death threats amid a flood of pleas to help the Virginia boy.

Sohana Jawed, who is in third grade, was on her way to school on Saturday when she was grabbed by two women and forced into a car carrying two men, she said during a news conference. One of the kidnappers reportedly put a handkerchief on her mouth that knocked her unconscious.

Police say the vest contained nearly 20 pounds of explosives that seemed designed to be set off remotely.

"(Apr 26, 2016  5:50 PM CDT) HIV-positive people are aging faster than their HIV-negative peers, putting them at earlier risk of things like dementia, osteoporosis, and heart disease, according to a study published last week in Molecular Cell. Researchers looked at 26,927 DNA tags—called methylation—on the genomes of 137 HIV-positive men; these methylation sites had previously been associated with aging, and in reviewing them, researchers  found a striking association with methylation in the HIV+ patients relative to healthy controls,  they write. Biologist Trey Ideker tells NPR the method used is  better at predicting when someone will die than their chronological age,  and what they found is that men with HIV tended to have a genetic age 4.9 years older than their actual age. Surprisingly, that was true no matter how long the individual had been living with HIV, STAT reports. The nearly five years of advanced aging seen by HIV-positive men corresponds to a 19% increased risk of death. All of the men studied were being treated for HIV, so it's unclear whether it was the HIV or the antiretroviral drugs that accelerated aging. Dr. Howard Fox, the study's lead author, says he hopes the findings will encourage people with HIV to not only stick with treatment but to focus on their health in other ways, such as exercising and maintaining a healthy diet. The findings are also a sign doctors may want to start screening for age-related diseases earlier in patients with HIV. (Charlie Sheen may have actually raised HIV awareness.

"(Jul 14, 2015  1:59 PM CDT) To further attempts to impose longer waiting periods and more stringent restrictions, abortion opponents have long used the argument that women suffer negative mental health after undergoing the procedure. That theory may have just been quashed by a new study that indicates 95% of women who've had an abortion felt their decision was the right one—both immediately afterward and three years later, Think Progress reports. In research published in Plos One that tapped data from the Turnaway longitudinal study, scientists from the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health think tank followed 956 women who sought abortions in 21 states and interviewed them every six months for five years. The study is said to be the first in the US to follow women who had abortions (and those denied them) over time, as well as study differences between women who received first-trimester abortions and those who received them later. Not only did the overwhelming majority of women feel OK with their choice to end the pregnancy, but relief was the emotion they felt most after three years. Emotional intensity overall was reduced as time passed, whether those feelings were positive or negative, the study notes. Women who reported the most negative emotions were those who had ended planned pregnancies (i.e., after finding out the fetus had serious health defects) and those who lived in communities where abortion was more stigmatized, Think Progress notes; meanwhile, women who were working or in school while pregnant felt most comfortable with their decision, per the study. Perhaps most surprising, researchers found  no differences in emotional trajectories or decision rightness between women having earlier versus later procedures.

The BBC reports that the Chinese daredevil, known for posting videos of himself at the top of tall buildings scaled without safety devices, is confirmed to have died in a fall from a 62-story building in Changsha on Nov. 8. The South China Morning Post describes the 26-year-old's life-ending stunt as a somewhat selfless act, saying Wu was undertaking the  rooftopping  challenge in hopes of winning $15,000 in prize money in order to pay for his sick mother's medical treatment, and also to fund a wedding with a woman that his step-uncle says he planned to propose to after the challenge was complete. The Telegraph's explanation of the money is that Wu, who had 1 million followers, was trying to secure it by filming himself promoting an unspecified sponsor. Shanghaiist reports the building was 862 feet tall. The Telegraph describes the more than 300 videos he posted as showing stomach-turning feats like him doing pull-ups from treacherous heights. Indeed, per the Daily Mail, video shows Wu doing pull-ups atop the Huayuan International Centre and then falling; he reportedly plummeted 45 feet to a terrace where a window cleaner later discovered his body.

Goop will settle the suit for $145,000, CBS San Francisco reports. A rep for Goop emphasized that the issue wasn't the products, and that the settlement only related to the advertising claims, which Goop still holds are true.

The league, which made a $5,000 donation to the Republican's US Senate campaign in Mississippi, asked for it back after it was publicized by the Popular Information blog, reports the New York Times.  The contribution was made in connection with an event that MLB lobbyists were asked to attend,  a league spokesman said in a statement, adding that MLB has asked for the donation—which was of the maximum legal amount—to be returned. Hyde-Smith's campaign reported the MLB donation on Nov. 23, well after her controversial joke about a public hanging made the news, though the league says it was made earlier. Walmart, Union Pacific, and other corporate donors have also asked the campaign to return their donations.

"(Jun 28, 2016  12:21 AM CDT) French authorities opened a manslaughter inquiry Monday into the May crash of an EgyptAir plane that killed 66 people, saying there is no evidence so far to link it to terrorism. Prosecutor's office rep Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre says the inquiry was launched as an accident investigation, not a terrorism investigation, the AP reports. She says French authorities are  not at all  favoring the theory that the plane was downed deliberately, though the status of the inquiry could eventually change if evidence emerges to that effect. Investigators decided to start the probe before waiting to analyze the plane's flight data and voice recorders, based on evidence gathered so far, she said, without elaborating. EgyptAir Flight 804, an Airbus A320 en route from Paris to Cairo with 66 people on board, slammed into the Mediterranean on May 19. The reason for the crash remains unclear. The pilots made no distress call and no group has claimed to have brought down the aircraft. An Egyptian official at the ministry of civil aviation says Egyptian authorities haven't been notified of the French prosecutor's decision and that all scenarios remain on the table.  There is no evidence that backs up or rules out any of the possible scenarios of what caused the crash, including whether it is a terrorist act or technical problems,  he says.

"(Oct 17, 2014  12:40 PM CDT) If you've lately found yourself wondering when the worst drought North America has suffered occurred, here's your answer: 1934. At least, as far as the last millennium goes. In a new NASA study, scientists say that a combination of atmospheric conditions (a high pressure ridge off the West Coast that blocked wet weather) and dust storms (the product of grass-eviscerating activities like overfarming and overgrazing that left topsoil susceptible to wind) culminated in the most severe drought in the past 1,000 years. In fact, the Dust Bowl drought of 1934 was so bad that it was 30% worse than the next most severe drought, which occurred in 1580, reports Nature. Scientists drew this conclusion using an analysis of tree rings between the years 1000 and 2005. The 1934 drought extended across 71.6% of Western North America, while the extent of 2012's drought didn't quite reach 60%. As io9 reports, drought led to 14 dust storms in 1932 and 38 in 1933, but farmers kept working the land, expecting rain to return.  As it turns out, the successive dust storms were making the droughts even worse.  NASA explains why:  Dust clouds reflect sunlight and block solar energy from reaching the surface. That prevents evaporation that would otherwise help form rain clouds, meaning that the presence of the dust clouds themselves leads to less rain.  While the agricultural practices that led to those dust storms are no longer used today, scientists say the risk of droughts is only going up, and that agricultural producers will need to adapt accordingly. (The latest drought, meanwhile, is actually causing the West to rise.)",Scientists Pinpoint Worst Drought in 1K Years

"(Jul 6, 2011  12:03 PM CDT) It’s safe to say that Margaret Pavese had no idea she would start a wildfire nearly twice the size of San Francisco when she left a trash fire burning in a metal barrel in 2007—a California wildfire that also burned rare papers written by Albert Einstein, the San Jose Mercury News reports. A jury found Pavese, her husband, and father-in-law guilty of negligence last week and ordered them to pay Dan Straus $750,000 for the loss of his documents. The papers were given to Straus' father, a mathematician who worked with Einstein, and included hand-written calculations on onionskin and an envelope.  I’d much rather have those papers,  Straus said.  But there has been justice.  Straus has a single Einstein document left, which he had kept separate from the others: a handwritten poem Einstein penned to congratulate his parents on his 1954 birth.  This is what I wish: Let Daniel be like his father, thoroughly intelligent and not less joyous. Yours, A. Einstein.  It's now kept in a bank vault. Pavese's father-in-law's attorney plans to seek a new trial, calling the award excessive.

Fawziya Ammodi's poverty-stricken family forced her to drop out of school last year to marry a 24-year-old man.  More than half of Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18—many times to much older men The issue gained prominence last year when a 10-year-old successfully obtained a divorce from an older husband she said beat and raped her within weeks of their marriage. Yemeni legislators have since tried—unsuccessfully—to set the minimum age of marriage at 17, but the practice remains commonplace.","Yemeni Child Bride, 12, Dies in Childbirth"
"(Sep 4, 2012  5:50 AM CDT) American diplomats are close to finalizing a $1 billion bailout package to help save an Egyptian economy battered by political upheaval, reports the Wall Street Journal. The aid package, which includes debt relief and assistance for small- to medium-sized Egyptian businesses, was first announced last year but has been on hold amid diplomatic disagreements on where to allocate the funds and concerns about the Islamist government elected in June. Egypt, facing a $25 billion budget shortfall, has already asked the IMF for $4.8 billion in low-interest loans and secured a $2 billion loan from Qatar. US officials hope the bailout will help stabilize Egypt's economy—and keep the longstanding ally from cozying up to countries like Iran. US officials have made it clear that they expect the Egyptian government to treat all segments of society fairly.  Progress will only be possible if the talents of all citizens are drawn upon and all have a voice—men and women, all religious groups, and all parts of the country,  a State Department official says.",US Planning $1B Egypt Bailout

The sheriff's office says the toddler is being treated for dehydration, but he is in  remarkably good shape,  ABC reports. Capt. Carter Conley of the Magoffin County Rescue Squad says Kenneth was in the yard with his father at around 7:30pm Sunday and disappeared while his dad's back was turned. He was found around 2pm Wednesday when a member of a search team heard his cries. The boy was at the bottom of a 50-foot incline near an old, overgrown strip mine.

Of those 158, 35 were underage, and few were wearing masks, the Guardian reports. The party was held at a vacant house in Palmdale without the owners' knowledge; the teenage organizer allegedly broke in, bringing party equipment in a U-Haul truck. An Instagram ad for the party promised exotic dancers, the Los Angeles Daily News reports. Authorities say the event's organizers have held two other similar gatherings, also in empty homes. Such parties  typically involve drugs, alcohol, weapons, minors and prostitution  and are illegal even when the country is not in the middle of a pandemic, Sheriff Alex Villanueva says. He adds that his department will be further cracking down on such  superspreader events  rather than focusing on businesses, which are currently under restrictions related to the governor's order, KTLA reports. Villanueva estimates at least six such events take place in the county per weekend. Nine weapons were recovered during the raid, and a 17-year-old victim of human trafficking was rescued. The Los Angeles Times reports the sheriff's department was tipped off about the party in advance, but let it go on so that the  elusive  organizers could be arrested.",158 Arrested at Los Angeles 'Superspreader' Party

After a mass civilian trial that began in 2011 and involved 846 defendants, 152 border guards have been sentenced to execution, Reuters and the AP report. Some 161 others are getting life in prison, while 256 have been sentenced to three to 10 years. Another 277 were acquitted, though the BBC reports many of them were convicted in military tribunals and are unlikely to go free. Human Rights Watch criticized the proceedings, noting that 47 suspects died in custody.  Trying hundreds of people en masse in one giant courtroom, where the accused have little or no access to lawyers, is an affront to international legal standards.  The defense plans an appeal, per the AP. The mutiny lasted 30 hours and saw 57 officers killed, with bodies tossed in sewers.  The atrocities were so heinous that even the dead bodies were not given their rights,  said the judge as he read the verdicts, a process that took hours. But he did point out that the soldiers should have indeed been awarded better pay. In earlier military tribunals, some 4,000 people were found guilty and received sentences lasting up to seven years, Reuters reports.","After Mass Trial, Bangladesh to Execute 152"
"(Jul 26, 2019  1:34 AM CDT) Long-distance mountain biker Tomas Quinones initially thought the lump he saw near a dirt road in an extremely remote area of southern Oregon was a dead cow, one of several he had seen that week. If he had arrived at the scene much later, it would have been a dead human. Quinones, a Portland resident who works for a company that makes route-planning software for cyclists, soon realized that he had found a semiconscious, badly sunburned, and dehydrated man who had collapsed.  Once I got a better look at him, I could tell he was in deep trouble,  Quinones tells the AP. There was no cellphone coverage in the high desert region of Lake County, but Quinones was able to summon help by pressing the SOS button on his GPS device. An ambulance turned up an hour later and picked up Gregory Randolph, a 73-year-old man who had collapsed after hiking 14 miles over four days with one of his dogs. Police say Randolph had been exploring the area when his Jeep became stuck in a canyon. One of the two dogs he brought with him was rescued when he was, and the other was found near his Jeep two days later after police used an aircraft to locate the vehicle. Police say Randolph was incredibly lucky that Quinones, who was on a weeklong back-country trip, turned up when he did. Lake County has fewer than 8,000 people in an area almost the size of New Jersey and the road Randolph was found on only sees around one vehicle per week.  The real hero of the story is Mr. Quinones,  a Lake County Sheriff’s Deputy tells the Oregonian.

"(Oct 30, 2017  5:40 PM CDT) Two detectives in the New York Police Department were charged with rape, kidnapping, and official misconduct Monday morning. In a 50-count indictment, the Brooklyn district attorney's office alleges detectives Edward Martins and Richard Hall, while working with an anti-drug squad in the Coney Island neighborhood on Sept. 15, pulled over an 18-year-old woman in her car, the New York Times reports. After searching the car and allegedly finding marijuana and a few Klonopin pills, the detectives handcuffed the woman and put her in their police van. Prosecutor Frank DeGaetano says Martins then forced the woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her while Hall watched through the rearview mirror. Hall then allegedly raped the woman. After the incident the woman had a rape kit conducted and DNA matched both detectives. Martins and Hall pleaded not guilty and were released on bail, and their attorneys called the woman's accusations  uncorroborated  and said the sexual encounter was consensual. Last week the New York Post obtained a letter from the detectives' lawyers to the Brooklyn DA's office attacking the woman's credibility by pointing out a  provocative selfie  she posted on Instagram and a recent tweet is which they say she brags about getting attention from  paparazzi.  But a spokesman for the DA's office attacked the letter, saying the  defense counsel’s characterization of how a rape victim should behave is inaccurate, inappropriate and demeaning.",2 New York Detectives Charged With Raping Teen

Pujols has agreed to a 10-year deal worth between $250 and $260 million, a source tells Yahoo! Sports. Depending on the exact number, it may be the second-biggest baseball contract ever—behind Alex Rodriguez's $275 million deal with the Yankees—and according to ESPN, it includes a full no-trade clause. That handshake had barely been shook when CJ Wilson's agent announced that he too was headed to the Angels, on a five-year, $77.5 million deal.

"(Feb 19, 2020  8:03 AM) After two deadly crashes that killed 346 people, the beleaguered Boeing 737 Max has a new problem, and per a company spokesman, it's an  absolutely unacceptable  one. A routine maintenance check on multiple new planes waiting to be delivered turned up in their fuel tanks  foreign object debris,  which the BBC notes is  any substance, debris, or article that isn't part of a plane [and that] would potentially cause damage.  Per the Guardian, such debris usually consists of metal shavings, rags, tools, or other items left behind in the plane by workers during production. Leeham News, which first reported the development, notes it may take up to three days to inspect each plane, as all fuel has to be drained and the vapors eliminated before inspectors can even enter the fuel tanks to check them out.  FOD is absolutely unacceptable,  Mark Jenks, head of Boeing's 737 program, said in a memo to employees.  With your help and focus, we will eliminate FOD from our production system.  The entire fleet of 400-plus undelivered 737 Max planes is now being inspected, though a Boeing rep tells the BBC it doesn't look like this will further delay getting the 737 Max back in the air; Boeing expects the FAA to recertify the plane to fly again by summer.

"(Sep 10, 2020  4:37 PM CDT) An economist is backing a provocative idea on a COVID vaccine: Anyone who gets a shot should receive $1,000 from the government. So argues Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw in a New York Times op-ed. Mankiw is actually writing in support of a proposal first floated by fellow economist Robert Litan at the Brookings Institution. The thinking goes like this: When a vaccine finally arrives, it won't have maximum effect until enough people get a shot to achieve herd immunity. But that means 70% to 90% will need to be vaccinated, and current polls in the US suggest we won't reach that threshold. Solution: Give people a financial incentive to roll up their sleeves for a shot.  Immunology, meet economics,  writes Mankiw.  One of the first principles of economics—perhaps the most important—is that people respond to incentives.  This proposal is  textbook economics,  he writes, delving into the particulars of  positive externalities  and such. It would be a huge expense, somewhere around $300 billion, but that is actually a  bargain  when compared to previous and proposed relief packages, Litan asserts. Mankiw adds that Congress can worry about lowering the government debt once the pandemic subsides. He ends with a suggestion to apply the principle elsewhere:  Perhaps after seeing how a vaccine subsidy can end one crisis, Congress will pay for it by adopting a carbon tax to avert another.

The agency's  Crime in the United States  report shows murder and non-negligent manslaughter down 4.4% to 14,196 (the lowest it's been since 1968), with rape down 6.3% and robbery down 2.8%, Reuters reports. The violent crime rate overall, which decreased 5.1% from 2012, has fallen every year since 1994; that 2013 rate of 367.9 per 100,000 people was about half of 1994's. And while the number of murders and violent crimes fell in Detroit, that didn't stop it from being named the most dangerous city in the country, the Detroit News reports. Various factors have been correlated with this steady nationwide reduction in violent crime. Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox tells Reuters that an older population, better policing, and more security cameras seem to have had an effect. He also says the ubiquity of cellphones may also play a role:  It's hard for criminals to do anything without being caught on video.  The number of US prisoners has also fallen in tandem with violent crime reduction, falling 6% last year compared to 2008, reports Pew Charitable Trusts, as per Reuters: Thirty-two states have experienced falling crime rates as the imprisonment rate dropped, with California claiming the largest imprisonment-rate reduction (15% over five years) and a crime-rate reduction of 11%.

"(Oct 5, 2016  7:51 AM CDT) A Utah couple got a surprise—and a laugh—when they got the bill for the birth of their son, Samuel. Tucked below the charge for  Delivery C Section  was a $39.35 fee for  skin to skin,  their fee for getting to hold the baby after delivery, explains Vox.  Really.  In a post on Reddit that has gone viral, user  halfthrottle  writes:  During the C-section the nurse asked my wife if she would like to do skin to skin after the baby was born. Which of course anyone would say yes (to). We just noticed it in the bill today and had a laugh.  The new dad was unmasked as Ryan Grassley, who told PIX11 that he found the bill to be  funny and a bit ridiculous  and decided to share on Tuesday, where it had picked up 2.8 million views in 24 hours. In the comments, a delivery-room nurse explained that  'skin to skin' in the operating room requires an additional staff member to be present … and make sure the baby is safe.  Grassley pointed out that he and his wife were happy with the care they received at the Provo hospital in September.  I was able to hold the baby on my wife's chest … and the nurse was there to remind me not to let go so the baby didn't fall. She actually took my camera from me and started snapping pictures for me.  At least Grassley has a sense of humor: He started a crowd-funding campaign to pay off the $39.35 with any additional donations  put towards a vasectomy because I never want to go though (sic) these sleepless new baby nights again.

"(May 12, 2016  12:11 AM CDT) A man who killed two people in a drug dispute and a sheriff's deputy in a subsequent shootout was put to death Wednesday in what could be Missouri's last execution for some time. Earl Forrest died by injection for the December 2002 deaths of Harriett Smith, Michael Wells, and Dent County Sheriff's Deputy JoAnn Barnes. The 66-year-old Forrest declined to make a final statement. The execution was delayed about an hour, partly because of severe weather in the area. Tornado sirens sounded at one point. As the execution began, Forrest mouthed words to his adult daughter, who was among the witnesses. He stopped speaking within seconds of being injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital, but showed no outward signs of distress, the AP reports.  We know this execution will not bring JoAnn back, but it destroyed an evil person that otherwise would be still walking this earth,  the deputy's family members said in a statement. Forrest's fate was sealed hours earlier when the US Supreme Court refused to halt the execution and Democratic Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon turned down a clemency request. The execution, Missouri's 19th since November 2013, brings the state's death row population down to 25 men, none of whom face imminent execution. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, says the death penalty is withering in the state because fewer people are being sentenced to death. No one at all was sentenced to death in Missouri in 2014 or 2015, he says. (Nationwide, executions are at their lowest level in decades.)",Missouri Executes Man for 2002 Triple Murder

A police spokesman said Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, were arrested at a home just north of Tulsa about 2am today and were expected to be charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of shooting with intent to kill. He said police acted on an anonymous tip. While police identified the men as white and all the victims are black, authorities have not described the shootings as racially motivated. Community leaders, however, expressed concern—as well as relief at the arrests.  The community once again can go about its business without fear of there being a shooter on the streets, on Easter morning,  says the president of Tulsa NAACP.

The staggeringly high figure was arrived at by calculating the cost of treatment and the lost earnings of the 32,000 people who killed themselves in Japan last year, the BBC reports. The country has one of the world's highest suicide rates—more than twice as high as America's—and there have been more than 30,000 suicides a year for over a decade. The high suicide rate is a product of and a partial cause of the country's long economic stagnation, say experts.  It would be impossible to eradicate all suicides at once, but that would have a much bigger impact  on the economy than a huge stimulus package the government plans to announce this week, one Japanese economist tells BusinessWeek.

Poul Nielson, a Danish politician given the task last year of preparing a labor market report for the Nordic Council of Ministers, puts forth  Proposal 7,  which states that the  Nordic governments should commit to the principle of mandatory adult and continuing training for everybody in the labor markets  in that area of the world.  The combination of rapid technological development with the gradual increase in retirement age increases the need for new forms of education,  he tells the EuObserver, noting people in their 60s may still have five to 10 more years in which they'll be collecting a paycheck. And while Nielson says it would be  visionary  for Nordic countries to adopt this proposal, which doesn't define how long or how often adults would have to submit to schooling, he's aware there will be critics and  expects many misgivings, conflicts of interest, and not least major difficulties when it comes to the allocation of costs and rights,  as the Nordic Labour Journal notes. But he points out the creation of a common Nordic workforce in 1954 was a similarly  out of the box  move and that having all adults of working age well-trained will help the region remain competitive globally.

The Guardian reports that few details about the girl are available for legal reasons. The father is believed to be a minor as well, a few years older than the girl. Police are investigating the situation. The age of consent in Britain is 16, the Huffington Post reports. Britain's current youngest mother was 12 when she gave birth in 2014; her baby is being raised by its 28-year-old grandmother. Britain's youngest father was 12 years old when his son was born in 1998. Meanwhile, one of Britain's former youngest mothers, Tressa Middleton, who gave birth at the age of 12 in 2006, is expecting another child, Metro.co.uk reports.

The Obama administration announced a $1.8 billion arms package sale to Congress on Wednesday, Reuters reports, including guided-missile frigates, anti-tank missiles, Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and $416 million worth of guns, ammo, and other supplies. The announcement came amid reports that the US had stalled the sale to avoid hearing about it from China, which still claims Taiwan as a territory, per the Wall Street Journal. Reuters notes the sale comes as US-China relations simmer over the latter's man-made islands in the South China Sea and US patrols in those waters. China notes it's going to sanction the companies involved in the sale (including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon), with a foreign ministry official telling Xinhua that the sale flouts international rules and  severely  damages China's sovereignty.  China's government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies,  a ministry spokesman says. A Pentagon spokesman gave the equivalent of an eyeroll Wednesday, per the New York Times, noting,  The Chinese can react to this as they see fit. … It's a [clear-eyed], sober view of an assessment of Taiwan's defense needs. … There's no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with China.

As Carpenter writes on a GoFundMe page, she speculates about possible contributing factors: the plane, entering an environment full of allergens that were new to her, the area's large feral cat population, pesticide runoff in the pool from an adjacent golf course, or a bronchial spasm caused by the pool's temperature.

On Wednesday, South Korean officials said they had topped the US and China, achieving the first commercial launch of a fifth-generation telecoms network after connecting to a 5G phone. AT&T and Verizon didn't take that well, Reuters reports. AT&T answered later that day, saying it already won when it announced in December that it was kicking off its 5G network in 12 US cities. However, that network can only be accessed by using a mobile hotspot device, not just a 5G phone. Verizon then argued that it was first because it has launched a 5G network that's available only on a new Motorola phone, and only in Chicago and Minneapolis. The stakes are high. The technology is billed as providing data speeds at least 20 times that of 4G and will fuel other advances like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. One estimate has it generating $12.3 trillion in annual revenue across a variety of industries by 2035. But at the moment, 5G is still more talk than reality, per the Verge. AT&T released test results showing its network is fastest, but those results could be misleading. And Verizon's rollout suffers from poor coverage.

But Salem thinks he was worth more, and notes that one exec at a cocktail party told him he was a  steal  at $15 million.

"(Jul 12, 2012  7:48 AM CDT) The Americas weren't initially populated in one sweeping migration across the land bridge from Siberia, but in three distinct waves, according to a new DNA study. By comparing genetic markers on 52 modern day Native American populations and 17 Siberian ones, they've concluded that while the Americas were mostly populated in an initial wave 15,000 years ago, two smaller subsequent migrations brought the Eskimos, Aleutians, and the Na-Dene speaking peoples, the Wall Street Journal reports. The three-migration theory was first put forth by linguist Joseph Greenberg in 1987, and has been hotly debated ever since, the New York Times explains. The DNA study is the most comprehensive yet on the topic.  This is monumental work,  says one anthropologist, praising  the enormity of the database and the global approach.  The study largely vindicates Greenberg, but whereas Greenberg imagined three completely distinct groups, the study shows that later waves intermingled with the first; Eskimos, for instance, inherit about half their genes from first-wavers.",First Americans Arrived Via Land Bridge in 3 Waves

According to ABC News, 39-year-old Anne Monoky Goldman was pushing two of her children, ages 4 and 2, in a stroller while her 41-day-old infant was strapped to her chest Aug. 15 in Central Park when a 75-foot-tall elm tree fell on them. Monoky Goldman was pinned under the tree for 10 minutes or so before being rescued.  They had to go take her out with chainsaws,  a witness told the New York Daily News at the time. Her lawyers say she suffered spine and neck injuries and a concussion. Her 2-year-old son was treated for a brain hemorrhage and concussion. In the lawsuit filed this week, lawyers claim the tree fell because it was decayed underground, posed a danger to all park visitors, and hadn't been properly maintained or inspected. Monoky Goldman was released from the hospital last week, but her lawyers say she has to lay flat in bed for the next two to three months while her neck fractures heal. They say she may not be able to walk again.  She can't pick up her baby, she can't breast-feed, she can't do her job  doing social media for Tory Burch, one attorney tells the Daily News.

"(Jul 8, 2017  2:30 PM CDT) President Trump stood out Saturday as the only G20 leader not offering his support for the Paris climate agreement, but that wasn't the only buzzworthy happening in Hamburg with the name  Trump  attached to it. Per Bloomberg, when the president slipped away from a meeting on migration that included such world leaders as UK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, another Trump slipped quietly into his seat. A spokesman for Ivanka Trump concedes the first daughter, who'd been sitting in the back of the room, did briefly take the place of the president (who'd gone off to some one-on-one meetings with other leaders) at the table of global bigwigs, though an official who saw the seat swapping take place says Ivanka didn't say anything during her time at the table. A photo of Ivanka sitting between Xi and May, with Merkel a few seats down, was first posted on Twitter (and then removed) by Svetlana Lukash, who calls herself a  Russian G20 Sherpa,  per CNN. Critics are upset that the unelected Ivanka stepped in for her father in a move the Washington Post calls  somewhat unusual,  as heads of state in such situations are usually replaced by senior government officials. The Hill notes reaction online, with some calling the move by the  inexperienced  Ivanka  banana-republicky,  others snarking the summit wasn't  Take Your Daughter to Work day,  and some noting Ivanka had said just last month:  I try to stay out of politics.  Per Bloomberg, though, other leaders' aides took their place when they stepped out (Ivanka is an unpaid adviser to her father), and Merkel later noted each country's delegation decides who represents them, and  Ivanka Trump was part and parcel of the American delegation.",Ivanka's 'Somewhat Unusual' G20 Move Has Internet Abuzz
"(Apr 21, 2016  6:57 PM CDT) A Florida man who piloted a one-person gyrocopter through some of the most restricted US airspace and landed on the lawn of the Capitol last year, was sentenced Thursday to 120 days in jail, the AP reports. Douglas Hughes, 62, has said his April 15, 2015, flight in the bare-bones aircraft was a way to call attention to the influence of big money in politics. The former mail carrier was carrying letters for each member of Congress on the topic of campaign finance and the tail of his aircraft had a postal service logo. Hughes pleaded guilty in November to a felony of operating a gyrocopter without a license. Prosecutors had asked for 10 months in prison, arguing that his flight from Pennsylvania to the nation's capital put countless lives at risk. Hughes' attorneys had said that he should be allowed to remain out of jail. In a statement to the court they underscored that no one was injured as a result of Hughes' flight. They called the stunt an  act of aerial civil disobedience  and a  freedom flight  and said it  was in the nation's proud tradition of nonviolent civil disobedience.   The attention his flight gained, Mr. Hughes hopes, will force the nation to finally confront the issue of campaign finance rather than continue to ignore the problem. For this reason, Mr. Hughes should be considered a hero for his conduct,  his attorneys wrote. Hughes was sentenced in federal court in Washington by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. (His 535 letters on campaign finance reform were never delivered to Congress.)",Man Who Landed Gyrocopter on Capitol Lawn Gets 4 Months in Jail
"(Feb 13, 2017  1:02 AM) More than 100,000 people fled their homes in northern California on Sunday as an emergency spillway next to America's tallest dam threatened to collapse and unleash what authorities called a catastrophic amount of water along the Feather River. While the evacuation took place, emergency repairs were performed on the spillway at the 770-foot Oroville Dam, with helicopters dropping rock-filled containers, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The cities of Oroville, Yuba City, and Marysville were among those under mandatory evacuation orders. Saturday, when a hole developed in the main spillway, was the first time the emergency spillway was used since the dam was completed in 1968. Authorities say the dam itself remains structurally sound, reports the Los Angeles Times. Officials said Sunday night that the immediate danger was subsiding because the level of the man-made Lake Oroville had dropped below the level of the emergency spillway for the first time in more than 24 hours, the Sacramento Bee reports. But authorities warned that the danger of catastrophic flooding remains, with the main spillway still in danger of collapse because water was released so quickly along it to relieve pressure on the auxiliary spillway, causing further erosion. The AP reports that the evacuation order covered 188,000 people in Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties and that people were stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic out of the area more than five hours after the order was issued.",More Than 100K Evacuated Near America's Tallest Dam

Or so learned a Kansas couple, who say they may be on the hook for a $132,000 sculpture their young son knocked over. ABC News reports that while at the Tomahawk Ridge Community Center in Overland Park for a May 19 wedding reception, the 5-year-old was caught reaching toward the sculpture by surveillance cameras;  Aphrodite di Kansas City  toppled over and fell. Then the other shoe dropped, in the form of an insurance claim for $132,000—the piece's list price—from the company that insures the city. Sculptor Bill Lyons says he spent roughly 2 years creating the glass piece and that his inspection of it revealed damage to the head and arms. It is  beyond my capabilities and desires to rebuild it,  Lyons says.  You’re responsible for the supervision of a minor child ... your failure to monitor could be considered negligent,  the letter from the insurance company read in part. Mom Sarah Goodman counters that the whole scenario was dangerous, and not because of her child.  He didn’t maliciously break that. It fell on him. It was not secure, it was not safe—at all.  As for what he was doing, she tells the Kansas City Star  he probably hugged it ... because he’s a loving, sweet nice boy who just graduated from preschool.  Overland Park says the piece was on loan and it was obligated to file an insurance claim, and the insurance company was subsequently obligated to contact the family.

In his promised big announcement, which he made via YouTube video today, Trump started by noting that he is  very honored to have gotten [Obama] to release his long-form birth certificate—or whatever it may be.

"(Jul 19, 2019  6:39 AM CDT) The man accused of setting fire to an anime studio in Japan, killing at least 33 people in one of the country's deadliest postwar mass murders, has been identified as Shinji Aoba. The 41-year-old man is being treated for burns in a hospital and police have so far been unable to question him, reports the BBC. His motive is unclear, though witnesses say they heard him complain that Kyoto Animation had plagiarized his novel before he splashed flammable liquid from a bucket and set it on fire. CCTV footage reportedly shows Aoba buying gas in containers from a nearby station before the attack. Kyoto Animation president Hideaki Hatti says the studio recently received threatening letters, though he doesn't know whether they were from the suspect. Aoba would not have been able to enter the studio building if he had chosen a different day, the Asahi Shimbun reports. Hatti says people normally need ID cards to enter the building, but the system was temporarily deactivated Thursday because of a meeting involving outside guests. Experts say nature of the blaze and the construction of the building—which did not have sprinklers, and wasn't required to under Japan's fire code—may have contributed to the high number of deaths. They say a spiral staircase leading from the first to the third floors would have acted as a  chimney,  causing fire and smoke to spread with terrifying speed. Nineteen bodies were found piled on top of each other on stairs between the third floor and roof; Kyodo reports the door was shut but could reportedly be opened from the roof side.

International Organization for Migration staffers found the shallow graves of 29 of the migrants on a beach in Shabwa during a routine patrol, the agency's statement said. The dead were buried by those who survived. At least 22 migrants remained missing, the IOM said. The passengers' average age was around 16, the agency said.

"(Jun 11, 2015  8:56 AM CDT) A Guardian project that's compiling killings by US police says we're right on track to hit more than 1,000 such deaths by year's end, because we've already hit the midpoint. The newspaper's The Counted project, an interactive database that the Guardian says uses both reporting and confirmed crowdsourced info, indicates 500 people have already died at the hands of police in 2015, after two black men in New York and Cincinnati were shot this week. These numbers are more than double the latest rate compiled by the FBI (461 in 2013), which manages a  voluntary  reporting system where police agencies can send in numbers of  justified homicides.  In those first 500 deaths, 49.6% of the individuals were white, 28.2% were black, and 14.8% were Hispanic/Latino. Only 4.8% were women. How that stacks up against America's makeup: As of the 2013 census, we were 62.6% white, 13.2% black, and 17.1% Hispanic/Latino. And there's a definite imbalance among those who were unarmed: Per the paper's stats, 30.5% of black people were unarmed, while just 16.1% of white people were (the unarmed total is 108 of the 500). The executive director of Amnesty International USA told the Guardian earlier this month that the  startling  disparity between unarmed blacks and unarmed whites shows we need to  get to the bottom of why you're twice as likely to be shot if you're an unarmed black male.

Just send in your résumé, spend an average of 15 hours interviewing, and score in the top 5% worldwide on competency tests, and maybe you'll get hired. Fortune reports the Australian app-development company re-engineered its approach after calculating that only about half its hires ended up working out. Fast Company details the current hiring process: It all begins with the company imagining an ideal hire. Then, an HR person sifts through résumés and holds phone interviews; some 10% to 20% of applicants will be sent on to the next step. Some 70% of those people will then be cut in competency tests that require them to score in that top 5% bracket, co-founder Josiah Humphrey tells Fast Company. Next is a half-day interview, followed by an additional three-to-five-hour one. In that second meeting, one of the two interviewers spends the time examining your body language. And you might be asked to come in and do a trial workday. Of course, the team is also investigating your references behind the scenes, and the process involves about 22 hours of work for them per candidate.  You start seeing glimmers of people's personalities they can't hide, things you would never be able to see in a traditional job interview,  co-founder Mark McDonald told Business Insider in November. The goal, he says, is to ensure hires (50 of its 130 employees joined in the past three months) stay on for the long haul, and about 90% now do. A common thread shared by those who get the job? The ability to freely and extensively talk about one's career; Fortune reports this tends to indicate the candidate is qualified and has no skeletons in his or her employment closet.

The recall affects meat dating to Feb. 1 that originated in Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. The company distributes beef to major fast-food chains, as well as the federal school lunch program.  Because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection, Food Safety and Inspection Service has determined them to be unfit for human food,  said Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer, who added that Westland/Hallmark often did not notify vets when cows that had passed inspection became crippled, a violation.

I would like to express our condolences, support and the pain we are feeling for the human drama that the family of those who were on board are currently experiencing,  Chilean Defense Minister Alberto Espina said at a press conference Thursday, per CNN. Search crews have been combing the Antarctic, and Chilean authorities confirmed at the press conference human remains that  likely belonged  to passengers have been recovered, per Air Force Commander in Chief General Arturo Merino Nunez.  The condition of the remains makes leads us to conclude that it is practically impossible that anyone survived this accident,  he said. Continued Espina,  Our duty is to, first of all, find all the remains and everything we can on the plane. Secondly, to do everything humanly possible so that there is no doubt about what happened in this accident.  The four-engine C-130 Hercules transport aircraft was carrying 32 members of the Chilean Air Force, three members of the Chilean Army, and three civilians—two employees of a private construction company and one university official, per CBS News. It lost radio contact near the Drake Passage, the body of water between South America's southern tip and Antarctica. It had taken off from the Chilean capital of Santiago before making a brief stop in Punta Arenas, near the tip; it was about 390 nautical miles from Punta Arenas and 280 nautical miles from the country's Eduardo Frei base when it disappeared.

Within seconds, a stun grenade smashed through a window, exploding over the couch. Armed, black-clad and masked police officers swarmed into the living room and, moments later, Aiyana lay bleeding to death with a gunshot wound to her head.  As soon as they came in, their guns were just pointing right there, and he pulled the trigger,  Aiyana's grandmother, Mertilla Jones, 50, said today during the Detroit police officer Joseph Weekley's involuntary manslaughter trial. The May 2010 nighttime raid was in search of murder suspect who lived upstairs in the unit, and the cops were being shadowed by a crew from reality TV show The First 48. Weekley has said his gun accidentally fired when Jones bumped into him or grabbed it. But Jones testified she rolled onto the floor after the noise and flash from the grenade, and was on her stomach when Weekley stormed in. Last week, a neighbor testified that he tried to tell officers before they raided the home that children were inside. Under cross-examination today, Jones said the officers were negligent.

Obama’s plan does indeed jack up the rates on those tax brackets, but for many those increases won’t take their federal taxes above the Alternative Minimum Tax level they’ve been paying for years, the New York Times reports. Those in the upper income echelons must calculate both their normal federal taxes, and their AMT, then pay whichever is higher. For the modestly wealthy, the AMT will likely remain higher, or extremely close. The tax hike will really hit those making much more.

The move has shocked the art world and drawn heavy criticism from museum and university professionals.  This is not a happy day in the history of Brandeis,  the school's president admitted. There is no precedent for selling off a collection as impressive as that of the Rose Art Museum, which includes works by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and Roy Lichtenstein—and the university is selling as prices for art continue to fall. The closing was announced as the Rose searched for a new chief curator, and the museum's director only learned of the sale last night.

It was the deadliest attack in the region in at least 20 years. Israeli officials and Egyptian media blamed the attack on Islamist militants, a notion dismissed by Hamas in Gaza, AFP reports.

According to a new study in Australia, parents with at least four children get the most satisfaction out of life despite the chaos and higher expenses, the Daily Signal reports.  With large families, we think they have social support within the family,  study lead Bronwyn Harman tells ABC News Australia.  The kids are never bored, they have someone to play with and they get independence quite early on.  She interviewed 950 parents over a 5-year period to evaluate their happiness level, Yahoo reports, and asked them about self-esteem, social support, and resilience. While parents with big families did have issues—like people asking if the kids had multiple fathers—they were still the most satisfied. Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but  they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate,  she says. Second-happiest (by a razor-thin margin of 0.25%) were LGBT parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, IVF, or adoption.  These children are not accidents ... so the child is very much desired,  says Harmon. The least happy in her still-unpublished study were single dads, who she says are often seen as lesser parents and struggle to play a role in their childrens' lives.  There is this perception that mothers are the real parents and fathers just sort of help,  Harmon tells the Sydney Morning Herald.

"(May 30, 2018  4:40 PM CDT) Japan says it killed 333 minke whales, including 122 pregnant females, at its controversial annual hunt last summer. The hunt is, as always, under fire for its lack of apparent connection to legitimate scientific research and for killing whales rather than taking a non-lethal survey (Japan says its aim is to show the whale population is healthy). This year's 12-week expedition, in which whales were killed using harpoons fitted with explosives, has also been particularly criticized for the number of pregnant females that were killed. Of the 128 mature females killed, 95.3% were pregnant, reports the Guardian. The expedition was detailed in a report to the International Whaling Commission.  The killing of 122 pregnant whales is a shocking statistic and sad indictment on the cruelty of Japan’s whale hunt,  a Humane Society International program manager says in a statement. Whether Japan’s whale hunts are legal is a bit murky, notes the New York Times. Under a 1946 international ruling, countries may kill whales for scientific research. In 2014, an international court found Japan's whale hunt was for commercial purposes, not scientific, and temporarily banned the country from whaling in the Antarctic Ocean; a year later Japan began a new program that reduced the number of whales it kills by two-thirds and that, per Japan, has a scientific purpose. But experts contend the new program is still for profit; the whale meat is eventually sold as food.  They’ve sought to exploit this loophole,  one legal expert tells the NYT. Japan says that aside from research purposes, whale hunting is an important part of its culture, notes the BBC. Other countries still hunt whales for meat, but only Japan hunts whales in Antarctica under the scientific research exemption.

"(Dec 12, 2015  11:30 AM) There has yet to be a confirmed US collision between a drone and a manned aircraft, but there's a growing number of close calls as drones fly where they least belong—near airports. A report released Friday counted at least 241 reports of close encounters between drones and manned aircraft that meet the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of a near-collision, including 28 incidents in which pilots had to veer out of the way. The analysis by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone found that 90 of the close drone encounters involved commercial jets. The FAA defines a near-collision as two aircraft flying within 500 feet of each other. In 51 of the incidents studied, the drone-to-aircraft clearance was 50 feet or less, the report said. Most of the sightings occurred within 5 miles of an airport and at altitudes higher than 400 feet. Those are spaces in which the FAA prohibits drones from flying, raising questions about the effectiveness of the rules. The cities with the most incidents were New York, Newark, Los Angeles, and Miami. The report is based on an analysis of government records detailing 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft between Dec. 17, 2013 and Sept. 12, 2015. Researchers cautioned that it's hard for pilots to judge their distance from another object when flying at high speeds. The majority of the incidents, 64%, were sightings of drones in the vicinity of other aircraft with no immediate threat of collision. The Bard report is the first comprehensive analysis of the sightings by researchers outside the aviation community.","Report: 90 'Near Collisions' Between Drones, Commercial Jets"

The strange story comes out of Tuba City, Arizona, where a group of friends rigged a GoPro camera, a camcorder, and a Samsung Galaxy Note II phone to a weather balloon to record shots of the Grand Canyon in 2013. All was well until they tried to use the Note's GPS to retrieve their carefully made package after it returned to solid ground.  The problem was that the coverage map we were relying on (looking at you, AT&T) was not accurate, so the phone never got signal as it came back to Earth, and we never heard from it,  one of the friends explains on Reddit.

Now that policy is being extended, with an announcement Monday from the State Department that more US funds will be withdrawn worldwide, affecting around $8.8 billion in health funding and pulling resources away from clinics that combat AIDS and malaria (among other issues), especially in Africa, the New York Times reports. Any international nongovermental groups wanting US financial assistance will now have to sign off on the  Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance  mandate, per NBC News. The State Department says any funds that are taken away from one group will be redistributed to others that agree to the terms, keeping the foreign aid level relatively the same. The expanded mandate means groups who want US money must not  promote abortion as a method of family planning.  The gag rule ups the amount being affected from between $520 million and $600 million under former President George W. Bush to about $8.8 billion, with public health advocates noting funding will be severed in places that need it most, such as West Africa.

"(Mar 5, 2012  11:43 AM) If you just can't take any more of this today, here's a bittersweet story to warm your heart: After surviving for 53 days in the Nevada desert, a Shetland sheepdog named Dooley was reunited with his loving owner last month. Dooley ran from a Dec. 27 car accident that severely injured owner Barbara Bagley and her husband and killed the couple's other dog. A search was organized, but called off Jan. 6—the same day Bagley's husband died from his injuries—when remains, thought to be Dooley's, were found near the interstate. Even so, Bagley believed Dooley was still alive; he was spotted near the accident scene more than three weeks later, then again in mid-February. Finally, searchers were able to corner a skittish Dooley, who had dropped from 44 pounds to 20 pounds.  When Barbara opened the door and looked at him, she said, 'My beautiful boy, my beautiful boy, you're home,'  says one of the rescuers.  Oh, boy, all of us cried.  Says Bagley,  It's a message from my husband who was looking out for him. … He's the physical and mental affection that I need to recover.

"(Apr 16, 2016  1:20 PM CDT) An incredibly rare and valuable stamp stolen right out of its exhibition frame at a 1955 convention resurfaced this month in New York and has promptly rocked the philatelic world.  Inverted Jenny  stamps are considered the most famous in America: A printing accident in 1918 produced a single sheet of 100 of the stamps, each featuring an upside-down Curtiss JN-4H biplane, NPR explains. In 1955, someone swiped a block of four from the collection of Ethel Stewart McCoy, whose father was a Dow Jones founder. It is  one of the most notorious crimes in philatelic history,  Scott English, administrator of the American Philatelic Research Library, tells the AP. The stamp was submitted this month to New York auction house Spink USA by an unnamed man in his 20s who hails from the UK and says he inherited it from his grandfather; it's unclear if he knew it was stolen. A press release from Spink USA states that the inverted Jenny was  determined to be position 76 in the pane of 100 subjects —the one in the bottom right of the block of four stolen. Identification took some sleuthing: In a long-ago attempt to disguise it, the stamp  had been reperforated at right and most of the gum was removed, so the pencil position numbers written on the gummed side had been lost.  Positions 75 and 65 turned up in 1958 and 1982, respectively, and the new discovery leaves only one of the four stolen stamps unaccounted for. (In 2014, a dealer offered a $50,000 reward for the missing inverted Jennies.) The American Philatelic Research Library at the American Philatelic Society was given rights to the stamps by McCoy, who died in 1980, and is working with the auction house to take possession of the stamp. (By one measure, this stamp is the most expensive thing ever sold.)",'Inverted Jenny' Stamp Surfaces 61 Years After It Was Stolen
"(Dec 11, 2015  6:00 PM) What's wrong with giving your family hundreds of Christmas gifts? Quite a bit, according to reaction one mom received on social media. Emma Tapping, a married mother of three, posted a photo of her family Christmas tree nearly buried under more than 300 gifts. She then saw the image shared thousands of times, often with nasty comments about materialism and spoiled children, UPI reports.  The way I see it is you can buy your kids two presents or 200 presents—it's the way you bring them up,  Tapping said when defending herself on the British TV show This Morning.  My kids know the difference between right and wrong, they appreciate everything they get, and they don't get spoiled throughout the year.  The 35-year-old Isle of Man resident says she shopped all year, hunted for bargains, accrued no debt, and spent about $2,276, the Mirror reports. Enter the critics:  It's nearly time for all the materialistic parents to compete and broadcast how many presents their kids have on Facebook,  someone wrote on a shared version of Tapping's photo, per Buzzfeed. Others believe Tapping's kids are  suffering some form of abuse because they are being paid for their love in gifts and presents,  says This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby. And some call Tapping (who blogs about bargain shopping) an attention-seeker, but she sees it differently, the BBC reports.  I'm not 'insta-famous'—I've only got a couple of hundred followers and I didn't think anything of it,  she says of her post.  I think how I spend my money on my children is my choice.

She literally fell out of the sky into a dark hole and didn't have anybody but her own will to live and get help for her family,  a police rep tells the AP.  Absolutely amazing.  In the silence in the wake of the crash, Sailor Gutzler didn't know if her mom, dad, sister, and cousin were dead or just unconscious. So, clad in shorts, a T-shirt, and a lone sock, she made the three-quarter-mile trek in near-freezing conditions to Larry Wilkins' home to get help. He describes her thusly:  bloody nose, bloody arms, bloody legs, one sock, no shoes, crying.   She's a brave little girl, extremely,  Wilkins tells Sky.  She done a hell of a job as far as I'm concerned.  The NTSB has arrived on the scene and is investigating the cause of the crash, reports ABC; dad Marty Gutzler, 48, was an experienced pilot and certified flight instructor.  He loved flying,  says a family friend.  You didn't have a conversation with Marty without him talking about flying.  Meanwhile, neighbors in the Gutzler family's hometown of Nashville, Ill., are grieving the loss of Marty Gutzler, as well as Sailor's mom, Kimberly, 46; sister Piper, 9; and cousin Sierra Wilder, 14.

"(Jul 16, 2012  3:49 AM CDT) Sea piracy worldwide fell by 54% in the first half of 2012, led by a dramatic drop in Somali piracy, according to an international maritime watchdog. The International Maritime Bureau attributed the sharp drop to  pre-emptive and disruptive counter piracy tactics  by international navies patrolling in seas off Somalia as well as increased vigilance by ships, more of which now have private armed personnel on board. The bureau said 177 attacks were reported worldwide from January to June, down from 266 in the same period last year. It said 20 vessels were hijacked worldwide, with 334 crew members taken hostage and at least four crew members killed. Attacks off Somalia's coast plunged to 69 in the first half of this year, down from 163 over the same period a year ago, it said. Somali pirates also hijacked fewer vessels with 13 seized, down from 21.  The naval actions play an essential role in frustrating the pirates.

"(Oct 19, 2017  4:54 PM CDT) On Thursday, President Trump gave himself perfect marks for the federal government's response to the ongoing disaster in Puerto Rico, USA Today reports.  I'd say it was a 10,  Trump told reporters during a meeting with Gov. Ricardo Rossello of Puerto Rico. According to the Washington Post, Trump called rendering aid to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria  probably the most difficult  disaster response in history.  It was in many ways worse than anything people have ever seen,  the president said, adding,  It was worse than Katrina.  (Trump has previously said Hurricane Maria wasn't a  real catastrophe  like Katrina.) Trump said the response in Puerto Rico has been hampered by damaged ports and roadways, already-poor infrastructure, and  corruption on the island.  Rossello was also asked to give his assessment of the government's response to Maria—specifically by Trump, who wanted to know,  Did we do a great job?   You responded immediately, sir,  Rossello answered. The governor also tried to deflect some of the criticism away from Trump, the Guardian reports.  We didn’t have the ports open for a couple of days,  Rossello said.  We didn’t have the airports open at full capacity until about a day or two ago.  Recent polls show the rest of the US might not share Trump's optimistic assessment of the situation in Puerto Rico. One poll found less than a third of the country approved of his handling of relief efforts; in another poll, 36% of people said Trump hadn't done enough for Puerto Rico, where more than one-third of houses still lack running water and less than a fifth of the power grid has been restored.",Trump on Puerto Rico Response: 'I'd Say It Was a 10'

In November, the Sunday Times reported on the  extreme  porn discovered on the computer in Damian Green's parliamentary office in 2008; Green was unequivocal in his response, branding the allegations  false, disreputable political smears.  An investigation was launched by the cabinet secretary, and it was determined that Green did not adhere to the  seven principles of public life —one is honesty—as required by the ministerial code. The lying doesn't relate to how the porn got there, but to Green's assertion that he was unaware it had been found during a police investigation of government leaks, reports the AP. In his resignation letter, Green allowed that  I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013.  He reiterated that he did not  download or view  the porn.

She received the bulk of a $127 million estate when her husband Vincent died, but her brother-in-law said Vincent was senile when he signed his will. Astor settled the case—and learned from it, cutting off anyone who unsuccessfully challenged her will.  It seems amazing that, half a century later, there would still be fighting over this,  said one author.",Latest Astor Battle Restages 1959 Clan Fight
"(Jul 16, 2020  2:00 AM CDT) Activists are calling attention to a tragic Pennsylvania case in which a 13-year-old boy has been charged, as an adult, with felony homicide after fatally shooting his 9-year-old brother during a game of  Cops and Robbers.  The July 8 incident started when the brothers were playing in the living room around 6am; the younger one, Jonivan Wayne Snyder, at some point lay down on the couch to watch videos on his cellphone. The older one allegedly told police, per an arrest affidavit cited by PennLive, that he fetched a gun his father kept in the room and that he knew was loaded, pointed it at his brother's head, and pulled the trigger. The teen  related he did this because the victim was not complying with his commands while playing cops and robbers. He admitted to being angry with the victim for not listening to him,  the affidavit states. An obituary for Snyder and a GoFundMe campaign raising money for his family both note he had a good relationship with his brother and sister.  We not only lost a 9 yr old precious little boy, but we could potentially (lose) his 13yr old brother,  Snyder's aunt writes on the fundraising web page.  He is still just a child also.  Activists echo that to People.  Kids who go into the adult court re-offend quicker with more violent crimes, with very, very poor life outcomes,  one says.  That poor family, where's the sense of justice there? How is this making life better or solving anything that this family is going through right now?","Boy, 13, Charged as Adult After Killing Brother During Game"
"(Jan 2, 2014  2:45 PM) Drivers in Iowa who rolled down their window to give a few bucks to a homeless guy asking for help on Christmas Eve got a surprise gift in return. The  homeless  man was actually Des Moines business owner Jonnie Wright, and he gave his donors a sealed envelope with either a $10 or $100 bill inside along with a note, reports KCCI-TV.  I am not homeless or destitute or without a job,  it read. I am here to give thanks for the many blessings in my life by paying them forward and honoring you and others who give.  In all, Wright gave away 50 envelopes for a total $1,000, then donated the money that he had received to a local homeless shelter, he wrote in a Facebook post. He tells the Huffington Post that the experience was  transformative,  especially given the national publicity it has received.  I never ever imagined that it would have the reach that it did, but it seems to have touched something in people,  he said.  I can't even explain it.","Man Poses as Homeless, Gives Away $1K"
"(Mar 29, 2011  10:42 PM CDT) Gunmen wearing military uniforms over explosives belts charged into a government building in Saddam Hussein's hometown Tuesday in an attack that left 56 people dead, including 15 hostages who were shot execution-style. The five-hour standoff in Tikrit ended only when the attackers blew themselves up. American troops who were nearby as part of an advising mission with Iraqi forces responded to the attack, and some US soldiers received minor wounds, a military spokesman says. The US troops dropped back after Iraqi forces took control. The dead included three provincial councilmen and Iraqi journalist Sabah al-Bazi, a freelancer for CNN and Reuters. Iraqi officials were quick to blame al-Qaeda in Iraq for the slaughter, noting that execution-style killings and suicide bombers are hallmarks of the extremist group. Members of Iraq's parliament immediately called for an investigation into how the band of eight or nine insurgents could pull off the attack and paralyze a mostly Sunni Muslim city that was once a hotbed for al-Qaeda in Iraq and Saddam sympathizers.",56 Killed in Iraq Hostage Siege

Heritage Auctions in Dallas said Saturday's sale involved 14 strands that were snipped by Jefferson's personal physician at the time of the statesman's death on July 4, 1826. A Heritage Auctions statement says the pre-auction estimate for the hair was $3,000. Company spokesman Eric Bradley says the buyer wished to remain anonymous. The seller was collector William F.

The bloc's GDP contracted 0.2% in the second quarter, worse than expected, according to new figures released today. Several individual European nations, including giant Germany, are already contracting, and forecasters see little sign of a turnaround soon. Europe's response to the global economic downturn has been piecemeal, with individual nations taking charge of their own affairs. But in December EU leaders will work out a collective response, possibly including a bailout of the floundering auto sector. The news also means that the European Central Bank, which has been more prudent than the Fed or the Bank of England, will probably offer a big rate cut at its next meeting.",15-Nation Eurozone Falls Into Recession

"(Jan 24, 2015  9:47 AM) Nearly 80 bottles of wine valued at least $300,000 made it clear across the country after being stolen from a posh California restaurant, but the vino is back in safe hands now. The Napa County Sheriff's Department says wine stolen from the world-renowned French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., has been recovered in Greensboro, NC, reports the Los Angeles Times. Or most of it anyway:  There a few bottles still outstanding,  says a deputy. No arrests have been made, and authorities aren't providing many details because the investigation is continuing. The AP reports that the wine turned up in a private cellar, but it had no specifics beyond that. The story quotes an industry expert who says that it's possible some of the bottles had digital tracking devices. No wonder: The bounty included Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, which can fetch $10,000 a bottle. Authorities previously declared that it looked like an inside job, though owner/chef Thomas Keller said that didn't mean much: It  could have been the linen delivery guys, the wine delivery guys, and any of the people who service the restaurant, as well as everybody who ever worked at one of our restaurants over the years.

Baker began his career busking on the London Underground before teaming up with Billy Connolly to form folk duo the Stumblebums. He later formed soft rock group Stealer's Wheel before launching a solo career. Rafferty made more than $100,000 a year in royalties from  Baker Street,  a song about his unhappiness with stardom, which, ironically, brought him even more fame, notes BBC presenter Paul Gambaccini. Rafferty  just wasn't of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it,  Gambaccini says.

"(Jun 14, 2016  5:35 PM CDT) When the staff at London's highbrow Southbank International school heard former teacher William Vahey had died of a heart attack, tears were shed. The reality was infinitely darker: Vahey took his own life with a stab wound to the chest in the bathtub of a Minnesota Quality Inn on March 21, 2014. The next month, the FBI revealed the married father of two sons was believed to be one of the most prolific pedophiles it had ever dealt with, one who was able to drug and abuse male pupils at international schools in eight countries over his 42-year career with impunity. Now, the Guardian's five-month investigation into the case reveals  evidence that, if properly explored,  could have stopped Vahey, convicted as a pedophile in the US at age 20—something all the background checks missed. At schools in places like Indonesia he would lead the travel club, taking students to far-flung locations where invariably some of the boys would fall sick—drugged by Vahey; he would insist on watching over them, in his room or theirs. A fellow chaperone recalls being likely drugged and how insistent Vahey was that no one touch his camera. A man who at age 14 had sleepovers with Vahey's sons at their Jakarta home recalls being given drug-laced Oreos and the  eating race  Vahey would suggest to get the boys to gobble them down. His parents went to an administrator who now denies being told about the cookies specifically. The Guardian suggests Vahey's wife's prominent position within the international schools community may have made some hesitant to speak up about their suspicions for fear of damage to their careers. Things only began to unravel when Vahey's maid stole his flashdrive, which held photos of naked and partially clad boys—some 90 of them—and turned it over to the American Nicaraguan School in November 2013.

"(Oct 13, 2018  9:30 AM CDT)  I was just sexually assaulted by a child.  So claimed a white woman outside a Brooklyn deli Wednesday as cell-phone cameras rolled and the accused black boy, who's about 9, burst into tears. Teresa Klein, 53, made the accusation in a 911 call, saying the child  grabbed  her and then his mother  decided to yell at me.  The scene unfolded in a Facebook video that's been seen over five million times as of this writing, the New York Post reports. But Klein didn't back down, and amid a firestorm of social-media criticism returned to Sahara Deli Market on Friday to watch security footage of the alleged groping. People jammed the store's doorway and aimed their cell cameras at Klein as footage played on a ceiling-mounted TV: It showed the boy brushing Klein's behind with his backpack as she leaned over the counter. Klein later apologized in a media interview, saying,  Young man, I don’t know your name but I’m sorry.  But she denied being racist and still grumbled about the boy's mother getting aggressive with her. Meanwhile, Twitter feeds have dubbed her #CornerstoreCaroline, a reference to other recent, dubious accusations by white people about black behavior (another accuser was called #BBQBecky).

"(Feb 2, 2014  11:56 PM) The American abortion rate has dropped to its lowest level since 1973's landmark Roe v. Wade decision—and the fall appears to have a lot more to do with contraception and the economy than with state laws restricting abortion, a new study finds. Researchers say there were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2011, down a full 13% from 2008 and only slightly higher than the rate after abortion was legalized in all 50 states 40 years ago, the Washington Post reports. The abortion rate has been in long-term decline from a peak of almost 30 per 1,000 women in 1981, though the fall stalled in the middle of the last decade, notes the New York Times. The study's lead author says the decline is probably linked to the overall decline in pregnancy rates that happened during the recession, along with the growing use of near-foolproof long-term contraceptives like intrauterine devices. Anti-abortion activists, however, say the drop shows their lobbying efforts are working. The decline  shows that women are rejecting the idea of abortion as the answer to an unexpected pregnancy,  the president of the National Right to Life Committee tells the AP.",Abortion Rate Hasn't Been This Low Since 1973

A sharecropper's son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a House committee that investigated President Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of the president's governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House, the AP reports.

The Library of Congress conducted the first comprehensive survey of silent films over the past two years and found that 70% are believed to be lost.

About 11% of the films that survive exist only as foreign versions or on lower-quality formats. Notable films now considered lost include Cleopatra from 1917, the Great Gatsby from 1926, Lon Chaney's London After Midnight from 1927, and The Patriot from 1928. Films featuring early stars, including Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Mary Pickford still exist.

A photo of the iceberg that doomed the Titanic was also sold, for just over $32,000.  It is incredible that this biscuit has survived such a dramatic event—the sinking of the world's largest ocean liner—costing 1,500 lives,  auctioneer Andrew Aldridge of Henry Aldridge & Son tells the Salisbury Journal. The cracker had been salvaged by one James Fenwick, a passenger on the RMS Carpathia, the boat that went to the aid of Titanic passengers that night, per the Journal. Fenwick kept the cracker in a Kodak photo envelope with a note that read:  Pilot biscuit from Titanic lifeboat April 1912.  Other expensive crackers Aldridge is aware of include one from one of Ernest Shackleton's adventures (that one went for about $4,500, Aldridge notes) and one from the Lusitania, now safe in an Irish museum and said to be valued at between $12,000 and $15,000—making Aldridge confident that he could proclaim the Titanic cracker  the most valuable biscuit in the world.

But I thought the corporate tax rate needed to be lowered, and I'm not sure you can lower it from nothing.  Then he discovered that GE actually got a $3.2 billion tax benefit:  I stand corrected. That is a corporate tax rate of negative 60%.  Even so, GE cut one-fifth of its US jobs in the last nine years, while creating more overseas jobs.  You know, I know the Supreme Court ruled that corporations are people, but what I didn't realize is that those people are assholes,  Stewart noted. Luckily, President Obama is here,  hopin' ass and takin' change.  Or not: Obama has actually praised GE, and given its CEO Jeff Immelt a leadership position.  Yeah, you ripped Immelt a new—wait, chairmanship?  Stewart cried.  I give up!",Jon Stewart on GE: No Federal Income Tax Despite $14.2B in Profits? 'I Give Up' (Daily Show Video)

"(Dec 27, 2017  7:41 AM) They were driving to meet up with each other on Christmas Eve, but first, a husband and wife made two separate pit stops to help save a few lives. In a Good Samaritan play in two acts, KFOR reports that Crystal Travis kicked things off Sunday in Cleveland County, NC, when she saw flames coming out of a home. Travis, who was on her way home after visiting a relative with her 14-year-old daughter, says they pulled over and helped a family with a baby escape, as well as drag Christmas gifts away from the burning residence, CNN reports.  It was just all really fast, really chaotic,  she tells WSOC, noting there was  smoke everywhere  and that a propane tank on the porch exploded at one point. After first responders arrived, Travis' daughter called husband and dad Roger Travis, and they decided to meet at a nearby restaurant. Then Roger Travis found himself in the same role as his wife and daughter: that of serendipitous stranger. He says he was driving past a local mall when he saw a car on the median, and when he pulled over, he saw a baby on the ground who wasn't breathing, per CNN. Roger Travis, an ex-volunteer firefighter and first responder, says he and a firefighter on the scene administered CPR until the baby started making noises and once more drawing breaths. The Travises are calling their joint rescues a  Christmas miracle,  per WSOC.  What are the odds? This is the craziest day ever,  Crystal Travis says.

"(May 18, 2011  8:51 AM CDT) When it comes to the 2012 presidential election, Republicans are  depressed,  says one integral GOP member. Lobbyists tell Politico that instead of asking,  Who do you like?  they ask each other,  Who do we back?  Top Republicans, in fact, believe President Obama will be reelected if no stronger candidates emerge, leading some to plead with Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels to enter the race. (Notes Mike Allen on Politico:  It’s a sign of the GOP’s straits that the party is depending on the bland, wonkish Daniels for an adrenaline boost.  Republicans are concerned Mitt Romney will have too many problems debating Obama on health reform, Tim Pawlenty isn’t exciting enough, Jon Huntsman is too moderate, and Newt Gingrich is too polarizing. Meanwhile, desirable possibilities like Jeb Bush and Paul Ryan likely will not run this time around. But if Daniels should enter, as many party elites are begging him to do, it will be easy for him to get his campaign together.

"(Mar 17, 2016  11:28 AM CDT) Ken Williams, executive VP of the Chicago White Sox, says he doesn't have a problem with players' kids hanging out in the clubhouse, per the Chicago Sun-Times. But Drake LaRoche, the 14-year-old son and constant companion of first baseman Adam LaRoche, was there just a little too much for his liking— he had a locker,  Williams notes—so he asked the elder LaRoche to cut back on father-son time on White Sox premises. Instead, LaRoche abruptly announced Tuesday he'd be retiring and leaving his $13 million salary behind, the AP reports. LaRoche tweeted later that afternoon,  Thank u Lord for the game of baseball and for giving me way more than I ever deserved!  accompanied by a #FamilyFirst hashtag. But Williams tells Fox Sports' Ken Rosenthal that the team's policy on bringing kids to the clubhouse hasn't changed, that  everyone loves  Drake, and that  in no way do I want this to be about [Drake].  Instead, Williams notes, he simply wanted LaRoche to  dial it back.   I don't think [Drake] should be here 100% of the time,  he tells Rosenthal, adding to the AP,  Even 50% is probably too much, but there is a wide range between zero and 50%.  But some feel that Drake, called the team's  26th man  by his dad last year, has been more blessing than burden.  Drake would clean cleats ... help out in drills ... he didn't say boo to anybody and was never a trouble in the clubhouse,  White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton tells Fox. In a follow-up, Rosenthal says some players see Williams' point (e.g., players might not want a kid around if they've had a bad day or may feel compelled to censor themselves), but he wonders if Williams would have issued the mandate if LaRoche had had a better 2015 season. Meanwhile, player support for LaRoche continues, per Sports Illustrated, with Brewers pitcher Blaine Boyer telling Rosenthal,  I honestly think this is between good and evil.

The Oklahoma Department of Corrections describes the Saturday afternoon incident at the Cimarron Correctional Facility as a  disturbance  and says staff members in the area responded very quickly, NBC News reports. Officials say the incident, which happened as medium-security inmates were being let out to the exercise yard, left three men dead from stab wounds on Saturday and a fourth man died from his wounds overnight, reports the AP, which notes that up to 300 inmates were involved in a massive brawl at the same facility in June. It's not clear what sparked the violence at the prison operated by Corrections Corporation of America, which the Wall Street Journal notes is America's largest private prison operator. The 1,720-bed facility was locked down after the incident, and officials say that as a precaution, all other prisons in the state are also on lockdown, the AP reports. The AP also notes that with a homicide rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates, compared to an average of 4 per 100,000 nationwide, Oklahoma has the highest prison murder rate in the country.",4 Killed in 'Disturbance' at Private Prison

But some troubling new statistics show that a lot of ground has been lost in the fight against STDs, and it's affecting some of the most vulnerable members of society. According to a new CDC report, 918 babies were born with syphilis in the US in 2017, the Guardian reports. That's a 20-year high. For context, there were 628 cases of syphilis in infants in 2016. In 2013, there were 362. Of the 2017 cases, 77 resulted in stillbirths or newborn deaths, per USA Today. Western and southern states had the most cases of congenital syphilis in 2017, per the report, with Louisiana having the highest rate.  It's just a systematic public health failure. It's shocking that this has come roaring back in the United States,  David Harvey of the National Coalition of STD Directors tells the Guardian. Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics, and women can be treated while they are pregnant to prevent the disease from being passed on to their child. But, per the Guardian, some women do not get tested, and others contract the disease while pregnant after testing negative. In some cases, there is a connection to drug use. Overall, there were 30,644 syphilis diagnoses in the US in 2017—up 76% from the year before.",Cases of Syphilis in Infants Are at 20-Year High

"(Jan 10, 2012  10:51 AM) The AP turned some heads yesterday when it reported that Tim Cook might have been the highest paid CEO in America in 2011, with total pay worth some $378 million. But the key word in that sentence is  might,  notes Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune. It's still not chump change, but all Apple actually gave Cook last year was a $900,017 salary and a $14,700 contribution to his 401(K). The hundreds of millions more come from restricted stock units he was given upon promotion. Half of those shares don't vest until 2016, and the other half don't until 2021, so if Cook flames out at Apple, his 2011 payday could look pretty modest indeed. But the SEC requires companies to report share grants as compensation in the year they're given, so lots of reporters are referring to $378 million as Cook's  total compensation.  But if Cook really makes that much,  you could argue that he was worth it,  Elmer-DeWitt writes.",2011's Top-Paid CEO: Apple's Tim Cook*

The Guardian reports that the then-4-year-old, who lived with her elderly grandparents in a remote wooded area in Russia's Tuva Republic, found her 60-year-old grandmother not responding last month. Her grandfather, who's blind, couldn't venture out for help, and so Saglana grabbed a box of matches and headed out into the minus-29-degree weather to try to get to the nearest neighbor's house about 5 miles away. The Siberian Times notes Saglana had gone on walks with her grandmother in the past and recalled that even though there was no road, if she followed the river, she'd eventually hit the neighbor's house. She waded through snow that was sometimes chest-deep, luckily avoiding any resident wolves.  She could have easily stumbled on a pack in the darkness,  the local rescue group's head tells the Guardian. One of the neighbors at her destination spotted Saglana as she walked past (she apparently couldn't see the house through the weeds) and phoned for help. Sadly, when medical staff rushed to Saglana's home, it was discovered her grandmother had died of a heart attack—and in more bad news, Tuva officials have opened a criminal probe into her mom for leaving Saglana with her elderly grandparents, who may have not been able to properly care for her.

Apparently $100 million—or more than $6,400 per hour—If that estate belongs to Leona Helmsley, the Wall Street Journal reports.  By any definition, this hourly rate is exorbitant, unreasonable, and improper,  states a filing from the New York Attorney General's Office. The executors of Helmsley's will—two grandchildren, a lawyer, and a business advisor—defended their request for the  astronomical  fee stating they  faced enormous risks  while increasing the estate's value. Helmsley—a famous New York City property owner who KCCI points out was known as the  Queen of Mean —was worth $4.78 billion when she died in 2007, the Journal reports.

Well, keep wondering, but an excerpt from an unreleased Japanese documentary has Kubrick explaining the film's mysterious ending, BoingBoing reports.  I've tried to avoid doing this ever since the picture came out. When you just say the ideas they sound foolish, whereas if they’re dramatized one feels it, but I'll try,  the famed director of Dr. Strangelove and The Shining tells TV personality Jun'ichi Yaio in a phone call.  The idea was supposed to be that [the astronaut played by actor Keir Dullea] is taken in by god-like entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time.  After discussing the  deliberately  inaccurate French architecture of the room in the closing scene, Kubrick says that  when they get finished with him, as happens in so many myths of all cultures in the world, he is transformed into some kind of super being and sent back to Earth, transformed and made into some sort of superman. We have to only guess what happens when he goes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest.

The transplanted Southerner, rated as one of the best baseball broadcasters of all time, became known as the voice of Detroit during his decades of doing play-by-play for the Tigers, the Detroit Free Press notes in a glowing tribute. Harwell started out as a sportswriter aged 16 in 1934 and moved to sportscasting with the Atlanta Crackers. After a stint in the Marines during World War II, he ended up in the big leagues when the Brooklyn Dodgers acquired him from the Crackers for catcher Cliff Dapper. He moved to Detroit in 1960 and was still broadcasting the full 162-game schedule into his eighties. After learning he had just months to live, Harwell said death was just the next big adventure.  I’ve had so many great ones,  he said.  It’s been a terrific life.",Beloved MLB Broadcaster Ernie Harwell Dead at 92
"(Apr 12, 2010  11:13 AM CDT) Being the daughter of a supermodel can't be easy—but how about being the 330-pound daughter of a supermodel? Zulekha Haywood, whose mother is Iman (and father is NBA legend Spencer Haywood), recounts her obesity battle in a lengthy piece in Glamour. The now 165-pound 31-year-old, who has  more or less been on a diet since I was eight,  writes that  my mother would whisper basta ( enough  in Italian) when I was in danger of overeating. I usually put down the fork. But I also got hip to late-night snacking. In the end, all I learned from basta was how to make PB&J in the dark.  Zulekha tried to live  joyfully and without apology,  and  largely succeeded.  But she still tried everything from diet pills to the Master Cleanse, and with a  soul-crushing  BMI of 46, she opted for gastric bypass. A year later she was a size 6.  Now when I walk into a room, guys really pay attention. But the sad fact is that volume hasn’t improved the quality. Perhaps it’s just this kind of attention that has given me a deeper appreciation for my mother’s beauty. What people respond to is her grace and elegance, her independent thinking and charity for others.

Jerry Brown has pardoned five refugees from Cambodia and another immigrant from Honduras who faced the possibility of deportation because of their criminal convictions, the AP reports. The pardons were among more than 250 clemency decisions announced by the governor on Christmas Eve. According to Brown's office, the five Cambodians entered the country when they were 5 or younger. The pardons don't automatically stop deportation proceedings, but they eliminate the state convictions on which federal authorities might base deportation decisions. That gives the men's lawyers strong legal arguments before immigration judges to try to prevent their removal from the country.","For Over 250 Prisoners, It Really Is Christmas"
"(Aug 16, 2017  7:23 PM CDT) Police are begging for information from the public regarding the horrific murder of a 12-year-old girl in her family's mobile home last week in Tennessee. Fox 17 reports Yhoana Arteaga was on crutches and stuck at home in Goodlettsville last Thursday, having injured her leg in a skating accident the day before. According to WKRN, Yhoana's mother says her daughter texted her around 5:30pm to let her know someone was knocking on the door. She says she returned home from work a little over an hour later to find her daughter dead. Police, who are keeping some details private, say Yhoana died from blunt force trauma and her clothing  was in disarray,  the Tennessean reports.  This is a horrible, brutal thing,  Sgt. David Kautzman says.  I’ve never seen anything this brutal in my entire career.  So far, police have received fewer tips than is typical with this type of crime, and police have few leads.  We believe there are persons in this community who have knowledge of a person who may be responsible for this,  police spokesperson Don Aaron says.  Please, for the family’s sake, for the sake of this 12-year-old deceased girl, let us know.  Police say they believe Yhoana knew her killer, and they do have a number of persons of interest—though they are not identifying them. The family's home remains an active crime scene, and police are continuing to investigate.

"(Mar 12, 2013  10:43 AM CDT) America's schools are in such disrepair that it would cost more than $270 billion just to get elementary and secondary school buildings back to their original conditions—and twice that to get them up to date, a report released today estimates. In a foreword to the report, Bill Clinton said that  we are still struggling to provide equal opportunity  to children and urged the first federal study of school buildings in almost two decades. The Center for Green Schools' researchers reviewed spending and estimates that schools spent $211 billion on upkeep between 1995 and 2008. During that time, schools should have spent some $482 billion, the group calculated. That left a $271 billion gap between what should have been spent on upkeep and what was—or $5,450 per student, the group reported. To update the buildings, the figure doubles, to $542 billion over the next decade.  When we talk about a quality education, we talk about the 'who' and the 'what'— teachers and curriculum—but we don't talk about the 'where.'

"(Oct 21, 2010  11:29 AM CDT) The government spelled out today just how much the most expensive rescue of the financial crisis will end up costing taxpayers—as much as $259 billion for mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By contrast, the combined bailouts of financial companies and the auto industry have cost taxpayers roughly $50 billion, and the bailouts of Wall Street banks alone, which sparked public fury, have so far brought taxpayers a $16 billion return. Fannie and Freddie could end up costing taxpayers between $142 billion and $259 billion through 2013, the Federal Housing Finance Agency projected today. Those figures take into account dividends that the agency estimates the two companies will end up paying the government: between $80 billion and $104 billion over the next three years.

Russell Taylor was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty to child exploitation and child porn charges. The 44-year-old Indianapolis man agreed in September to plead guilty and admitted using hidden cameras to produce pornography of 12 children. Taylor was executive director of a nonprofit Fogle started to fight childhood obesity. Prosecutors say Fogle received photos or videos from Taylor of eight of Taylor's 12 child victims. Fogle was sentenced last month to more than 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to trading in child pornography and paying for sex with underage girls.

Samson, 50, gave her address as 4205 North Creal St., instead of 4025. The incorrect address didn't come up in police systems, and Samson's phone didn't have  smart 911  that enabled authorities to track it. The 1:20am call got disconnected, and Samson managed to call back three times. She repeated the 4205 address, and her last call was interrupted by screams and gunshots. When police got to North Creal Street and figured out the correct address, about 15 minutes after the initial call, they found her shot to death and her husband, George Samson, dead in the basement of a self-inflicted gunshot. The couple had been married the previous night, and guests reported that an argument between them at the reception continued at a get-together at their house afterward.

The next morning, on Nov. 1, 1980, a passing trucker spotted her body on the side of the highway, reports ABC13. Likely aged 15 to 20, the girl was naked and had been strangled. Not only could police not find her killer, but no one at Ellis Prison Farm could identify the girl—who was white, five and a half feet tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes—and an investigation that followed offered no clues about who she might be. Now, Sheriff Clint McRae and the Walker County Sheriff's Office hope that sharing the few facts they have will lead to new information. Authorities say the girl—last seen wearing jeans, a yellow shirt, a white knit sweater, a rectangular brown stone pendant on a gold chain, and leather sandals—first visited a gas station on the city's south side, where workers gave her directions to Ellis Prison Farm. She left on foot, eventually arriving at a truck stop on I-45 on the north side of Huntsville. There, she again asked for directions, which employees wrote down.

"(Aug 12, 2014  1:03 PM CDT) The first study of its kind shows that newborns' brains grow fast—figure a staggering 1% a day immediately after birth, though it slows to about half that rate by the end of three months. Using MRI scans of 87 newborns' brains, researchers discovered that the first weeks of life see the fastest growth—those little brains grow by 64% in three months. The cerebellum, responsible for movement, grows the fastest and the memory-forming hippocampus the slowest, LiveScience reports. Researchers from UC San Diego and the University of Hawaii took more than 200 MRI scans of full-term and preemie babies, starting when the kids were just 2 days old. The scans found that preemies' brains are 2% smaller than average at the end of 90 days, suggesting that medically unnecessary induced labor can stunt a baby’s brain development, says UC San Diego's Dominic Holland.  The brains of premature babies actually grow faster than those of term-born babies, but that's because they're effectively younger—and younger means faster growth,  he adds. Researchers say using MRI or CT scans will prove to be a much more effective way to track development. Scans should lead to more exact growth charts—replacing the old method of measuring the skull with measuring tape—and help identify disorders such as autism or brain injury early. Researchers plan to look further into how alcohol and drug use during pregnancy affects brain development.

Arlene Magdanz, a San Francisco-area substitute teacher, is now officially a millionaire seven times over thanks to a dead first cousin. The AP reports that a crew cleaning out Walter Samaszko Jr.'s home found ammunition boxes in the 69-year-old's garage filled with thousands of gold coins, worth $7.4 million. The haul was so huge that the public administrator of the estate borrowed a neighbor's wheelbarrow to cart the treasure out—and filled the wheelbarrow twice. Officials tracked down Magdanz using a funeral bulletin at Samaszko's home that led to his father's service in Chicago in the early 1960s, and then newspaper clippings that listed survivors. It's unclear what Samaszko did for a living, or where the money used to buy the gold came from; his mother, who lived with him until her death in 1992, may have actually been the one to purchase it. The public administrator described the coins as  nothing spectacular —the value comes from the fact that there are more than 8,000 of them.

The Local reports that authorities have scoured the area, using helicopters, police dogs, divers, and cavers around France’s southeastern Isère region to track down any trace of Maelys De Araujo. After canines lost the girl’s scent in the venue’s parking lot, police believe kidnapping is a possibility, though they are not ruling out other explanations,  accidental or criminal,  for her disappearance.  Given the time that has elapsed since the disappearance of the young Maelys and given the resources that have sadly been deployed in vain to find her, the criminal possibility can no longer be ruled out,  local prosecutor Dietlind Baudoin said during a news conference.

The DJ for the evening announced on the microphone that a child had disappeared,  a wedding guest told Le Parisien.  Suddenly, everyone started searching, in the main hall and outside.  He added,  We initially thought she must be asleep in a corner after a game of hide-and-seek.  Police were contacted an hour later when the search yielded no results, the Guardian reports. All of the 180 wedding guests were interviewed by police, who are now reviewing photos and videos from the celebration and conducting 70 additional interviews of people who attended outside social events at a local bar and community hall around the same time.","Search Underway After French Girl, 9, Vanishes at Wedding"
"(May 10, 2017  12:03 AM CDT) For weeks Seattle Mayor Ed Murray pushed ahead with plans for his re-election campaign despite claims by men he sexually abused them decades ago when they were teenagers, allegations Murray vehemently denied. But Murray announced Tuesday he was abandoning his bid for a second term, saying it would be best for the city, the AP reports.  It tears me to pieces to step away, but I believe it's in the best interest of this city that I love,  said Murray, 62, flanked by his husband and tearful supporters. He said he'll serve out his term through the end of this year. The mayor, a Democrat, said he was proud of his accomplishments, including raising Seattle's minimum wage to $15. Murray reiterated his denial of the allegations that first emerged last month when a man filed a lawsuit claiming Murray paid him for sex in the 1980s. Three other men also came forward with similar allegations, including one who is jailed on drug charges.  The allegations against me are not true,  Murray said.  And I say this with all honesty and with the deepest sincerity. But the scandal surrounding them and me is hurting this city.  Murray, who became a frequent, high-profile critic of President Trump after last year's election, has previously claimed the allegations were part of an anti-gay conservative campaign to oust him, but he didn't repeat those accusations during his speech.","After Abuse Claims, Seattle Mayor Won't Seek 2nd Term"

"(Feb 3, 2018  2:21 PM) As far as Debra Suierveld is concerned, Abby pulled a Lazarus.  We thought she had passed away,  Suierveld tells KDKA.  It feels like a part of my kids’ childhood is back, part of our family is back.  Abby, a black lab mix, wandered off from Suierveld's home in Pennsylvania 10 years ago, and the family searched for their missing pup to no avail, the Valley News Dispatch reports. But last weekend Abby showed back up like nothing had happened. Suierveld says Abby still answers to her name and even remembers the commands she and her daughter taught her. Suierveld says her now-22-year-old daughter cried when she heard Abby had, improbably, returned home. Judy Spiering called Animal Protectors of Allegheny Valley on Jan. 27 when a friendly but very thirsty black lab mix turned up on her porch 10 miles from the Suierveld home in Apollo. A microchip in Abby's neck led to Suierveld's vet, who had Abby listed as deceased, and then to Suierveld. Suierveld couldn't believe it.  I didn't even know what to say,  she says, adding,  She kind of came back from the dead.  But no one can figure out where Abby has spent the past decade.  She's a good weight. She's very well taken care of,  says Jody Berisko at Animal Protectors.  It's very weird.  Whoever Abby was with, Suierveld admits  they took good care of her.

"(Jun 15, 2018  4:20 AM CDT) In 2014, an extremely promising young clarinetist in Canada beat dozens of other applicants to become one of two people awarded a full scholarship to complete a degree at Colburn Conservatory of Music in Los Angeles under highly esteemed teacher Yehuda Gilad. But Eric Abramovitz never saw the acceptance email because then-girlfriend Jennifer Lee, a fellow music student, was spying on his account and saw it first, a court heard this week. According to Abramovitz's lawsuit, Lee, fearing she would lose him if he moved away from Montreal, posed as Abramovitz to send an email declining the offer, the Montreal Gazette reports. After deleting the original email, she then allegedly set up a fake email account in Gilad's name and sent a rejection notice to Abramovitz, who was sharing her apartment at the time. Abramovitz—who finished his degree in Montreal but split up with Lee later in 2014 for unrelated reasons—ended up studying part-time under Gilad two years later and discovered the deception after the world-renowned teacher asked why he had rejected him. The student realized Lee was to blame when he correctly guessed the password to the account that had sent him the fake rejection notice. A judge in Ontario, calling Lee's conduct  despicable,  awarded Abramovitz $266,000, CTV reports. The judge said the figure included damages for  the incompensable personal loss suffered by Mr. Abramovitz by having a closely held personal dream snatched from him by a person he trusted.  Abramovitz's career survived the setback: He joined the Nashville Symphony Orchestra and was recently appointed to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.",Woman Ordered to Pay $266K for Derailing Boyfriend's Music Career
"(Aug 17, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) Actor Peter Fonda, the son of a Hollywood legend who became a movie star in his own right after both writing and starring in the counter-culture classic  Easy Rider,  has died. His family said in a statement that Fonda died Friday morning at his home in Los Angeles, per the AP. He was 79. The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer.  I am very sad,  Jane Fonda said in a statement.  He was my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing.  Born into Hollywood royalty as Henry Fonda's only son, Peter Fonda carved his own path with his non-conformist tendencies and earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the psychedelic road-trip movie Easy Rider. He never won that golden statuette, but he was later nominated for his turn as a Vietnam veteran and widowed beekeeper in  Ulee's Gold.  Fonda was born in New York in 1940 to Henry Fonda and Frances Ford Seymour, a Canadian-born US socialite, who killed herself when Peter Fonda was just 10. Fonda produced Easy Rider and Dennis Hopper directed it for a meager $380,000. It went on to gross $40 million worldwide, a substantial sum for its time. He remained prolific for the rest of his life, with notable performances as the heel in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey, from 1999, and in James Mangold's 2007 update of 3:10 to Yuma. Although Fonda never achieved the status of his father or his older sister, the impact of Easy Rider was enough to cement his place in popular culture. Fonda had an estranged relationship with his father for most of his life, but he said that they grew closer over the years before Henry Fonda died in 1982. Fonda is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, as well as his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda, and his son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer.",Peter Fonda Dead at 79

"(Dec 15, 2014  8:08 AM) A 4-year-old boy went on a couple of roller-coaster rides during a family vacation over the summer and left the amusement park with a torn carotid artery. Doctors report in the journal Pediatric Neurology that the jerkiness and gravitational forces of the ride appear to be the culprit, and that the tear resulted in a blood clot that traveled to the boy's brain, causing a stroke. The boy began vomiting the next day, then developed a droop on the left side of his face on the flight home and soon couldn't walk, reports Eureka Alerts. The doctors say that while several cases of stroke resulting from roller-coaster rides have been documented in adults, this is the youngest known case—in fact, they've identified only two other pediatric cases in medical literature, a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old. Researchers note that children under 10 possess weak neck muscles and relatively large heads, a  hypermobility  that makes them more vulnerable to such tears,  albeit rarely.  Six months after this event, which doctors treated with low-dose aspirin, the boy still has weakness on his left side but is able to move his arm, grip objects, talk normally, perform above average in school, and even take karate lessons, which is part of his therapy, reports CBS News.

Winslet learned to free dive for the Avatar 2 role and describes the scene in question:  That’s a big ceremonial sequence with those huge heavy wings. That was quite scary.

We never forgot the fact that you and your parents are the ones who saved our lives. The only reason we are alive is because of you and your family,  Leon Gersten, 79, told Czeslaw Polziec, 81, both of them fighting against tears of their own. The first words Polziec said upon seeing Gersten at the airport were some of the few English words he knows, the New York Daily News reports:  Hi! Hi! Hi! I am very glad to see you.

"(Mar 28, 2017  6:15 PM CDT) It turns out the robot uprising was a whole lot less The Terminator and a whole lot more Roger & Me. A study from economists at MIT and Boston University published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research attempts to quantify the effects of industrial automation on American employment. It found that between 1990 and 2007, each robot added to the workforce reduced employment in the local commuting area by three to six jobs, Quartz reports. The addition of one robot per thousand workers also lowered wages by 0.25% to 0.5%. Overall, the report estimates robots cost the US between 360,000 and 670,000 jobs total during the span in question, according to the Verge. But robots don't affect all jobs equally. Unsurprisingly, robots had the biggest impact on the wages of America's lowest earners—blue collar workers and those without a college education—and could be responsible for growing the wage gap, Bloomberg reports. The automotive industry has taken the brunt of the robot uprising, with 39% of the US' industrial robots working in that industry. Some experts expect the number of robots working in the US to more than double by 2025 to more than 3 million. And it remains to be seen whether the market will find new jobs for humans, as it has after the advent of new technologies in the past, or whether robots will continue to depress employment and wages into the future.

"(Feb 27, 2020  5:16 AM) A Texas teacher who was forced out of the job she loved for showing students a photo of the woman she was going to marry has settled with the school district for $100,000. Stacy Bailey was suspended from her position as an art teacher at Arlington's Charlotte Anderson Elementary School in 2017 after introducing herself to fourth-grade students with photos of family members and her fiancee, causing a parent to complain that she was promoting  the homosexual agenda.  The district agreed to a settlement after a judge ruled the suspension violated her 14th Amendment right to equal protection, NBC reports. Bailey—who married Julie Vasquez two years ago—was transferred to a high school four months after she filed a lawsuit in April 2018. Before the suspension, Bailey had worked at the school for 10 years and was named Teacher of the Year twice. As part of the settlement, the Mansfield Independent School District has agreed to wipe the suspension from the record and train staff members on LGBTQ issues.  If a district is thinking about bullying or shaming a gay teacher out of their job, I hope they remember my name,  Bailey tells the New York Times.  And I hope they think twice.  She is donating $10,000 from the settlement to a group that supports gay students. Texas does not have a law banning workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, but  the judge's ruling is clear: that gay teachers are protected by the constitution,  her lawyer says.",Teacher Who Showed Photo of Future Wife Gets $100K Settlement
"(Jun 3, 2010  2:15 PM CDT) A jury has awarded a Texas man $1.5 million in his lawsuit over a series of racist and profane voicemails allegedly left by insistent debt collectors. The man, 26-year-old Allen Jones, says employees of Advanced Call Center Technologies harassed him with ever more aggressive calls, using racially charged language.  Go pick some motherf---ing cotton fields!  a caller suggested in one tape provided by Jones' lawyers. Jones says he had already paid off the $81 credit card debt the collectors were calling about, but they continued to call, sometimes as early as 6:30am or as late as 11pm.

"(Feb 15, 2013  6:59 AM) Farming and logging are destroying the habitats of the world's reptiles, putting nearly one in five in danger of extinction, reports AFP. The new study—in which 200 experts examined 1,500 species of snakes, turtles, lizards, crocodiles, and other reptiles—claims to be the most comprehensive made of the world's reptile populations. Of those reptiles at risk, more than 10% are critically endangered, 41% are endangered, and the rest are considered vulnerable. Freshwater reptiles are particularly at risk, with one-third estimated to be close to extinction, especially freshwater turtles.  The findings sound alarm bells about the state of these species and the growing threats that they face,  said one conservationist. One of the study's authors noted that many people wrongly assume reptiles to be resilient animals; in truth,  many species are very highly specialized in terms of habitat use and the climate conditions they require for day-to-day functioning. This makes them particularly sensitive to environmental changes.",20% of Reptiles at Risk of Extinction

"(Nov 25, 2014  4:00 PM) Florida police say they have uncovered an online prostitution ring that was allegedly run by a 17-year-old girl. Alexa Nicole De Armas was arrested on Friday after police caught wind of the ring; four female students at Sarasota County's Venice High reportedly told their teachers that Alexa and a male student had pushed them to join the ring. Per police documents, Alexa and a second student came up with what the Herald-Tribune terms a  business plan  before the school year began. Their alleged intention was to pimp out fellow teens in exchange for money and alcohol. Deals were arranged via Facebook messages, and WWSB reports the girls said Alexa used Facebook to facilitate things because she doesn't have a cell phone. Students say three deals were made, and police say at least one sex act did take place: John Michael Mosher, 21, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old against her will after forking over $40 and a bottle of liquor; he has been arrested. Police got a search warrant for Alexa's Facebook account, and say they found communications regarding participants, how to split the money, and pricing, which apparently topped out at $100. The Herald-Tribune prints one such exchange to a  business partner,  which reads:  Why pimp out old hoes when I have fresh young hoes I can give up for money?

"(Jun 3, 2011  3:20 PM CDT) One of Hollywood's greatest sheriffs, James Arness, died today of natural causes at his home, the Los Angeles Times reports. At 6-foot-7, Arness dominated TV screens as Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke, which ran from 1955 to 1975 and defined the TV Western. Arness had been wary about taking a TV role because he was afraid of losing his chance to be in movies. It was John Wayne who pushed Arness to become Marshal Dillon and who introduced him to the show's viewers: I knew there was only one man to play in it,  said Wayne.  I've worked with him, and I predict he'll be a big star.  Arness was born in Minneapolis in 1923, three years prior to his brother actor, the late Peter Graves. He got drafted by the Army and served in World War II but was honorably discharged after an encounter with a German machine gun nest left him seriously injured, with one leg a little shorter than the other. Back in the US, he eventually studied acting under the GI bill. He is survived by his second wife, Janet, and two sons.",Gunsmoke's 'Marshal Dillon' Dead at 88
"(Sep 16, 2015  7:00 PM CDT) Officials expect General Motors will be fined hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement over faulty ignition switches that resulted in 124 deaths and 273 injuries, NBC News reports. A settlement between GM and the Justice Department could come as early as tomorrow, though the Wall Street Journal—citing  people familiar with the matter —warns any deal could still fall apart. Last year, the government accused GM of taking too long to disclose the ignition switch problem in violation of federal law, NBC reports. The government alleges GM knew about defect—which could shut off the car's engine without warning, disabling airbags and power steering and brakes—for more than a decade before finally reporting it. The Journal reports the settlement will likely come with a charge of criminal wire fraud against GM for making misleading statements and hiding information about the problem. For example, a government report found GM avoided using the word  stall  when discussing the issue to avoid people thinking it was a safety problem. According to sources cited by the Journal and NBC, GM will be fined somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion. The amount is expected to be less than the $1.2 billion Toyota was fined in a similar case last year because GM cooperated with the government investigation, the Journal reports. According to NBC, GM has already paid out at least $1 million to each victim or victim's family.",GM Facing up to $1B Fine Over Faulty Ignition Switches

The men, who were granted $7.5 million each, were among hundreds of mentally disabled Henry's Turkey Service workers sent from Texas to a labor camp in Iowa, the Des Moines Register reports. They earned 41 cents an hour working in a meat-processing plant and lived in a 100-year-old former school building where they  were treated like cattle—like company property,  says a witness for the prosecution. The decades-long operation ended after the Register began investigating living conditions in 2009. The company didn't have a license for disabled care, and men didn't receive disability services or health insurance.  If the eyes of Iowa saw what was happening ... the party was going to be over,  a lawyer said. The bunkhouse supervisor was accused of handcuffing one man to a bed; reports also suggested men were beaten after breaking rules.

CNN reports the 24-year-old got hit with just over 11 years behind bars for  manufacturing, possessing, and detonating a chemical weapon  in the Kisatchie National Forest next to Louisiana's Fort Polk. The bomb, which contained chlorine gas, seriously injured two US Army soldiers who rushed over to see what had happened after they heard the bomb detonate.

A total of 11 stores in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Arizona will close temporarily. The specific locations can be found here via 9to5mac.

The closings will start Saturday, giving customers who dropped their devices off to be repaired a chance to retrieve them. All 11 stores were shut in March, then reopened with masks and temperature checks required, per CNBC. An executive had warned at the time, per TechCrunch, that reopening a store  in no way means that we won’t take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant.  Apple was among the first chain retailers to shut stores when the pandemic hit. Although the lost sales at the 11 stores won't have much impact on Apple, per the Wall Street Journal, one market analyst called the closings worrisome. The move reflects  the volatility and fluidity of this COVID environment,  he said, and indicate that coronavirus flareups could continue to affect retailers' decisions.","11 Stores Reopened, Now Will Shut Again"

The nation is now grappling with the staggering logistics of getting rid of acres of tires, plastic, twisted metal, wood, etc. The work is expected to cost $8.4 billion and take at least three years.

If you're not sure what kind of cloud you're seeing above your head, consult the World Meteorological Organization's International Cloud Atlas, newly updated just in time for World Meteorological Day on Thursday. The Weather Channel reports that a bunch of new classifications have been added to the atlas (the first fully web-based version) for the first time in three decades, including the volutus  roll cloud  and aforementioned asperitas, as well as human-created cloud types like contrails (the condensation trails left in the wake of airplanes). There's even a new  accessory  cloud known as the flumen (aka  beaver's tail ), which sometimes follows along with a convective storm, a WMO press release notes. The science behind the atlas's cloud classifications, which Live Science calls  not for the faint of heart,  is a sophisticated one. The 10 cornerstone clouds, referred to as  genera,  are the ones you've likely heard of—stratus and cumulus, among others. Then the classification gets more granular with  species,  which break down the genera clouds further based on shapes, and from there to  varieties,  which indicate transparency and arrangement. The recent additions fall under the species category; there's also a new  supplementary features  section of  unusual parts —such as the aforementioned asperitas, a wavy look to a cloud's underside—and five  special  clouds, including the contrail and clouds formed by waterfall mist.

"(Jul 14, 2014  11:29 AM CDT) In 2011, Leroy  Buddy  Bronson's wife and 11-year-old daughter were killed by a drunk driver. Last year, Bronson himself was killed by a different drunk driver. And on Friday, that second driver—25-year-old Ronald O'Kelly—received a suspended sentence that could see him spend just 120 days in jail, the Kansas City Star reports. Bronson, 57, was riding his motorcycle in Kansas City just after midnight on April 7, 2013, when O'Kelly, who ultimately pleaded guilty, hit him with his Ford F-150 after failing to stop at a red light. O'Kelly then fled the scene.  It’s unthinkable,  says Bronson's stepson of the sentence.  It teaches other drunk drivers that if they get in a wreck—fatality or nonfatality—to just run and you will get a light sentence.  The judge and prosecutors say they were limited in their sentencing ability by the evidence they had available—as WFSB points out, investigators could not prove O'Kelly's blood alcohol content at the time of the crash. Cell phone records showed that O'Kelly was on his phone at the time of the accident, and witnesses said he had been drinking at a tavern earlier in the night and appeared intoxicated. But one potential witness—his girlfriend, who allegedly told her father that O'Kelly was drunk at the time—never testified, as O'Kelly married her, and Missouri law does not require spouses to testify in such cases. O'Kelly, who had a prior DUI conviction and who told the family he was  super sorry about what happened,  was sentenced to seven years on a charge of involuntary vehicular manslaughter due to intoxication and four years on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, to be served concurrently. But as part of the plea deal, both sentences were suspended as O'Kelly serves a 120-day callback sentence—and if that goes without incident, he'll get probation instead of further jail time.

Giuliani denied the reports, telling the Times that he  never asked for $20,000  and  the arrangement is, we'll work it out at the end.  Giuliani was granted permission to participate just before the Tuesday hearing on Pennsylvania's motion to dismiss a Trump campaign lawsuit to block certification of election results began, Bloomberg reports. Giuliani alleged that Democrats had allowed widespread fraud to take place by blocking monitoring of mail-in ballots.  If this is allowed without serious sanctions, this will become an epidemic,  he told Judge Matthew Brann. Mark Aronchick, a lawyer for several county election boards, called Giuliani's attempt to have 700,000 mail-in ballots invalidated  disgraceful  and accused him of living in a  fantasy world.  During the Brann hearing, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed another defeat to the Trump campaign with a 5-2 opinion that officials had given GOP observers sufficient access to vote-counting in Philadelphia, the AP reports.",Report: Giuliani Asked to Be Paid $20K a Day
"(Dec 10, 2014  8:29 AM) A Boston-area Chinese restaurant charging $1 more per plate than it advertises on its online menu may have served the wrong guy—a Harvard Business School professor specializing in online advertising fraud who wasted no time in pulling out the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Statute and threatening legal action. According to a lengthy email exchange published by the Boston Globe, Ben Edelman is seriously agitated, and though the mom-and-pop shop only overcharged him $4, he says it's the principle.  If you look at my other work ... you'll see I've been pretty diligent in holding large companies accountable for their false statements of price and other attempts to overcharge passengers,  he tells Business Insider.  Should all small businesses get a free pass?  The restaurant, Sichuan Garden, appears to have thus far complied with Edelman's requests, including refunding him $12 (three times what he was overcharged) and updating the online menu to reflect actual prices. Ran Duan, who tends bar at the restaurant for his parents, recently told the Globe:  I personally respond to every complaint and try to handle every situation personally. ... I have worked so hard to make my family proud and to elevate our business. [This exchange] just broke my heart.  It just so happens that GQ Magazine featured Duan last month, hailing him as  America's Most Imaginative Bartender.  (Speaking of overcharging, Sprint is being accused of padding this bill—to the tune of $21 million.)",Harvard Prof Flips Over $4 Chinese Food Overcharge
"(Sep 20, 2017  12:27 AM CDT) Police say seven officers were injured during a weekend shootout in central Oklahoma, including one who remains hospitalized. Police initially said two officers were wounded Sunday as they tried to serve a search warrant following a kidnapping attempt in Chickasha, about 40 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, the AP reports. Chickasha Police Chief Goebel Music said Tuesday that seven officers were injured after the suspect allegedly opened fire from a home. Music says two officers were taken to a hospital. One was treated for shrapnel wounds and released. The other was repeatedly shot in the arm and remains hospitalized. Music says the five other officers were treated at the scene for lesser injuries. The suspect, 61-year-old Alex Warren Klingler, is jailed on complaints including shooting with intent to kill. Music says police went to Klingler's home after he allegedly tried to pull a woman into his car, using so much force that both her wrists were broken, the Chickasha Express-Star reports. Five officers fired their weapons during the hour-long standoff.  No member of the Chickasha Police Department or any other agency left their post, but they stood their ground against an assailant who had attempted grievous harm on a woman within our community,  the chief says.",7 Cops Injured in Oklahoma Shootout

"(Jul 11, 2019  10:05 AM CDT) Technology and communications companies pushed stocks higher on Wall Street in early trading Thursday, extending the market's gains from the day before. The early buying briefly nudged the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 27,000-point mark for the first time, a day after the S&P 500 made its first move above 3,000, the AP reports. The Dow has since come down a bit; as of this writing, it was at 26,985. The market shook off a two-day slide earlier this week and has been trending higher as investors have grown more confident that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates for the first time in a decade as soon as the end of July. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said many Fed officials believe a weakening global economy and rising trade tensions have strengthened the case for a rate cut. The remarks came as Powell gave testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He was due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday. The market rallied through much of June after the central bank first signaled that it was prepared to cut rates to offset slowing global growth and the fallout from US trade conflicts. Chipmaker Nvidia was among the big gainers in the technology sector in early trading Thursday; the stock climbed 2.3%. CenturyLink led the gainers in the communications sector, rising 1.3%. Banks also helped lift the market. They got a boost from a pickup in the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rose to 2.08% from 2.06% late Wednesday.

Security forces raided the Bataclan concert hall, killing at least two attackers wielding assault weapons, police said. One official described  carnage  inside the hall, saying the attackers had tossed explosives at the hostages. It was one of at least six attacks Friday night in the French capital. One of the targets was the nation's main sports stadium, where President Francois Hollande was attending a soccer game. He was evacuated safely when at least two bombs, apparently the work of suicide attackers, went off near the stadium. As of now, the total death is about 140, reports Reuters, but that is expected to rise. At the White House, President Obama expressed solidarity with France, reports the New York Times.

Wallace Bock and Irving H. Kamsler will each receive $500,000, plus additional monies for their roles as executors of the estate and members of the new foundation's board. The Manhattan DA's office is investigating the duo's handling of Clark's money, a source tells the New York Times. Relatives have questioned Bock's and Kamsler's intentions in the past, and accused them of blocking visits from Clark's relatives. Bock's own drafting of the 2005 will is also raising eyebrows. The will explicitly declares that no family members receive anything after her death. Clark's nurse is the biggest individual beneficiary, receiving a doll collection that could be worth millions as well as 60% of various assets worth some $40 million. Most of Clark's assets, including an oceanfront Santa Barbara estate and most of her art collection, which includes works by Monet and Renoir, will go into a foundation that will be created to promote the arts.

"(Dec 13, 2010  9:52 AM) The suicide bomber who killed himself in Stockholm carried three sets of bombs and had sent threats referring to  jihad  in an email shortly before his death, a prosecutor said today. Prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand identified the suicide bomber behind Saturday's blasts as 28-year-old Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen with roots in the Middle East who has lived in Britain for the past 10 years. Though he had apparently harbored radical ideas for some time, Lindstrand said he was completely unknown to Swedish security police before the blasts. Parts of the explosives probably detonated by mistake before Abdulwahab reached his final destination, he said.  He had three sets of bombs and I don't think his intention was to blow himself up only,  Lindstrand said.  It was a failure, luckily.  He said Abdulwahab had bombs strapped to his body, more in a backpack and also carried  something that looked like a pressure-cooker ...

"(Dec 11, 2013  10:21 AM) A judge has awarded nearly $80 million to the family of a woman who died in 2002 when a tractor-trailer struck her car and buried it in sand, suffocating the woman as teachers and students at a nearby school frantically tried to dig her out. Laura Miera had just dropped off her 14-year-old daughter at Jimmy Carter Middle School and was waiting at a traffic light when the semi exited a freeway and came barreling toward her. The Albuquerque Redi-Mix truck pushed her car to the curb, it rolled, and Miera was trapped as the semi's open load of sand poured on top of her. Teachers, students, and others on their way to the school tried to dig out the 48-year-old woman by hand. One counselor tried to comfort Miera as the car filled with sand.  It was devastating,  said Jacob Vigil, the attorney who has represented Miera's family in their 10-year legal fight.  The school counselor was holding her hand, praying while the sand just rose above her head, and the counselor just kept saying 'Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.' She squeezed for a while until she died.  According to the lawsuit, the semi involved in the crash had an expired registration, three brakes out of adjustment, and a driver with two DWI charges before he was hired by Albuquerque Redi-Mix.

"(Dec 5, 2011  3:10 AM) Britain's queen is facing a royal comedown as new austerity measures will likely trim her income to some $48 million, which will be frozen until 2015. It's actually a sizable cut from the good old days in 1991, when her take was a hefty $125 million. So what does it mean?

Asked if she'd be running on Fox today, Bachmann seemed caught off guard, according to the Hill.  I, very—yes,  she said.  I believe I'll be looking at that.  But in the AP interview she was much more confident.  I'm looking forward to coming back and bringing a strong, powerful voice to Washington, DC,  she said. The Minnesota rep has been quiet since her presidential campaign went belly-up, fostering suspicions she might run for Senate or resign entirely. But even her re-election to the House isn't a gimme: In a recent Public Policy Polling survey of Minnesota, a mere 37% said Bachmann should run, though Politico notes that those numbers come from the entire state, not just her district.

More than 13,000 such babies were diagnosed in the US in 2009. Ill-prepared hospitals have created different treatments, with one giving babies methodone and another trying morphine. But then newborns have to be weaned off of those drugs. Worse, care for drug-addicted babies can take weeks and fatten hospital bills; one study found a mean cost of $53,400, with Medicaid covering 78% of the cases.

Today it's CBS making that call with CBS All Access, an on-demand service that offers streaming of current and past seasons of popular CBS shows, as well as classic shows, for $5.99 a month, TVLine.com reports. According to a CBS press release, the service offers new episodes of 15 current prime-time shows the day after they air; live-streaming of local CBS stations in 14 markets (with more to be added); full past seasons of favorites like Survivor and The Good Wife;  CBS Classics  like Twin Peaks and Cheers; and the ability to live-stream Big Brother around the clock. The service is meant to attract the demographic that uses Netflix, the New York Times notes—those the Times calls  cord nevers  (people who’ve never paid for TV packages) and  cord cutters  (those who've nixed their cable or satellite subs). The idea isn't making everyone reach for the remote. First, you won't find NFL games on the service, though CBS execs are pushing other sports that are available for live-streaming and reportedly talking to the NFL about future possibilities. Kate Knibbs comes down harshly on the plan, writing at Gizmodo that this  is possibly the worst streaming TV deal out there,  noting the fact that viewers have to sit through ads for current shows, just like on regular TV (the classic shows are ad-free), and that—unlike HBO—you can watch CBS for free already. Times tech writer Farhad Manjoo agrees, tweeting,  Offering to let you pay $5.99 a month for shows you can get for free is just why TV has done so well in the digital age.

"(Apr 13, 2014  5:10 AM CDT) Chile has been rocked by earthquakes lately, and now a fire raging in the colorful port city of Valparaiso has killed at least 16 people and destroyed 500 homes, President Michelle Bachelet said today. More than 10,000 people have been evacuated, including more than 200 female inmates at a prison.  It's a tremendous tragedy, perhaps the worst fire  in the city's history, said Bachelet, who warned that the toll of death and damage would rise. The fire began yesterday afternoon in a forested area above ramshackle housing on one of the city's many hilltops, and spread quickly as high winds rained hot ash over wooden houses and narrow streets in the city of 250,000. Electricity failed as the fire spread, and towering, sparking flames turned the night sky orange over the darkened remains of entire neighborhoods. Bachelet declared the entire city a catastrophe zone, putting Chile's military in charge of maintaining order. While 1,250 firefighters, police and forest rangers battled the blaze, 2,000 Chilean sailors in combat gear patrolled streets to maintain order and prevent looting. Shelters were overflowing, and hospitals treated hundreds of people for breathing problems provoked by the smoke. Valparaiso, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003, is known for colorful neighborhoods hugging hills so steep that people have to use staircases rather than streets. About 75 miles northwest of the capital, Santiago, it has a vibrant port and is home to Chile's national legislature.

That entry and others describing the journal writer breaking into a house to steal food or keeping tabs on the ensuing manhunt were read to a Pennsylvania jury during Frein's murder trial on Wednesday, reports the NBC News. The 33-year-old is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson II and critically injuring Trooper Alex Douglass outside the Blooming Grove barracks in Pike County on Sept. 12, 2014. The shooting spawned a 48-day manhunt before Frein was captured near an abandoned airplane hangar on Oct. 30.  This massive search cannot last forever,  an Oct. 4 entry reads. Days later, Frein allegedly wrote,  30 Days. A lot longer than I expected to last.

The decision came about quite organically, like most things in REM,  he says. By the end of that tour—which became their last— we all kind of knew that these were most likely going to be our last shows. It was already, for us, bittersweet and weird and hard.  He says the thought of not performing live again is  actually painful to think about,  but the band didn’t want to leave things open-ended because the members needed  closure  in order to move forward with new projects. Why not do a farewell tour?  The idea of doing some kind of victory lap … just felt—and still feels—like it would have been completely mercenary and exploitative and impossible,  Stipe says. Not to mention emotional for the band:  I could not perform ‘Everybody Hurts’ for the last time in London with 30,000 people in the room or 80,000 people on the field knowing full well it was the last time we were going to do it.

"(Oct 21, 2016  10:06 AM CDT) There have long been complaints about the lack of women in the tech industry. Now there's a towering female figure, in a tech park across the bay from San Francisco, although not quite what some people had in mind. A 55-foot-tall statue of a nude woman unveiled this week in the community of San Leandro is stirring controversy and a lot of conversation, the AP reports. At the base of the 13,000-pound statue is a message in 10 languages that says:  What would the world be like if women were safe?  The statue—roughly three times as tall as Michelangelo's David—is made of steel mesh in the form of a graceful dancer, with an arched back and arms stretched overhead. The debate, however, is not over its artistic merit—it's over whether it's appropriate in public. The Truth Is Beauty statue by sculptor Marco Cochrane is on private property at the edge of a new tech office complex, in a highly trafficked area just across from San Leandro's commuter rail station. Cochrane says he was marked as a child by the rape of a neighborhood friend and tries through art to bring attention to sexual assault, and to both the fear and strength many women feel. Not everyone shares his views on the statue, now attracting selfie-seekers.  If she's a ballerina, she should have some clothes on,  says a local mom. But others have welcomed the statue as a reflection of the changing demographics in San Leandro, where millennials now outnumber older residents.

The site, once a moneymaker for the Times Company (which purchased it for $400 million in 2005), took a big hit after a Google algorithm change last year; revenue was down 8.7% in the last quarter to $25.4 million. Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. says the sale will allow the company to  focus on the development and growth of our core brands.  It follows the unloading of its stake in Boston Red Sox owner Fenway Sports Group in May, as well as the January sale of its regional media business. So why would Diller's IAC (which claims the Daily Beast and Match.com) want what the Atlantic Wire describes as  a website that often muddles our Google search results, yet looks so, so not authoritative ? It offers four theories, like the fact that About.com fits in nicely with other IAC sites that Diller has been able to squeeze a profit out of, like Dictionary.com and Ask.com. And it posits he may be considering mashing up About.com with the latter. Click for more.",Barry Diller's IAC Grabs About.com for $300M

"(Mar 3, 2018  2:40 PM) A new report from the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research found a full 30% of Uber and Lyft drivers are actually losing money while working due to costs associated with the job. The Guardian reports the situation isn't much better for the other 70%, as the median profit for drivers for the two ride-share companies is just $3.37 per hour before taxes. In fact, researchers found 74% of drivers are earning less than their state's minimum wage.  This business model is not currently sustainable,  says Stephen Zoepf, co-author of report.  And the drivers are essentially subsidizing it by working for very low wages.  Researchers surveyed over 1,100 drivers and analyzed vehicle cost data, including insurance, repairs, and fuel.","Report: 30% of Uber, Lyft Drivers Actually Lose Money Driving"
"(Jun 13, 2014  6:45 AM CDT) The cool kids don't exactly win in the end: Teens who try to be cool by acting older than they are may be setting themselves up for future problems, according to a new study in the journal Child Development. Researchers followed 184 Southeastern teens from ethnically diverse backgrounds in public schools for 10 years starting when the teens were 13. The kids deemed popular by their peers tended to be in romantic relationships, engage in delinquent activities, and hang with the prettiest peers, but by 22 those kids were no longer at the top of the totem pole—and were also more likely to be involved in criminal activities and have serious problems with drugs and alcohol, reports Eureka Alert. They were also judged as being less competent in managing social relationships.  We call it the high school reunion effect—the student who was popular and was running with the fast crowd isn't doing as great later on,  the study's lead author tells NPR. The reason, he surmises, may be that as the cool kids aged, they felt they had to do increasingly extreme things to get noticed, while their peers, who were continuing to mature, were less impressed by those behaviors. The researchers stressed that this doesn't mean being cool at 13 is a  life sentence,  but that teens who focus heavily on physical appearance and social hierarchies may be putting all their eggs in the short-term popularity basket instead of the longer-term happiness basket.

The sinkhole, which originally measured nine acres, was created when a salt mine that Houston-based Texas Brine abandoned in 2010 collapsed, NPR reports.

"(Dec 6, 2016  6:10 PM) Humans have built a ton of things to keep us alive on this twirling little rock: farms, airports, roads, CDs, houses, computers, landfills, and so forth. All these things are known as the technosphere, and for the first time ever—in a study published last month in the Anthropocene Review—scientists have estimated their total weight: an impressive 30 trillion tons. According to Forbes, that's  enough to add another good-sized mountain to the Appalachians, or perhaps even to the Rockies.  Or as a press release breaks it down, it's roughly 110 pounds per square meter of the Earth's surface. Researchers say the technosphere is a  major new phenomenon on this planet  that is  evolving extraordinarily rapidly.  It's also a handy means of measuring how much humans have shaped the planet. Scientists argue that the sheer scale of the technosphere is convincing evidence that we're living in a new, as-yet-unofficial geologic epoch known as the  Anthropocene,  Gizmodo reports. The quickest way to be recognized as an epoch is to have a discernible fossil record, and due to the fact that the technosphere is—unlike the biosphere— remarkably poor at recycling its own materials,  that shouldn't be a problem. If  technofossils  from the Anthropocene were classified like normal fossils, there would more than a billion different types, outnumbering the types of species currently alive.

In what the University Medical Center in Utrecht says was a  procedural error,  sperm from a single client may have been accidentally used to fertilize the eggs of up to 26 women, AFP reports. Half the women are either pregnant or have already given birth, while the others apparently have the frozen embryos in storage. The center says there's only a small risk that the egg cells  have been fertilized by sperm other than that of the intended father,  but the possibility  could not be excluded.  The center says the deeply unfortunate mix-up happened between mid-April 2015 and mid-November this year and that it  regrets that the couples involved had to receive this news,  the BBC reports. What officials think happened during the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection procedure, in which sperm is injected directly into an egg using a pipette: A technician changed the pipette during each procedure, but used the same rubber top. Eventually, he noticed traces of old sperm in the top, and as the BBC puts it,  raised the alarm.

But the glow was dimmed by what looks to be a cooling PC  market, leading to lower projections for 2008, and sending Intel’s share price down 14% in after-hours trading, reports the Wall Street Journal. Strong demand and reduced production costs helped Intel’s fourth quarter gross profit margin reach 58%; the company’s revenue rose a disappointing 10.5%.

"(Jul 14, 2009  8:26 AM CDT) Barack Obama will announce a plan today to pump $12 billion into community colleges over the next 10 years, USA Today reports. Most of the money—$9 billion—would reward programs that bolster graduation rates, or help graduates find local jobs. Another $2.5 billion would help seed renovation projects, hoping to spur $10 billion worth of spending. The last $500 million would be used to create free online courses. Though the $12 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the $100 billion in education funding in the stimulus bill, it’s a big upgrade from the $2 billion in direct aid the government now gives to community colleges. Obama hopes to pay for it by cutting private lenders out of the federal student loan program. That would save an estimated $87 billion over 10 years, but it faces opposition in Congress.",Obama to Propose $12B Community College Boost
"(Apr 12, 2020  10:02 AM CDT) On Jan. 30, 2003, 20-year-old Rosa Jimenez was watching 21-month-old Bryan Gutierrez, as she did a few times a week, at her Texas apartment when things went horribly wrong. Jimenez stepped away from Bryan and her own daughter so that she could make lunch as the little ones played and watched TV. The toddlers had been playfully ripping up paper towels, and somehow, Bryan choked on some of them. Jimenez frantically tried to clear his airway and couldn't; ultimately, one of the responding paramedics had to use forceps to remove an egg-sized mass of bloody paper towels from his throat. The boy did not survive. Jimenez, who said she loved Bryan as if he were her own son, was found guilty of his murder. But in an extensive look at the case for Texas Monthly, Michael Hall explains that there are quite a few—including five judges—who believe she was wrongly convicted. While prosecutors argued there was no way a child so young could have stuffed five paper towels down his own throat, a civil lawyer ultimately found a renowned surgeon who said it was  absolutely possible  the incident had been an accidental choking. Three other pediatric specialists agreed. The civil lawyer argued Jimenez's lawyer failed her in various ways, including by using an ineffective expert witness, and an appellate judge ordered a new trial. But in a series of twists and turns, judges, state representatives, the president of Mexico, and others continued to back Jimenez—even the judge from her original trial—yet the woman described as  peaceful  and  loving  on the stand remains behind bars, suffering from a chronic kidney condition that could kill her.

The convoy traveling to register a candidate for a provincial governor was stopped and attacked by at least 100 gunmen yesterday, the AP reports, and candidate Ismael Mangudadatu's wife and two sisters are among the dead. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has vowed to spare no effort to bring those responsible to justice. A dozen journalists were killed in the massacre, believed to be the largest death toll the news media has ever suffered on a single day.  This is a senseless slaughter,  said the director of the International Press Institute.  It is the work of journalists to report on political campaigns on behalf of the public.

The opening bid for the plates offered by Heritage Auctions on Saturday in Dallas was $40,000, but rose quickly.

Police say a toddler came upon the gun inside a bedroom and pulled the trigger, causing a bullet to pass through one 3-year-old boy before hitting another shortly after 10am, report WXYZ and WJBK. The boys were rushed to hospitals in critical condition, one with a gunshot wound to the face, the other with a wound to a shoulder, per CBS Detroit. Reports suggest one or both boys were in either stable or serious condition as of Wednesday night. The sister of the homeowner tells Detroit News that Samantha Eubanks, 31, looked after several children of  friends and family but mostly family  at the home. It's unclear what evidence was taken from the house, though ClickonDetroit.com notes it appeared officers removed hunting rifle cases. Cops say Eubanks' husband is a hunter. Eubanks, however,  totally hates guns  and wouldn't allow them in her home, her sister tells the Detroit News.  This would be her worst nightmare.  Dearborn police are still investigating and are expected to soon hand over the case to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, which could bring charges.

The MS Balmoral, on a cruise retracing the doomed liner's first and final voyage, observed a moment of silence at the site of the sinking with passengers lining the decks, reports the AP. Three wreaths were tossed into the waters.  It was just so eerily quiet,  says the great-niece of one of the ship's victims.  And then you look down over the side of the ship and you realize that every man and woman who was not fortunate enough to get into a lifeboat had to make that decision of when to jump or to stay with the ship, until the lights went out.  Says another passenger aboard the Balmoral,  You still get a chill just looking at that water, imagining you have to go into it.

Jimmy Causey, 46, has been missing from the Lieber Correctional Institution since around 2pm Wednesday, the AP reports. In his previous escape, he broke out of the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 with convicted murderer Johnny Brewer by hiding in a trash truck.

Residents near the Ridgeville, SC, prison have been urged to  remain vigilant, keep vehicles and homes secured  while the search continues. Causey, who first went to state prison for grand larceny in 1992, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping prominent Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his wife and daughter, the Post and Courier reports. He held the lawyer—who had represented him in previous cases—at gunpoint and demanded money.

He was 70. The Austria Press Agency quoted Lauda's family as saying he  passed away peacefully  on Monday.  His tireless drive, his straightforwardness, and his courage remain an example and standard for us all,  his family said in a statement.  Away from the public gaze he was a loving and caring husband, father and grandfather. We will miss him very much.  Born on Feb. 22, 1949 into a wealthy Vienna family, Nikolaus Andreas Lauda was expected to follow his father into the paper-manufacturing industry, but instead concentrated his business talents and determination on his dreams of becoming a racing driver, the AP reports. Lauda won the F1 drivers' championship in 1975 and 1977 with Ferrari and again in 1984 with McLaren. In 1976, he was badly burned when he crashed during the German Grand Prix, but he made an astonishingly fast return to racing just six weeks later.  The main damage, I think to myself, was lung damage from inhaling all the flames and fumes while I was sitting in the car for about 50 seconds,  he recalled nearly a decade later.  It was something like 800 degrees.  Lauda remained closely involved with the F1 circuit after retiring as a driver in 1985, and in recent years served as the non-executive chairman of the Mercedes team.

"(Jul 29, 2020  2:24 PM CDT) It's a good time to be living alone on  one of the most beautiful islands in the entire Mediterranean.  But the quiet paradise Mauro Morandi has enjoyed for 30 years on the Isle of Budelli off the coast of Sardinia will soon be taken from him, reports CNN. Italian authorities plan to refashion the former World War II radio station Morandi occupies into an environmental observatory, meaning the 81-year-old caretaker must clear out. But Morandi is digging in his feet. He says Budelli has been his only home since he arrived by chance while trying to sail to Polynesia in 1989, as the Atlantic reported in 2016. The former teacher fell in love with the one-mile-long parcel of pink sand and took over for the previous caretaker.  I'm ready to do all I can to stay here,  he tells CNN.  I wouldn't know where else to go.  The island has changed ownership numerous times in recent years. Since 2015, it's been owned by the La Maddalena National Park, whose president considers Morandi to be an  illegal occupant  and points out the structure he lives in has been modified in ways that aren't exactly legal either.  Nobody wants to chase him away, but what title does he have to stay since the island is no longer private?  Fabrizio Fonnesu tells CNN. The eviction battle has been ongoing for years, but construction work is now just months away, and Morandi needs to go when it starts, says Fonnesu. Morandi, backed by thousands of supporters, has a request: that authorities agree he can return as caretaker. Otherwise,  they'll have to drag me away.  Fonnesu is making no such promises but says that if a caretaker position opens post-renovation, Morandi could be considered for it—though he points out it would be a highly desirable job.","After 30 Years Alone on an Island, He's Told to Clear Out"

To NASA's relief, the weather cooperated after three days of high wind and cloudy skies that kept the Atlas V rocket firmly on the ground.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday reiterated his rejection of the proposal and the conference.

Fox announced yesterday that its action-packed real-time show starring Kiefer Sutherland as anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer will wind down at the end of its current eighth season on May 24. Sutherland said in a statement that the show's cast and crew  always wanted 24 to finish on a high note, so the decision to make the eighth season our last was one we all agreed upon.

"(Nov 5, 2020  4:24 PM) When the pandemic hit, ESPN was left with hardly any games to show for four months. Sports is back, but ratings and advertising still lag. Now the other shoe has dropped for employees of the cable network. The company is laying off 300 people and not filling another 200 jobs, USA Today reports. ESPN made similar cuts in 2015 and 2017. Contracts for certain on-air employees will be allowed to expire. The network has extended the contracts of some on-air staffers with base salaries below $50,000 and bonuses for each on-air appearance, per the New York Times. Many of them had had much larger contracts that guaranteed a certain number of on-air appearances. ESPN employs about 4,000 people at its Connecticut headquarters and another 2,500 around the world. The cuts will hit broadcast production hardest but reach into most parts of the company. In addition to the pandemic, the network is dealing with unfavorable trends, per the New York Times: As viewers switch to streaming services, the number of US households paying for TV programming has fallen from 100.5 million in 2014 to about 80 million now.  Placing resources in support of our direct-to-consumer business strategy, digital, and, of course, continued innovative television experiences, is more critical than ever,  the network's president wrote in the layoff memo. Disney, the network's owner, also has been hit hard by the pandemic, across most of its divisions. Still, ESPN spends huge amounts on league contracts for programming. Bob Ley, an original ESPN employee in 1979, took a shot at that strategy, per Barrett Sports Media, in a post lamenting the loss of journalistic expertise and experience.  Enjoy the DIS stock price and your NFL football,  Ley tweeted.","ESPN to Lay Off 300, Let Some On-Air Contracts Lapse"

"(Jun 6, 2017  11:32 AM CDT) Some of the biggest names in US soccer are rallying around a little girl who was disqualified from her local soccer club's tournament this weekend. Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm have both publicly supported 8-year-old Mili Hernandez after her story went viral, the AP reports. Hernandez plays for the Azzuri-Cachorros Chicas in Omaha, Neb., and her team was disqualified Sunday after playing in the earlier part of the Springfield Soccer Association girls' tournament—because, her family claims to WOWT, organizers thought Hernandez, whose hair is short, was a boy. The family says they went so far as to show Hernandez's insurance card, with her gender listed, to organizers, but they wouldn't budge.  Mili, don't EVER let anyone tell you that you aren't perfect just as you are.i won championships with short hair,  Wambach wrote on Twitter Monday. Hamm weighed in with her own tweet the same day:  Hey Mili, we would love to host you at one of our camps @TeamFirstSA . Be you!  Organizers later told WOWT that Hernandez's hair wasn't the issue; rather, they say, she was accidentally listed as a boy on the team roster. That didn't change Wambach's support for the girl: She posted on Instagram late Monday night that Hernandez is  my new hero.

Heather Grogg, 33, worked as a live-in babysitter at the home of David Sanford Jr., one of three men charged in the March 18 murder of Jonathan Riddle. In the midst of an argument, Riddle was stabbed twice at Sanford's home, then taken to a rural area in West Virginia, where he was fatally stabbed and set on fire, according to police. Grogg seemed shocked by Riddle's murder, her sister tells NBC News. But  I'm worried she witnessed something she shouldn't have seen,  says Brandie Hebb.  It's not like her to just disappear.  Hebb last heard from her sister, a mother of four, on April 3. Grogg  seemed a little stressed  and  wanted to see me face-to face,  but the sisters opted to forgo a meeting owing to the statewide stay-at-home order. Authorities believe Grogg may be with the other missing woman, 18-year-old Danielle Tyler, who frequented Sanford's home and was dating another of the murder suspects, Monroe Merrell, with whom Riddle apparently argued. Grogg and Tyler were last seen together in Carroll County on April 6, days before the suspects were arrested, per CBS Baltimore. That was also the last time Tyler's grandmother heard from the high school senior.  I think I am going to turn my phone off for a little bit … I am just tired of all the drama,  Tyler wrote in a text, per People.

"(Jun 25, 2013  6:49 AM CDT) The emir of Qatar has abdicated and will hand the reins to his 33-year-old son, who in turn becomes the youngest monarch in the region. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, 61, announced the news on national TV yesterday, though he didn't say when Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani would take over. The younger Sheikh, however, is set to give a speech tomorrow and select a government afterward, the New York Times reports.  I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,  Sheikh Hamad said. He took over from his own father in 1995, though in a decidedly less friendly manner: He launched a bloodless coup. Indeed, this kind of willing handover of power is extremely unusual in Gulf Arab dynasties, the AP notes. There are unconfirmed murmurs that it's related to Sheikh Hamad's health, but he's likely to continue to play a role in government. Though the country's prime minister is also likely to depart, politics in Qatar—whose influence is growing—aren't likely to change much. Sheikh Tamim  has been involved very closely with Qatari policy, both domestic and foreign ... for some considerable time,  says an al Jazeera editor. Qatar has a sovereign wealth fund of some $100 billion, one of the biggest in the world, and it's been building its political resume as a mediator of international conflicts, including Darfur; the Taliban also recently opened a political office in the country.","Qatari Emir Abdicates, Hands Power to Son, 33"

It was also where the 97-year-old died last month in his pajamas, bludgeoned to death by intruders, reports the Washington Post. Intruders kicked in his back door on July 21, and when Tate didn't answer the phone, one of his daughters rushed over to find her father dead on the bedroom floor, covered in blood and blankets. Police determined he died of blunt force trauma, though they've been unable to point to a motive, reports the Baltimore Sun. Nothing appeared to have been stolen from the home and  whatever they needed from him, they could have easily gotten,  notes Baltimore Police Department spokesman TJ Smith. Instead, the apparent intruders opted to kill Tate in a way that was  brutal  and  absolutely inhumane,  says Smith, whose own brother was killed in a break-in weeks ago.

Some 33% said same-sex couples should not be legally recognized at all. The results are more striking when broken down by age, notes CBS: Though the percentage of those 18 to 44 who oppose legal recognition is about the same as the overall average, a full 53% in that age group support gay marriage.

"(Nov 18, 2017  10:17 AM) The (potentially) former prime minister of Lebanon's mysterious two-week stay in Saudi Arabia has come to an end, as Saad Hariri arrived in France on Saturday morning and met with French President Emmanuel Macron, the New York Times reports. Hariri was in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4 when he suddenly and shockingly resigned as prime minister. Since then, Lebanese President Michel Aoun has refused to accept his resignation among widespread speculation Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will, according to the AP. Early Saturday, Hariri tweeted that it was a  lie  that Saudi Arabia was detaining him. However, speculation of Saudi leverage continues as Hariri was joined by his wife and eldest son in France while his younger children—attending school in Saudi Arabia—were notably absent. Aoun says Hariri will return to Lebanon in time for its Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, and it's unclear if Hariri will go ahead with his resignation or take it back upon his return. Hariri told reporters in France that he will  declare my political stance  after meeting with Aoun. He has not publicly discussed what happened during his time in Saudi Arabia. Hariri's resignation and lengthy absence started a political crisis in Lebanon that goes beyond the organization of the government. There is speculation that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign as part of a power struggle with Iran, which Hariri denounced during his resignation, the BBC reports. There is fear of a looming war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which only increased Saturday when Saudi Arabia asked its citizens to leave Lebanon for the second time in two weeks.","After 2 Mysterious Weeks, Lebanese PM Now in France"

Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process.  Under Sabraw's mandate, parents also can't be detained or deported without their kids, unless it's shown a parent is unfit or otherwise poses a danger, and prompt phone contact between parents and kids must be allowed, per NBC News. The injunction was a response to a class-action lawsuit on behalf of two women separated from their children, including a Congolese woman who made headlines. Sabraw's ruling comes on the heels of an executive order from President Trump that was supposed to remedy the separations, but which stayed  silent on the issue of reuniting families that have already been separated or will be separated in the future,  wrote Sabraw, a George W. Bush appointee.  Tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited,  Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement.","Judge: Migrant Kids, Parents Must Be Reunited in 30 Days"
"(Mar 8, 2012  7:29 AM) The number of hate groups in the US has been on the rise for more than a decade, and last year 1,018 were active, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. That's up from 602 in 2000, the New York Times notes. The report cites anger over shifting racial demographics, the income gap, and President Obama as the catalyst for the increase. Anti-government groups aligned with the patriot or militia movements are also exploding: There were 1,274 in operation last year, a  stunning  increase from 824 the year prior. The anti-government organizations  represent both a kind of right-wing populist rage and a left-wing populist rage that has gotten all mixed up in anger toward the government,  says the report's author. The far-right spectrum of the movement had peaked in 1995, following the incidents at Ruby Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City, but has picked up steam again since the recession began in 2008. The SPLC has been tracking these types of groups for 30 years and only includes active groups—those that are registering new members, staging protests, or distributing literature—in its report.","No. of Hate Groups in US: 1,018"
"(Jan 28, 2014  9:01 AM) Driving service Uber now operates in 60 cities and is worth $4 billion, the Boston Globe reports. But the company is under scrutiny for more reasons than one, including this big one: A driver hit a 6-year-old girl on New Year's Eve, killing her, and a lawsuit was filed yesterday. It names the driver as well as the company, and says the app-based service is breaking California laws against distracted driving. According to the filing, driver Syed Muzzafar, 57, was using the UberX app to find his next customer when he hit Sofia Liu; the girl's mother and brother were also hurt. Uber drivers  must respond quickly to a user request for service by physically interfacing with the app, thereby leading to distraction,  the suit says. State law requires hands-free devices, but an Uber driver can't grab a fare without pressing the screen at least once. The family's lawyer also says that Uber failed to provide insurance to cover the scenario: Muzzafar had no fare in his car when he hit Sofia; state rules call for insurance to cover drivers while on trips for Uber, says an expert, but it's less clear about insurance for drivers between passengers, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Uber says that since Muzzafar didn't have a passenger, Uber has no culpability in the matter; his lawyer maintains the opposite.  He was waiting for a fare. He was working for Uber.  Police arrested Muzzafar on suspicion of manslaughter, but he hasn't been charged.",Uber Sued After Driver Kills 6-Year-Old
"(Oct 20, 2012  5:46 PM CDT) Tehran and Washington have agreed to the first-ever direct talks about Iran's nuclear program, but only after Nov. 6—because Iran insists on meeting with a newly elected president, the New York Times reports. The plan could easily fall through, however—either because Iran is bluffing to ease international pressure, or Mitt Romney, if elected, takes a hard line and refuses to meet. Plus Iran is trying to link the talks to other issues, like Syria and Bahrain, which could draw howls from Washington. The proposed negotiations are also fraught with election-year politics, the Times notes. While President Obama could trumpet the talks as a diplomatic breakthrough, opponents may argue that Iran is using him to buy time. Romney is in a tight spot too, because he has opposed letting Iran enrich any uranium—a likely concession if the talks occur. And Israel is already balking:  We do not think Iran should be rewarded with direct talks,  said Israel's US ambassador,  rather that sanctions and all other possible pressures on Iran must be increased.","US, Iran Agree to 1st Direct Nuclear Talks"

"(Nov 7, 2015  11:00 AM) Reading 100,000 books in a lifetime sounds impossible. Authoring that many sounds unthinkable, but that's exactly what Philip M. Parker can proclaim he has done. The professor at business school INSEAD calls himself  the most published author in the history of the planet  and claims 200,000 titles to his name, though Amazon puts the number at 107,566. Parker, born in 1960, doesn't profess to have typed his way to his immense total, a collection that includes titles like The 2007-2012 Outlook for Public Building Stacking Chairs Excluding Bar, Bowling Center, Cafeteria, Library, Restaurant, and School Stacking Chairs in India. After all, doing so would mean he has churned out six books a day since the moment he was born, per Now I Know. Rather, for about 15 years Parker has owned a patent for computer software that writes books for him by employing info that's publicly available. A 2008 profile in the New York Times said he generated his collection via those algorithms, six or seven programmers, and 60 to 70 computers. Most books aren't actually printed until someone buys a copy, and there are many titles to choose from: Phys.org in late 2012 reported another 700,000 books on Amazon are listed under Parker's company, ICON Group International; it looks like nearly another 100,000 have been added since then. They're also essentially useless to you  if you are good at the Internet,  he concedes. As for how much he profits from his books—which can cost as little as $2.23 (for Ecstasy: Webster's Quotations, Facts and Phrases) to $495 for the aforementioned chairs book—he doesn't, or at least he said he didn't in a 2008 Q&A.

"(Mar 5, 2016  12:12 PM) Four Catholic nuns and 12 others were killed during an attack on a home for the elderly Friday in Yemen, in what the Vatican is condemning as an  act of senseless and diabolical violence,  CNN reports. According to the AP, six gunmen got past the home's gate in the city of Aden by pretending they were visiting their mothers. Four then entered the building and went from room to room, handcuffing victims and shooting them in the head. The nuns, members of an organization founded by Mother Teresa, were acting as nurses in the home and serving breakfast when the gunmen entered, the BBC reports. One nun was able to escape death by hiding inside a fridge. Two of the killed nuns were from Rwanda, one was from India, and another was from Kenya. A Yemeni cook and Yemeni guards were among the other victims. Pope Francis was  shocked and profoundly saddened  by the violence, according to a Vatican press release. The Vatican's secretary of state says the Pope  prays that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart, and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.  A spokesperson for the nuns' organization, the Missionaries of Charity, says the nuns decided to stay in Yemen longer than required in order to continue helping people. The identity of the gunmen is unclear, but Yemeni officials are blaming ISIS. Yemen is in the midst of a civil war, which is being used as cover by both ISIS and al-Qaeda.

"(Aug 7, 2019  7:17 AM CDT) That NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre scoped out a $6 million Dallas mansion as a possible new residence isn't being contested. What is: Whose idea it was and where the money was going to come from. The Wall Street Journal and Washington Post are out with stories about the potential estate transaction, which never came to fruition, against the backdrop of the NRA's tussle with its former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen. Their 30-year relationship fell apart earlier this year, and in April the NRA announced it was suing. The Post explains the mansion revelation comes as part of the New York attorney general's office's probe of the NRA's tax-exempt status, which surfaced documents related to the considered purchase. The Journal's sources say that after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., LaPierre was concerned about his own security and the fact that his Virginia address was widely known. An NRA rep says then-agency CEO Angus McQueen, who died in July, suggested the agency purchase the house as an investment property for LaPierre to live in. Per the rep,  The deal was vetoed by the NRA after its full terms—including Ackerman’s intent to spend NRA money—became known.  But other sources say the idea was LaPierre's, and that it was McQueen who scuttled the deal after learning its terms; per the source, LaPierre wanted to also become a member of the tony golf club beside the property, which led McQueen to question whether LaPierre's motivation was really security-based.

"(Apr 6, 2016  5:25 PM CDT) For 29 years, motel owner Gerald Foos watched hundreds, perhaps thousands, of guests having sex, going to the bathroom, and more at the Manor House Motel in Colorado. Now the story of the  greatest voyeur in the world  is out in the open, thanks to an article published in the New Yorker by journalist Gay Talese. The author says he first learned of Foos when the latter wrote him a letter in 1980.  Sexually, I have witnessed, observed, and studied the best first hand, unrehearsed, non-laboratory sex between couples, and most other conceivable sex deviations during these past 15 years,  it read. Foos—who sold the motel in 1995—wanted to be seen as a  sex researcher and social observer,  not a mere Peeping Tom and pervert, according to the Denver Post. To that end, Foos kept detailed notes of everything he witnessed through his fake ceiling vents. For example, in 1973 he catalogued 184 male orgasms and 33 female orgasms, and noted that white heterosexuals tended to have missionary sex and that only 3% of his guests failed to have sex. Talese even joined Foos in his attic  laboratory  on at least one occasion and found the man had an  uncontrollable desire to peer into other people's lives.  The statute of limitations has passed on any voyeur-related crimes, reports the Post, but Talese writes that Foos could face trouble over a 1977 murder he says he witnessed but never reported—assuming it actually happened. Foos tells the Post that Talese's article could  create a real situation.   I don't know if I'm ready for anything, to be honest with you,  he says.  I'm just a poor soul.  Foos maintains that no guests were ever harmed by his voyeurism as they never knew they were being watched.

TMZ has video of the  bizarre naked struggle  Monday night between 22-year-old Buffalo Bills receiver Zay Jones and his older brother, 25-year-old Cayleb Jones, a receiver for the Minnesota Vikings. The skirmish went down in a Los Angeles apartment building, where the party who was naked—Zay Jones—can be heard in the video yelling,  I'm going to fight for Jesus  before briefly scuffling with Cayleb in a hallway, then running out of the frame as a woman in the background screams; TMZ identifies her as Cayleb's girlfriend and says it was her apartment they were near. Witnesses tell TMZ Zay Jones eventually made his way onto a public balcony on the 30th floor and smashed his foot through a window, with Cayleb having to restrain him from leaping out of the hole. In the video, the aftermath can be seen, with the walls and carpet in the vicinity splattered with blood and a woman in the background saying it looks like a  f---ing murder scene.  An LAPD rep confirms to the Buffalo News that a man identified later as  Isaiah Jones  (Zay Jones' official name) had smashed  doors and windows  at the building, and that they brought him into custody close to midnight.

Lots, as in 2.3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2010, reports the San Jose Mercury News. That's enough for about 200,000 houses. The company released its energy figures for the first time today, and one exec tells the New York Times that while the number sounds enormous, critics should consider that Google helps the world save energy, too.

Analysis of the cat bones found in a millet-farming village suggest that cats were living alongside humans 5,300 years ago, long before the previous earliest-known records of cats living with people in Egypt 4,000 years ago. Researchers believe the cats lived in human settlements and were tolerated because of their ability to catch rats and mice, though the remains of an older cat show that its diet was heavy in grain, raising the  possibility that this cat was unable to hunt and scavenged for discarded human food or that it was looked after and fed by people.

Bush said today at a ceremony dedicating the first phase of a memorial at the nation's newest national park. Bush also pointed to what he called a shining example of democracy in action, referring to the group's decision to hold a vote to decide to try to overpower the hijackers. He was among several high-profile speakers at the ceremony, including Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, and John Boehner. Biden said that the actions of the Flight 93 passengers will always be recalled gratefully, for defining their country and sacrificing their lives so that others could live, the AP reports. Clinton said he and Boehner will mount a bipartisan effort to raise the remaining $10 million needed to completely fund the Flight 93 National Memorial, and he praised those aboard the plane as heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice.","Clinton, Bush, Biden Speak at Flight 93 Memorial"
"(Dec 9, 2020  1:43 AM) In early November, Erika Becerra, who was eight months pregnant, had to spend two days in a hospital for observation after she started experiencing mild contractions. When she got home, she soon felt awful.  She called my mom that Monday morning [and said], 'Mom, I think they hurt me at the hospital, it hurts to breathe, it hurts to move, I don’t feel good,'  her brother tells BuzzFeed. She tested positive for COVID-19 on Nov. 7, was hospitalized by Nov. 11, and had deteriorated so much three days later that labor was induced. Her son was born Nov. 15—but she never even got to hold him. She was intubated almost immediately after the birth, the New York Times reports, and she was dead 18 days later. The 33-year-old had no other known health issues.  Let's make Erika proud and raise awareness,  reads a GoFundMe campaign set up for the family, which also includes a 1-year-old daughter.

Vincent Legrend Walters had been living in Cancun under the name Oscar Rivera, working for a nearby resort's airport store for about 10 years. Apparently not a particularly brilliant criminal, Walters had reportedly bragged that he was a wanted fugitive from San Diego.

MGA says it dreamed up a Lady Gaga doll and paid Universal Music Group’s merchandising company $1 million, after being assured Gaga and her people approved of the dolls. But neither Universal nor Gaga ever gave final approval, so MGA filed a $10 million lawsuit. MGA asked the court to demand that final approval be given—the company says it needs to move forward now in order to prep prototypes in time—but the judge refused to issue the order. He said he would consider the request again next month, but MGA lawyers say by then it may be too late to manufacture the dolls in time for the holiday shopping season.

Drawing on ideas of Naomi Klein, Caplan sees radically free market policies dominating the world since 9/11, from Iraq oil reserves to private mercenary armies to public facilities closed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Then came  the catastrophic economic collapse engineered by the geniuses of Wall Street,  and  the latest elite consensus —austerity programs—which have hurt people even more.

Hurricane Katrina, in many ways, was not as impactful as Hurricane Sandy, believe it or not,  the New York governor said.  Because of the density of New York, the number of people affected, the number of properties affected was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than Hurricane Katrina.  Still,  Katrina had a human toll that thankfully we have not paid in this region.  Katrina was to blame for 1,866 deaths; Sandy was responsible for about 100, the New York Post notes. Sandy, however, damaged some 305,000 homes and 265,300 businesses, while Katrina hit 214,700 homes and 18,700 businesses. Cuomo put the storm's damage, plus the cost of preparations for future storms, at $42 billion. The comparison between storms  puts the entire conversation ... in focus,  says Cuomo—but is the comparison valid?

Jerry Correll, 59, was pronounced dead at 7:36pm at Florida State Prison after receiving a lethal injection. The execution came after the US Supreme Court rejected his latest appeals.

The statistics were released during the opening address of a hearing of Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the AP reports. The royal commission—which is Australia's highest form of inquiry—has been investigating since 2013 how the Catholic Church and other institutions responded to the sexual abuse of children over decades. Commissioners surveyed church authorities and found that between 1980 and 2015, 4,444 people reported they had been abused at more than 1,000 Catholic institutions across Australia, said Gail Furness, the lead lawyer assisting the commission. The average age of the victims was 10.5 for girls and 11.5 for boys. Francis Sullivan, CEO of the Truth Justice and Healing Council, which is coordinating the Catholic Church's response to the inquiry, said the data reflected  a massive failure  by the church to protect children.

The Democratic candidate has spent $63,000 with the network for five days' worth of ads targeting Sunshine State markets starting Thursday. But while it's a smart pre-election purchase in terms of viewership (the Weather Channel is likely to see a surge of watchers as the storm progresses), it could backfire if voters think Clinton is exploiting a dangerous situation for political benefit. (Politico notes other candidates, including Donald Trump, have also bought Weather Channel ads in 2016.

But 70-year-old Ronald Brockmeyer has another problem: more than $170,000 in outstanding taxes, the Guardian reports. According to tax liens filed by the IRS, Brockmeyer's federal debts include tens of thousands in personal income taxes, and tens more in employer taxes for his law firm and a yearly tax bosses pay to support the unemployed. On the bright side, he recently paid off three unpaid bills that come to $64,599. The judge, who owns three properties around St. Louis, didn't respond to several Guardian phone calls and emails seeking comment. The Dept. of Justice says he's a top player in Ferguson's strategy of generating revenue through its municipal court—which is blamed for ruining relations between the city's mostly black residents and white officials. Brockmeyer's court has allegedly jailed poor people who couldn't pay fines, and he's admitted to inventing court fees that are often  widely considered abusive and may be unlawful,  investigators say. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that like others in St. Louis County's court system, Brockmeyer is a judge one day and prosecutor the next—which some legal experts say creates a conflict of interest.

UNICEF's  Violence Against Children  report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 Supreme Court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it—and in 1995, Alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so.

Afghan officials said today's suicide attack took place in Kandahar's Zhari district, where Mullah Mohammad Omar organized the Taliban in the early 1990s. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the blast, saying the insurgent group was retaliating for attacks on its fighters in the area in recent months. NATO said that the six service members had been killed in an insurgent attack and did not disclose their nationality.

"(Feb 12, 2010  3:50 AM) Republican Debra Medina's campaign for Texas governor went on damage control yesterday after a disastrous Glenn Beck interview in which she refused to deny that she believes the US government was behind the 9/11 attacks.  There's some very good arguments and I think the American people have not seen all the evidence, so I've not taken a position,  the candidate told Beck. Medina put out a statement soon after denying any links to the  9/11 truther  movement, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Her rivals for the GOP nomination were quick to attack her comments. Medina had shot from 4% to 24% in the polls in recent weeks, but Beck figured the rise may be over.  I think I can write her off the list,  he scoffed after thanking Medina for the interview.

"(Jun 4, 2018  1:45 PM CDT) Saudi Arabia issued its first driver's licenses to 10 women on Monday as the kingdom prepared to lift the world's only ban on women driving in three weeks, but some who campaigned for the right to drive remain under arrest. A government statement said the 10 women who were issued licenses already held driving licenses from other countries, including the US, UK, Lebanon, and Canada. They took a brief driving test and eye exam before being issued the licenses at the General Department of Traffic in the capital, Riyadh, the AP reports. A video of the first woman receiving her license quickly went viral on Twitter, Al Arabiya reports. Other women across the country have been preparing for the right to drive on June 24 by taking driving courses on female-only college campuses. Some are even training to become drivers for ride hailing companies like Uber. Saudi women had long complained of having to hire costly male drivers, use taxis, or rely on male relatives to get to work and run errands. The surprise move to issue some women licenses early came as activists who had campaigned for the right to drive remain under arrest, facing possible trial. Saudi Arabia's prosecutor said Sunday that 17 people had been detained in recent weeks on suspicion of trying to undermine security and stability, a case activists said targeted prominent women's rights campaigners. The prosecutor's statement said eight have been temporarily released, while five men and four women remain under arrest. Among the women held since May 15 are Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Nafjan, according to people with knowledge of the arrests. The three are among the most outspoken and well-known women's rights activists in Saudi Arabia.",10 Women in Saudi Arabia Get Licenses

Police say the starving children were living with five adults in an underground trailer near Amalia, NM, the BBC reports. The compound was searched after officers watching the property received a message that said:  We are starving and need food and water.  Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe says the children, ages 1 to 15, were being kept in  the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,  the Washington Post reports. Two men, described by the sheriff as heavily armed, uncooperative, and possible Islamic extremists were arrested. Three women, believed to be the children's mothers, were detained and later released. Police say one of the men, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, has been charged with abducting his 3-year-old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, from Jonesboro, Ga., last year.

"(Dec 6, 2018  9:10 AM) For nearly 70 years, Genevieve Purinton believed the baby girl she delivered in an Indiana hospital died soon after birth. This week in Florida, however, she met that baby girl, now a 69-year-old mother and grandmother, very much alive and working as a massage therapist in Vermont.  I'm not dead,  Connie Moultroup laughed as she hugged her mother Monday for the first time ever in a Tampa assisted-living center; FOX 13 has video of their emotional reunion. When an 18-year-old Purinton gave birth to Moultroup in 1949,  I asked to see the baby and they said she died, that's all I remember,  the 88-year-old tells NBC News. Yahoo Lifestyle notes she was never given a death certificate, and she never had any other children. But Moultroup hadn't died: She'd actually been adopted, and her adoptive mother died when she was 5, Moultroup's daughter, Bonnie Chase, tells NBC, adding that a stepmom who eventually entered the picture was abusive.  She would fantasize about her [biological] mother rescuing her,  Chase says. What finally brought Purinton and Moultroup together: Ancestry.com DNA-testing kits that Chase bought for her mom and herself last Christmas. Chase's results led her to a bunch of cousins, who noted their relation to Purinton. Then the phone call came.  I think I'm your mother,  Moultroup recalls Purinton saying. Purinton is now thrilled to discover she not only has a daughter, but that she's a grandmother and great-grandmother, too.  I don't think Santa can outdo this one,  Moultroup tells Yahoo.

According to the Mercury News, police identified the 12-year-old victim as Yolanda Ceja. Yolanda was reportedly on an outing with her family at a Lake View Terrace ranch when the horse she was riding with her 4-year-old little sister reared, tossing the two of them to the ground. The horse then fell onto the girls. They were rushed to a hospital, where Yolanda was pronounced dead Tuesday night. Her little sister was listed in critical condition, likely with a collapsed lung, but is expected to survive, per KABC.

"(Apr 6, 2018  7:21 AM CDT) More details in the case of Saheed Vassell, an unarmed, mentally ill 34-year-old man shot and killed by NYC police. Four cops opened fire on Vassell in Brooklyn on Wednesday after 911 calls came in saying a man was pointing a silver firearm at people; after Vassell was shot, it was revealed the supposed gun was really a metal pipe with a showerhead attached, per NPR. The NYPD released transcripts Thursday from the 911 calls, as well as security camera footage from the Crown Heights neighborhood where the shooting took place. In the video, Vassell approaches several people on the street—including what appears to be an adult with a child—and aims what many believed to be a firearm at them.  He looks like he's crazy, but he's pointing something at people that looks like a gun and he's like popping it as if … he's pulling the trigger,  one 911 transcript reads. The city's medical examiner found Vassell was shot nine times; NYPD Chief Terence Monahan says his officers fired 10 times. That, along with the fact that Vassell was known to local cops to be mentally ill—his father tells the New York Times his son had bipolar disorder—has residents especially upset. Witnesses say the police seemed to start firing right away upon confronting Vassell; Monahan says the officers fired after Vassell took a  two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers.  The Times notes while there were local beat cops who'd previously dealt with Vassell and knew of his mental illness, the officers who responded Wednesday to this more urgent call were reportedly not familiar with him— a hole in the neighborhood policing model,  per a Columbia professor. New York AG Eric Schneiderman says his office is investigating.","911 Transcripts, Video Out After Fatal Shooting of NYC Man"
"(Mar 27, 2017  8:55 AM CDT) Since he started campaigning for his job, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has promised that marijuana legalization was high on his to-do list. Now his Liberal government is apparently about to make good on that vow: Per the CBC, pot will be legalized throughout the entire country by July 1, 2018, with legislation on the issue to be unveiled on April 10. (The Toronto Star cites another report that says the pot holiday 4/20 may be the target date, though the Globe and Mail notes the House of Commons will be on break during 4/20 week.) While quality control over the cannabis will fall to the federal government for safety reasons, and licensing will come out of Ottawa, each Canadian province will wield control over cost, distribution, and where pot can be sold. The nationwide age to legally buy marijuana will be set at 18, though provinces will be able to up that minimum. The legislation follows recommendations in a 106-page report by a federal task force. This may slow the roll of Trudeau's political opponents—specifically the New Democrats—who've recently tried to nail the prime minister for breaking his campaign promise, which some have insinuated was made just to get votes. This premise has been helped along by the fact that Trudeau has remained firm on  [enforcing] the law  as it stands now, including hitting illegal pot dispensaries with criminal charges, the Star has reported. Although the latest news may boost Trudeau's credibility, a senior federal official tells the Globe that crafting the legislation is  big and complicated,  with  lots of moving parts,  and there have been rumblings that pot that's legal for recreational users may not happen until 2019 due to the complexities.

"(Apr 3, 2019  8:20 AM CDT) As the Trump administration continues to try to dismantle ObamaCare, with a GOP plan now not expected until after the 2020 election, some sobering statistics have emerged underscoring the necessity for affordable health care. Per the New York Times, a survey released Tuesday by Gallup and the West Health nonprofit shows about 25% of respondents have held off on medical treatment because of the cost, while 45% are afraid they'll go bankrupt in the event of a  major health event,  per a release. Another big number from the survey, which polled 3,500 US adults by phone in early 2019: the $88 billion Americans have borrowed over the past year to pay for health care.  Our data shows an American public that's beaten down from this really serious issue,  a Gallup researcher tells the Times. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they're  completely  or  mostly  satisfied with the current health-care system based on their own experiences, though that number plunges to 39% when asked how well the system takes care of Americans in general. There's also a schism between Republicans and Democrats, with 67% of self-identified GOPers saying the US system is the best or one of the best in the world, while only 38% of Democrats say the same. However,  there is very little that separates the groups when it comes to the real-life consequences of the high cost of health care on their everyday lives,  Tim Lash, West Health's chief strategy officer, says in the release.  The time has come to take politics out of the equation and deal with the realities of the health care cost crisis with bipartisan and common-sense solutions that serve all Americans.",Health Care Costs Sent Americans Into $88B Debt in Last Year

The university quickly went on lockdown after the shooting was reported around 11:30am in a parking lot at the University Courtyard Apartments, which is on the edge of the Houston campus. Students and teachers were told to stay inside until the lockdown was lifted Friday afternoon, after two men were detained, but police said no charges have been filed. University President John Rudley said the student who was killed was a freshman, but that his name and age haven't been released. The second victim, whose name also hasn't been released, was shot twice and is hospitalized in stable condition, Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said. Silva said investigators were still searching for a motive, but that police weren't treating it as an  active shooter  investigation. The incident occurred just hours after another shooting near the same housing complex, though it's unclear whether the shootings were related. Classes were cancelled following the lockdown Friday. Rudley said classes will resume on a normal schedule Monday. The university said in a statement that an earlier shooting occurred early Friday morning, and that the school was increasing police presence on campus.

"(Dec 29, 2015  8:24 AM) Donald Trump has made a big to-do about spending next to nothing so far in his presidential campaign, but that may be changing. Sources in his camp tell Fox News he plans to kick off a major ad blitz, spending up to $2 million a week or more. This would mark a big change: Even though his campaign budgeted $25 million for TV ads for 2015's third quarter, Fox says it spent nothing—in Q3 or Q4. The first set of ads will reportedly jump right into where Trump stands on the issues, and they may also be reserved to swing back at rivals.  If you attack Trump, he will attack you 10 times as hard,  a Trump adviser tells Fox. The Hill notes Jeb Bush and John Kasich could be two targets, as they've gone on the offensive against Trump the most—for example, a Bush super PAC ponied up more than $3 million earlier this month for an ad aimed at Trump. And that's not the only big news in Donald's domain.

Although the details aren't yet clear, the site reports the RNC typically ensures that campaigns it list-shares with are well versed in data operations. The list-sharing agreement also stipulates that candidates pledge to support the eventual party nominee.

In fact, it is  quite possibly the first Apple-1 ever created,  says the site. With three days left, the top bid was $505,000 on Monday morning, but given the lineage of this one—and the fact that the last Apple-1 up for auction fetched $900,000—it won't be a big surprise if the million-dollar barrier is broken, notes CNET.

The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the fourth-quarter increase in the gross domestic product, the economy’s total output of goods and services, matched the 2.1% gain of the third quarter. Both quarters were well below the 3.1% surge seen in the first quarter.

Only one ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing, said Powerball spokeswoman Kelly Cripe. The winning Powerball numbers were 5-25-26-44-66 and the Powerball number was 9. Kripe said the exact location of where the winning ticket was sold was not immediately known and likely would be disclosed later Sunday by New Jersey Lottery officials.

"(Nov 16, 2015  5:50 PM) Rapid treatment is of utmost importance for babies diagnosed with infantile spasms, also known as West syndrome, a form of epilepsy that causes seizures and corresponding abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain. About half of the babies with it don't respond to the first drug that's tried, meaning doctors then use an injectable drug called Synacthen Depot, which one doctor says works 90% of the time. But Synacthen Depot is the latest drug to cause an uproar after a massive price hike, at least in Canada, CBC reports.  The price of Synacthen Depot increased by more than 2,000% from $33.05 per vial to $680 per vial,  says a spokesperson for Alberta Health, which delisted the drug in July. That means it won't be automatically paid for by Canada's government-subsidized health care anymore, TheStreet explains, though exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis. And as for the price, Fusion explains that the drug requires a six-week course, for a total cost of $14,280. Officials in other Canadian provinces saw a similar hike in the cost of the drug.  This was just dropped like a bombshell,  says a Toronto neurologist who is incensed by the price increase. Pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt owns the rights to the drug in Canada after acquiring another company last year, and a rep says the drug was losing money when the company acquired it.  They just bought it and jacked up the price,  says the neurologist. (When Canada tried to lower the price of another drug, it got sued by a US company.)","Latest 2,000% Drug Price Hike Hurts Infants"

The Hollywood Reporter guesses that scenes of a gay relationship were on the chopping block—and perhaps a sex scene involving Chinese actress Zhou Xun.  Chinese audiences might want to see more of a popcorn movie, and considerations for the Chinese market were made in the making of the Chinese version of the film,  says a producer, who notes that the edits were made in accordance with national censorship standards.

"(Apr 7, 2016  11:06 AM CDT) In a brazen assault near the Syrian capital, Islamic State militants on Thursday abducted 300 cement workers and contractors in an area northeast of Damascus, reports the AP, citing Syrian state TV reports. The mass abduction from the al-Badia Cement Company took place in Dumeir, an area where militants launched a surprise attack against government forces earlier this week. State-run news agency SANA quoted a source in the company as saying that there has been no success in efforts to establish contact with any of the workers. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syria conflict, said earlier in the day that contact was lost with the workers. No further details of the abduction were immediately known and there has been no claim of responsibility. Mass abductions have taken place on occasion in Syria during the country's devastating civil war, now in its sixth year, most often of religious minorities such as Christians. The abduction came as fighting with ISIS militants raged in northern Syria on Thursday. Syrian opposition fighters have advanced on strongholds of the group, including the ISIS-held town of al-Rai in northern Aleppo. Meanwhile, the UN special envoy for Syria said the next round of peace talks in Geneva was expected to start next week, around April 13.",Report: ISIS Kidnaps 300 Workers in Syria
"(Mar 28, 2018  8:16 AM CDT) Corey Feldman has said he wants to blow Hollywood open and expose the pedophilia that lies within, and he has also said he's been targeted for these allegations. Early Wednesday, a new development: a series of all-caps tweets from the actor showing him in what appears to be a medical facility, along with claims he was stabbed.  Im in the hospital! I was attacked 2nite!,  he posted. He added that three men had approached his car, which only he and his security were riding in, and one man yanked the door open, stabbing Feldman with  something.  TMZ notes he was stabbed in the stomach, though it's not clear if that's been confirmed. Feldman says he's now doing  OK.  The actor insists the alleged stabbing has something to do with his pedophilia accusations, tweeting:  I have had mounting threats on all SM platforms by this vile 'wolfpack' & this Im sure is a result of those negative actions! … How sick r these ppl?!?  He adds that the LAPD is looking into the incident as an attempted homicide, though Fox News reached out to the department for confirmation and hasn't heard back. Feldman also posted a link to his GoFundMe page for  security needs,  which has raised nearly $30,000 since it was started in November. Page Six notes the LAPD stopped looking into Feldman's sex abuse claims in November due to statute of limitations roadblocks, while Fox notes Feldman was cleared of a sexual battery charge in February.

"(Jun 7, 2017  1:00 PM CDT) A female peacock has ruffled more than just feathers at a Los Angeles-area liquor store. Without a peep, the peahen strutted into the open door of the Royal Oaks Liquor Store in Arcadia on Monday. Store manager and college senior Rani Ghanem said he didn't even know it was there until a customer walked in and asked him about  el pollo,  Spanish for  the chicken,  the AP reports. Ghanem, a 21-year-old San Bernardino resident whose family owns the store, said he then tried to guide the sharp-clawed bird outside but that she spooked, at one point flying directly toward him and then up onto a top shelf of the store. An animal-control officer responded after Ghanem called 911, approaching the peahen with gloves and a fishing net. That's when things got a little crazy.  He was trying to get it with the fishing net, and (the bird) jumped on the first wine bottle. When that happened, I was like, 'Aw, this is about to be a big mess,'  Ghanem said.  It just went straight diving into all the bottles. The more he kept on trying to use the net, the more it kept on flapping its wings and knocking everything over.  At one point, cellphone video taken by Ghanem shows the officer catching a wine bottle in the net as the bird crashes through a shelf and a dozen bottles shatter to the ground. Unable to watch more destruction, Ghanem puts on a sweatshirt to protect himself from the bird's claws and helps the officer ensnare it. He said they took the bird outside, unharmed. In all, Ghanem said the peahen was in the store for 90 minutes and broke $500 worth of the family store's best bottles.",Peacock Racks Up $500 Bill at Liquor Store
"(May 11, 2018  8:58 AM CDT) The subject of rent control has prompted some big headlines over the past few years, but one out of Manhattan will likely cause fellow city dwellers' jaws to drop. A New York Times obituary notes that in March, 84-year-old Patricia O'Grady was hit by a car near her Greenwich Village home and died of her injuries. Her apartment, however, is what's causing a buzz, after the New York Post reported the late actress was paying around what it costs for a week's worth of Starbucks lattes as monthly rent: $28.43, to be exact. Landlord Adam Pomerantz, who bought the apartment building in 2002, raised O'Grady's rent just once, from the $26.45 she was paying when he bought the building, after he consulted a rent-control worksheet. The apartment, which O'Grady moved into in 1955 with three other young actresses, could possibly be NYC's last cold-water flat, with no heat or hot water and with sparse updates—at her insistence.  What you're doing to me is torturing me. Please leave the apartment as is,  is what she reportedly told Pomerantz when he once tried to install a real heating system for her.  I didn't even know that [cold-water flats] existed anymore,  the head of the Metropolitan Council on Housing tells the Post in amazement.

"(Jul 23, 2015  2:53 AM CDT) There has been a steep rise in bison attacks on humans in Yellowstone National Park this year, which may be connected to a rise in visitors trying to take selfies or other close-up photos of the animals. The latest injured visitor—the fifth this year—is a 43-year-old woman from Mississippi who was charged by a bison Tuesday near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. She and her daughter turned their backs on the creature from roughly 6 yards away to get a photo with the bison in the background, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The National Park Service says the pair started to run when they heard the animal's footsteps, but it caught the woman and threw her in the air. The bison moved on after the woman's father came to her aid. Her family drove her to a clinic, where she was treated for minor injuries.  The family said they read the warnings in both the park literature and the signage, but saw other people close to the bison, so they thought it would be OK,  a ranger tells CNN.  People need to recognize that Yellowstone wildlife is wild, even though they seem docile. This woman was lucky that her injuries were not more severe.  The park, which tells visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from the animals, usually sees only one or two such incidents a year, and the rise in attacks could also be linked to a rise in visitor numbers, a spokeswoman tells the AP. Two of the other people attacked—a 62-year-old Australian visitor and a 16-year-old girl from Taiwan—were also trying to take bison photos.

What's more, the astronomers believe there are many, many more roaming free about the Milky Way, possibly twice the number of stars in the galaxy, reports Time. The new findings could shed more light on how planets form.  The implications of this discovery are profound,  writes a member of the Center for Astronomy in Germany in an accompanying Nature article. Scientists have long speculated that such rogue planets could exist, with one theory being that they got flung away from their own systems because of a too-close-encounter with another planet, explains Bloomberg. Astronomers used a process known as gravitational microlensing to detect the Jupiter-sized objects, and Space.com has more on how it works.","Astronomers Find 10 Rogue Planets That Don't Have Host Stars, Predict Lots More"

Matthew Allen, 18, was highly disoriented, partly blinded, covered in leeches, and suffering from gangrene when first responders winched him to an ambulance. Amazingly, Matthew was just 220 yards away from homes that were blocked from his view.

"(Oct 7, 2014  7:05 PM CDT) A British woman who was quite sure her cancer would kill her sooner rather than later decided to steal nearly $644,000 from her employer—but she ended up beating the disease and is now going to prison to serve a four-year sentence. Shirley Player, 61, stole about $92,000 a year between 2007 and 2014 from the real estate company she worked for to  settle debts, pay rents, and [buy] 'family treats,'  a prosecutor at her trial said in court—and it was all because  she had not expected to be still here,  the attorney added. One of Player's defense attorneys told the court that she was simply trying to plan ahead for her almost-certain demise, the Daily Express reports.  She told me she had wanted to do something for her family as she was not going to be here much longer,  he said.  I asked her where the money went. She does not know.  Player was said to have made 390 transactions into four separate accounts over the seven-year period, hiding them as  tenant deposit returns,  the Daily Mail notes. The theft was eventually discovered this year during a company audit. Player was also maybe relying too heavily on prescience: Even though she didn't have cancer when she started her stealing spree—she wasn't diagnosed until 2010—Player had had two sisters who succumbed to cancer and figured it was only a matter of time before she did, too. Even Player's husband, Malcolm, says he had no clue about the pilfered cash until the cops came calling.  We weren't driving around in Bentleys and drinking champagne,  he says.

"(Oct 25, 2011  7:40 AM CDT) It's one of astronomy's oldest mysteries—Chinese astronomers in AD 185 discovered a  guest star  that appeared in the sky for about eight months. Modern scientists have for decades believed it to be the first documented sighting of a supernova, but what kind of supernova was it? At long last, astronomers know. The ancient astral explosion was in fact a Type Ia supernova—a star about the same size as our sun that shriveled into a white dwarf, then emptied all the matter around it in space, siphoned off a nearby star, and exploded in an unusually large and rapid nova, reports Space.com. Now called RCW 86, the star once sat about 8,000 light years from Earth. Researchers used two NASA telescopes to measure the temperature of the exploded star's  guts  still in space—which would appear larger than a full moon if they were visible to the naked eye—and determined how much gas had to be in the star that created the supernova.  This supernova remnant got really big, really fast,  said the astronomer who led the study of the supernova.  It's two to three times bigger than we would expect for a supernova that was witnessed exploding nearly 2,000 years ago. Now, we've been able to finally pinpoint the cause.",NASA Solves 2K-Year-Old Mystery of China Star

The board gave Paladino 24 hours to resign over what it called  unambiguously racist  and  morally repugnant  remarks about the Obamas he made last week, reports the Huffington Post. Paladino, who unsuccessfully ran for governor as a Republican in 2010, told Buffalo weekly Artvoice that he wanted to see President Obama die of mad cow disease in 2017, and for Michelle Obama to  return to being a male  and live in a cave in Zimbabwe with a gorilla. The board said that if Paladino won't quit, it will petition New York Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia to remove him, the Buffalo News reports.

The impact on children of color, especially African-American children, is incalculable,  she said.  They would like me to tell you, 'You're fired.'  Other board members accused Paladino of racism and other misconduct going back many years. Paladino, who has said he won't step down, issued a statement accusing the board of trying to get rid of him for exposing corruption.

The raids targeted 57 mines with a history of violations, the Mine Safety and Health Administration said, including eight belonging to Massey Energy, the $4.17 billion company that owned the doomed West Virginia mine.  The purpose of these inspections is to provide assurance that no imminent dangers, explosions, hazards, or other serious health or safety conditions and practices are present at these mines,  the MSHA's director said.

The killings in the Tunisian resort of Sousse happened at about the same time as a bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and an attack on a US-owned factory in France that included a beheading. It was unclear if the violence was linked but it came days after the ISIS militants urged their followers  to make Ramadan a month of calamities for the nonbelievers.  In all, at least 63 people were killed. Sousse, some 90 miles from Tunis, is a popular resort for both Tunisians and Europeans. Gary Pine, a British tourist, describes his experience with today's attack to Sky News. He says he and his family were on the beach and thought fire crackers were being set off.  There was a mass exodus off the beach,  he says, noting that his son said he had seen someone get shot on the beach. Pine said guests at his hotel were first told to lock themselves in their rooms and later to gather in the lobby.

"(Aug 23, 2016  5:10 PM CDT) An explosion at a nuclear waste dump in New Mexico two years ago is now looking like what might be one of the most expensive cleanups in US history, the Los Angeles Times reports. Long-term damage was far greater than federal officials let on after a drum filled with radioactive waste blew up at the nation’s only underground dump near Carlsbad in February 2014, a Times investigation finds, and the bill could top $2 billion—rivaling the cleanup after nation’s worst nuclear accident at Three Mile island in 1979. And with the New Mexico dump still offline, thousands of tons of radioactive waste are sitting in other states, delaying processing and angering local officials.  There is no question the Energy Department has downplayed the significance of the accident,  Don Hancock of the watchdog group Southwest Research and Information Center, told the Times. Promises by the Energy Department to quickly reopen the dump, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, have led to  poor safety practices  during the cleanup, reports the Santa Fe New Mexican. The facility, which lies in salt caverns 2,000 feet below ground, was set to reopen in March, though the feds knew when they set that date they had a 1% chance of hitting it, an audit found. The dump is now set to reopen in December. Kitty litter was blamed for the blast, which blew the top off a drum filled with plutonium and americium waste. But that wasn't the only failing: Feds found some two dozen lapses at the dump, including the filtration system. As a result, some 35% of the ground area was contaminated and 21 workers exposed to low doses of radiation, per the Times.

The military argues that dropping below that threshold will leave it unable to protect any remaining US personnel, the New York Times reports. The State Department likes the 10,000 plan, but the military's all-or-nothing mentality has rankled Joe Biden and other key White House officials, who want to find a middle ground. Either way, troop levels may hit zero much sooner than anticipated. The plan calls for an accelerated exit that would bring the troops home by the end of Obama's second term, the Wall Street Journal reports. That would allow Obama to say he ended the long war, but Biden and Co. worry it's not enough time for the remaining troops to have an impact, and it's drastically sooner than the 2024 date negotiated with Hamid Karzai.

Now, the Harry Potter scribe is making a big move to fight the disease: She's donating $18.8 million for new facilities at a research center named after her mom, the AP reports. The Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic at Scotland's University of Edinburgh was launched in 2010 with a $12.3 million donation from JK Rowling, the BBC reports. It also conducts research into other neurological conditions, including motor neuron disease (MND), Parkinson's, and certain types of dementia.  When the Anne Rowling Clinic was first founded, none of us could have predicted the incredible progress that would be made in the field of regenerative neurology, with the clinic leading the charge,  Rowling says in a statement.  It's a matter of great pride for me that the clinic has combined these lofty ambitions with practical, on-the-ground support and care for people with MS, regardless of stage and type; I've heard ... firsthand what a difference this support can make. I am confident that the combination of clinical research and practical support delivered by professor Siddharthan Chandran and his exemplary team will create a definitive step-change for people with MS and associated conditions.","Rowling's Mom Died of MS at 45.

That's defined as one that covers workplaces, restaurants, and bars.  It is by no means a foregone conclusion,  but  I'm relatively bullish we'll at least get close to that number,  says a CDC official. Not one state had instituted a ban in 2000; by last year 25 had, notes AP. On top of that, 10 states have partial bans in place. Meanwhile, just seven states (Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming) have no rules against indoor smoking, though some of their cities do.  It's just a little bit more liberty slipping away at the hands of big government,  says a smoking advocate.

"(Aug 20, 2012  8:46 AM CDT) General Motors and Isuzu are recalling more than 258,000 SUVs after getting reports of 28 fires apparently caused by short-circuits in the cars' power windows and door locks. The recall covers many vehicle makes from the 2006 and 2007 model years, including the Chevy TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender, and Saab 97-X, the AP reports. Though there haven't been reports of injuries, the blazes have been fairly dramatic.  The fire burned the entire driver's side of the vehicle, a portion of the front passenger seat, and the roof,  explained one woman whose car caught fire in her driveway. The danger exists primarily in states that use salts and other chemicals to clear their roads of ice. Those chemicals can get inside the driver's door, corroding the circuits and ultimately causing them to short out and catch fire, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

"(Jan 14, 2017  11:37 AM) It's kind of like Netflix, but with Cadillacs instead of movies. The car company is experimenting with a modern twist on car ownership: Don't own at all and instead try out a new vehicle every month or close to it. In a press release, the company says it launching a  subscription  month-to-month car service it's calling BOOK. Those who participate can drive a new model for up to 60 days before turning it in, and they can max out at 18 different cars a year. It's not cheap, however, at $1,500 a month.  BOOK is aimed squarely at Gen X and Y customers who want the experience of a luxury vehicle without the hassles of traditional ownership,  a company executive tells Vocativ. BOOK debuts Feb. 1 in the New York City metro area, where car ownership rates are falling and people might want to take different members of a fleet out and about at their leisure without having to worry about selling it down the road, reports Quartz. Leasing a Cadillac costs much less—figure between $300 and $750—but with no mileage limits, and no handling of registration, taxes, maintenance, or insurance (though there is a $750 deductible in the event of an accident), the company is hoping the service paves the way for car subscriptions and finds success in other US markets, like Los Angeles.

In an ad to be published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Monday, Flynt notes that Williams settled a sexual harassment lawsuit out of court in 1998 and demands that Carson  disavow any and all relations  with him, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Flynt warns that if Carson doesn't fire Williams, the Hustler publisher will pay between $50,000 and $1 million for information on the  curious relationship  Williams had with Stephen Gregory, the personal trainer who sued him. Flynt's offer is the latest in a long line of his cash offers to expose alleged hypocrisy among conservatives, including a 2012 offer to pay for proof of  infidelity, sexual impropriety, or corruption  among members of Congress, and a 2011 offer of $1 million for anybody who could prove Rick Perry had an affair, the Reporter notes. There has been no response yet from Carson, who recently threatened to leave the Republican Party if GOP leaders resort to backroom deals to choose a nominee at a brokered convention.

"(Dec 9, 2009  7:31 AM) Taking a stand against the cut-rate $9.99 pricing in the fast-growing e-book market, two prominent publishers will start delaying release of e-books until four months after hardcovers come out.  The right place for the e-book is after the hardcover but before the paperback,  Simon & Schuster tells the Wall Street Journal, and Hachette is following suit. The Simon & Schuster move will affect 35 expected top sellers coming in early 2010, including Karl Rove's memoir Courage and Consequence and Don DeLillo's novel Point Omega. While publishers hope to keep hardcover sales—and prices—up, observers warn the step could backfire.

Even so, the Washington Post points out a jarring stat: A decade after a massive recall, Honda says 62,307 vehicles are still on the roads out there with the worst of the devices—known as  Alphas,  the driver-side bags have a 50-50 chance of exploding with shrapnel after just a fender bender.  Basically, people are driving around with ticking time bombs,  a mechanic tells WMUR. The reasons vary: In some cases, drivers may have ignored multiple notices to have their vehicles fixed. In others, cars may have changed hands several times over the years, making it difficult for the notice to reach the current driver. The Post, for instance, tells the story of a 26-year-old woman killed nearly four years ago while driving a 2001 Honda Civic that had been turned into a rental car.

They needed to come down,  says Mayor Catherine Pugh.  My concern is for the safety and security of our people. We moved as quickly as we could.  Overshadowing the move, of course, is the violence in Charlottesville, Va., that revolved around the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee. One of the statues that came down in Baltimore was of Lee with fellow Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. It had stood in a city park since 1948, notes the New York Times. Also coming down was a Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, another honoring Confederate women, and one in tribute to former Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 decreeing that even free blacks had no right to citizenship. Pugh said the city is still figuring out where the statues will end up. In North Carolina, meanwhile, a 22-year-old woman who helped topple a Confederate statue faces felony charges, reports the Herald Sun.

Now she's suing Tokyo's city government, which oversees the police, along with her agent and the attacker, for nearly $700,000.  I would like police to realize that if they fail to respond adequately, it could result in something similar to what happened to me,  she tells Asahi Shumbun. Police apparently shrugged it off when obsessed fan Tomohiro Iwazaki sent her more than 400 threatening tweets before the attack. Police also declined her request for protection two days before a concert in a Tokyo suburb. Attacked on her way there, Tomita was left partly blind in one eye with a list of health woes including PTSD and problems singing and eating.  When I see a person holding a pen, even if it is a friend or my doctor, I become really nervous because I fear I may be stabbed,  she says.  It is difficult to return to what life was like before the incident.  Iwazaki was sentenced to more than 14 years for the attack. But Tomita's assault is only one tragedy in a country where stalking is on the rise, CNN reports.

In the last hour, 122 bodies were discovered and it appears that two dozen died from sniper fire and the rest were summarily executed by gunshots from close range,  one activist told Reuters by telephone. The official state news agency said that Daraya has been  cleansed  of the  remnants of armed terrorist groups.  Anti-government groups claimed 440 people across Syria were killed by government forces yesterday, one of the highest single-day death tolls since the uprisings against Bashar al-Assad's government began in 2011. The majority of yesterday's killings were in the Damascus area, along with 40 in Aleppo and 28 in the heavily Sunni Deir al-Zor. In other news, a grim-faced Syrian Vice President Farouk Al-Sharaa was spotted in public for the first time in weeks today, reports the AP, ending speculation that he had defected.",Syrian Rebels Report New 200+ Massacre
"(Aug 12, 2013  3:31 PM CDT) Suspected Islamic militants wearing army fatigues gunned down 44 people praying at a mosque in northeast Nigeria, while another 12 civilians died in an apparently simultaneous attack nearby, security agents said today. The attacks were the latest in a slew of violence blamed on religious extremists in this West African oil producer, where the radical Boko Haram group, which wants to oust the government and impose Islamic law, poses the greatest security threat in years. It was not immediately clear why this particular mosque—located in Konduga town, some 22 miles outside Maiduguri, the capital of Nigeria's Borno state—was targeted, but Boko Haram has in the past attacked mosques whose clerics have spoken out against religious extremism. The group also has attacked Christians outside churches and teachers and schoolchildren, as well as government and military targets. The news came as journalists received a video featuring Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who gloats over recent attacks, threatens more, and even says his group is now strong enough to go after the United States.",44 Slain While Praying in Nigeria

"(Jun 24, 2013  10:39 AM CDT) Some $829 million in  improper payments,  including those involving fraud and clerical errors, went out to Pell grant recipients over the fiscal year that ended in September. Though that's a smaller figure than in the previous two years, it's up 86% from 2007—and the US is trying to root out the problem. Many applicants are applying for cash without planning to attend school at all; officials have flagged 126,000 questionable applicants since January, the Wall Street Journal reports. That's some 1% of aid applicants for the 2013-2014 academic year. Some of the fraud can be chalked up to organized crime, says the education department's inspector general: Last year, more than 34,000 in crime rings improperly got student cash. For the department, the biggest red flag is the receipt of aid for at least three schools in the same year. Officials tell schools about their concerns, and the schools seek further records from the applicant.  What we find are very poor students academically that are borrowing to the max, getting the maximum in their Pell grant and just going from school to school,  says a financial aid director at Maryland's Anne Arundel Community College.

"(Feb 24, 2014  7:00 PM) The FBI was created 43 years after Abraham Lincoln's death, and yet his assassin has ... an FBI file? Yep, a file was opened into John Wilkes Booth in 1922 and was still active as late as 1977, Smithsonian reports. The blog Wonders & Marvels got hold of the file, and shares some highlights. The file was started when a Missourian wrote bureau Director William J. Burns saying that Booth—rumored by some to still be alive—was either the man's neighbor or corresponding with his neighbor. Burns replied that he believed the  official records  and saw no need for further action. Yet another letter the following year prompted Burns to read a book about Booth's alleged escape, and Burns found that it had  very strong evidence in support of the old belief that Booth did escape and live many years.  (Still, there's no evidence of Burns following up on it.) In 1948, the FBI received the boot Booth wore when he killed Lincoln (a doctor removed it from his injured left leg), but an ultraviolet and infrared examination of writing in the boot couldn't make heads or tails of it. Finally, in 1977, the FBI scanned Booth's diary in search of invisible writing, and couldn't find any. The FBI did confirm what had been known since 1867, though: twenty-seven sheets were missing from it. The diary can still be seen at Ford's Theatre Museum.

"(Jul 25, 2012  9:16 AM CDT) William Staub, who took the treadmill—that ubiquitous piece of exercise equipment that is loved and loathed by millions—into homes and gyms, died Thursday at his Clifton, NJ, home. He was 96 and had been spied on a treadmill as recently as two months ago. Staub, a mechanical engineer, built and marketed his first treadmill in the late 1960s—40 steel rollers covered by an orange belt, a gray cover over the motor, and orange dials to determine time and speed. Staub envisioned it as a tool for people who wanted to run or walk outside but didn't because of inclement weather, less-than-ideal circumstances, or creative excuses, his son says. At the time, the treadmill was almost exclusively used by doctors, adds Dr. Kenneth Cooper, a health and fitness pioneer who used the machine to perform stress tests. Staub, who didn't exercise at the time, read Cooper's 1968 book Aerobics, which espoused the health benefits of exercise. The book mentioned a treadmill, and Staub wanted to develop it commercially so people could run indoors.  The treadmills we were using were very expensive, but there wasn't one on the market for the masses. And that's why he said, 'We need this,'  Cooper says.  I encouraged it. I said, 'If you can develop a treadmill that could be used in a home or an apartment it would be a slam dunk.' And it was.",Man You Can Blame for Your Dusty Treadmill Dead at 96
"(Jan 4, 2018  6:56 AM) A nasty crash hasn't kept Shaun White from dreaming up daring tricks as he eyes Olympic gold for a third time. The snowboarder, currently trying to qualify for the February games in Pyeongchang, needed 62 stitches after hitting his face off the edge of a half pipe during training in New Zealand in October. A video published Wednesday by Yahoo Sports shows the impact and blood-soaked snow before White is flown away in a helicopter with a bloodied face.  I scared myself,  White says later from a hospital bed.  I haven't really had that much blood coming out of me before.  Months later, White is back on his feet following surgery.  My health is great,  he told USA Today last month, adding his injuries were  definitely jarring more mentally than physically.   Having to wake up and look in the mirror and I have this big scar on my forehead and stuff, it's definitely not fun. It's a reminder,  he continued. But will White—who has twice won gold medals in half pipe—be able to compete at what could be his last Olympics? That could depend on upcoming qualifying events in Snowmass, Colo., and Mammoth Mountain, Calif., where White will be vying for a top-two finish. Riders usually need only a top-three finish to make the US team—something White has already achieved—but a deep American bench means  more riders are likely to do that than there are spots,  USA Today explains.

"(Jan 31, 2017  8:01 AM) President Trump's travel ban remains in place, but nearly 900 refugees are getting a reprieve. Per a Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters, the State Department and DHS have OKed 872 waivers for refugees who were already  in transit  when Trump's order left his desk Friday, leaving scores stuck at airports around the world. The document doesn't mention what countries the refugees originate from, but an anonymous DHS official confirms the waivers and says those who will benefit from them had already gone through the stringent US vetting procedure, which usually takes about two years. Trump's order put a stop to all refugee entry for 120 days (Syrian refugees indefinitely), and put tough limitations on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The point of temporarily suspending the refugee program here, per the most recent update to the DHS website, is to give DHS and  interagency partners  the chance to  review screening procedures.  Reuters notes that refugees fleeing to the US have often given everything up back home (homes, jobs, possessions), meaning it could be especially problematic to send them back to their originating countries. Per the DHS document, 348 visa holders were kept from getting onto US-bound planes over the weekend, while over 200 people made it into US airports but were then detained. Nearly 740 people were questioned by US Customs and Border Protection authorities at the airports—almost 400 of them being legal US green-card holders. The DHS official who spoke to Reuters says it's not clear if more waivers will be issued. (Here, stories of those stranded by the ban.)",872 Refugees Get Good News
"(Sep 5, 2018  6:21 AM CDT) British prosecutors charged two Russian men Wednesday with the nerve agent poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. The Crown Prosecution Service said the men, known to British investigators as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are charged in absentia with conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, and use of the nerve agent Novichok, reports the AP. Russian law forbids extradition of its own citizens, but Britain has issued a European Arrest Warrant, meaning the suspects can be detained if they leave Russia for another European country. Assistant police commissioner Neil Basu conceded it was  very very unlikely  police would be in a position to arrest them any time soon. Police say the men, both about 40, flew to London on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned March 4. Basu said they were probably using aliases. Basu appealed to the public  to come forward and tell us who they are.  Police released images of the men as they traveled through London and Salisbury between March 2 and March 4. Police say the two men flew back to Moscow from Heathrow on the evening of March 4, hours after the Skripals were found collapsed on a park bench. Police believe the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals was smuggled to Britain in a perfume bottle and applied to Skripal's front door of Sergei Skripal's house. The bottle was found by a local man, Charlie Rowley, in June; he was hospitalized and his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess, died. Police haven't determined where the bottle was between poisonings, and aren't ready to bring charges in the second poisoning. Basu wouldn't say whether cops believe the suspects worked for Russian security services but called it  a sophisticated attack across borders.",Brits Charge 2 Russians in Nerve Agent Poisoning

Duarte has been fighting legal battles since 2012, when he hired someone to plow 450 acres of land he had purchased near Red Bluff in central California, USA Today reports. Because the area included wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers ordered work to stop and sued Duarte for failing to obtain a permit and for allegedly carrying out  deep ripping  that went as far as 3 feet down, disturbing waters considered to be  waters of the United States  under federal regulations. A Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer says this is the first case he knows of where a farmer had to get a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to grow crops.  We're not going to produce much food under those kinds of regulations,  he says. Federal prosecutors say Duarte violated the Clean Water Act because his activities deposited dirt into wetland streams. The case is scheduled to go to trial in August, though Duarte says the Trump administration has made it clear it considers the rule involved to be  dead,  the Modesto Bee reports. He says unless the case is dropped, he will take it to the highest court possible to make sure other farmers aren't  shaken down by government agencies.

Archaeologists recently uncovered one of their 4,000-year-old homes in Lorain County and say it belonged to hunter-gatherers who visited periodically during the fall and winter, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.  There's nothing like this anywhere in Ohio,  says team leader Brian Redmond.  It's very significant. ... We have no idea what they called themselves or what language they spoke.

There are also cooking pits, storage holds for hickory nuts, and a shallow clay basin that captured Redmond's imagination. It was found with a primitive bone tool and deer anklebone inside, but  the purpose of this construction remains a mystery,  he writes in a blog.  Perhaps the basin held plant material. ...

"(Nov 30, 2012  7:06 AM) Although many Americans express anger at the seemingly ever-increasing amount they have to fork over to Uncle Sam, most actually paid a lesser amount in 2010 than they would have in 1980, according to an analysis by the New York Times that took into account federal, state, and local taxes. From 1980 to 2010 (the most recent available year), those earning more than $200,000 have enjoyed the largest decline in total taxes as a percentage of income, and 85% of households earning more than $25,000 per year have also seen the percentage of their income that goes to taxes drop. The group that got hit hardest? Those earning less than $25,000, only about half of which have seen their tax burden decline. While federal tax rates have been cut across the board since 1980, state and local taxes (which typically take a larger percentage of the lowest earners' income) have increased in most of the country, offsetting much of the federal savings—in six states, local tax increases have exceeded the decline in federal rates. Overall, about 31 cents of each dollar earned goes to the government, about the same as in 1980. However, changes to the tax code have seen the taxes paid by a household earning $350,000 fall to 42.1% from 49% (adjusted for inflation). While a household making $22,000 in 2010 paid a much lower percentage—19.4%—that's much closer to what it was for that household in 1980: 20.2%.","If It Was 1980, You'd Be Paying More in Taxes"

"(Apr 15, 2008  5:48 AM CDT) Britain's Ministry of Defense has agreed to pay $4 million in compensation to an Iraqi boy accidentally shot by a British soldier, the Guardian reports. The boy, now 17, is paralyzed from severe spinal injuries inflicted when the soldier dropped his rifle at a Basra base in 2003. He is receiving round-the-clock care in Britain and will never be able to return to Iraq. The payment is much higher than any awarded to any injured British soldier. The large amount is due to the level of negligence involved, said a government spokesman, who stressed that it was unlikely to set a precedent.

"(Aug 25, 2009  2:49 PM CDT) Minority participation in the SAT is up to 40% in 2009, the highest level ever, the Washington Post reports. That's up 2 points since last year and a whopping 10 points since 1999.  More than ever, the SAT reflects the diversity of students in our nation's classrooms,  says the president of the College Board, which crafts the test. Overall scores (out of 2,400) fell 1 point each in critical reading (501) and writing (493), while math remained the same (515). Though watchers applaud the diversity of the test-taking populace, some are still troubled by the inequality of scores between different racial and socioeconomic groups. For instance, students from families making more than $200,000 saw their scores improve an average of 26 points, while kids from $60,000 households held steady.

"(Jan 10, 2017  1:14 PM) If 22 years in prison seems harsh for stealing a TV remote control, Eric Bramwell probably agrees—but, based on his past criminal history, authorities in Illinois say it's a well-deserved sentence. Per the Chicago Tribune, the 35-year-old Melrose Park man was handed his fate on Wednesday by DuPage County Judge Robert Miller after being found guilty in November for stealing a remote from a Wheaton apartment complex's common area. But prosecutors say other burglaries of other remotes—and actual TV sets—he committed in six suburbs dating back to 2014 were what allowed for the extended sentence, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.  Mr. Bramwell's illegal activity and his history have finally caught up with him,  said State's Attorney Robert Berlin. What finally did Bramwell in: A glove was dropped during the August 1, 2015, remote disappearance, and the DNA from the glove matched with Bramwell's, whose records were in a database for convicted felons. At 17, Bramwell was nabbed by Franklin Park cops and admitted to being the  ringleader  in a series of home break-ins that netted him and his accomplices jewelry, power tools, and other items they could pawn. Bramwell—who received an additional six months in jail from Judge Miller in November for uttering profanities in court—will need to put in 11 years behind bars before he's up for parole.  Regardless of what was stolen, Mr. Bramwell repeatedly thumbed his nose at the law,  said Berlin.

While authorities aren't confirming the identify of the remains, Patty Wetterling and another source tell the Minneapolis Star Tribune the remains are those of Wetterling's son Jacob, who disappeared when he was 11.  Our hearts are broken,  Wetterling says.  We have no words.  The remains were found with information from Danny Heinrich, a 52-year-old man arrested last October on child pornography charges and a person of interest in Jacob's disappearance.  I am happy for them that they know, not that he’s passed, but at least they have closure,  Heinrich's brother tells KARE. Jacob was on the way back from the store with his friend and brother in 1989 when they were accosted by a masked man with a gun. The man had the other boys run into the woods and is believed to have kidnapped Jacob. Heinrich says he had nothing to do with Jacob's disappearance, but DNA evidence tied him to the sexual assault of another boy around the same time and place. The statute of limitations has passed on that crime, so no charges were filed, but Heinrich became a person of interest in Jacob's disappearance due to similarities in the incidents. In the wake of his disappearance, Jacob's family created the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center for families of lost children.

By August 18, due to a bank error that allowed him to withdraw unlimited amounts of cash, Page had withdrawn a whopping $1,543,104 that he didn't actually have—putting his account into serious overdraft, which finally clued the bank in to what was going on. Page, 55, now faces 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to theft of bank funds, ABC News reports. From February 2009 until August 2009, Page primarily used the account for gambling, depositing his winnings and withdrawing amounts as high as $50,000, but his average balance between December 2008 and May 2009 was just $100. Indeed, he was at Detroit's Greektown Casino when he first took advantage of the bank error, and most of his withdrawals were at casinos and cashiers in Detroit and Las Vegas.

"(Dec 14, 2011  12:36 PM) Roughly 2.5 million people between the ages of 19 and 25 have gained health insurance since President Obama signed his health care reform bill, more than double the 1 million the White House had been expecting, according to a new administration analysis. The bump is almost entirely due to a provision in a law that allows young people to remain on their parents' coverage until age 26. Before the law took effect, almost 36% of 19- to 25-year-olds lacked insurance, either because they couldn't find work that offered it to them, or they passed because they didn't think they'd need it. As of the second quarter, that had fallen to 27%. The bad news?

Oh, and they'll end up fatter than people 20 to 40 years ago even if they eat and exercise the same, according to a study in Obesity Research & Clinical Practice. The Atlantic reports that after looking at data from nearly 51,000 Americans, researchers concluded that a person in 2006 eating and exercising the same as someone of an identical age in 1988 had a BMI about 2.3 points higher, meaning they'd be about 10% heavier.  Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you'd have to eat even less and exercise more than those older to prevent gaining weight,  Jennifer Kuk of York University in Toronto says in the story. Researchers have three thoughts on why that could be, the Atlantic reports. First, we're exposed to more chemicals nowadays, which could be inducing weight gain. Second, prescription drug use is way up, and antidepressants especially have been linked to weight gain. Finally, hormones, antibiotics, or artificial sweeteners in meat and other foods could be changing the bacteria in our guts and hampering weight loss. Kuk says this research is a good reason to be more empathetic to people of all body types.  Ultimately, maintaining a healthy body weight is now more challenging than ever,  she says in a York press release.

"(Nov 8, 2018  6:33 PM) The UN’s Global Strategy for Plant Conservation program has set a 2020 deadline for conserving 75% of the world’s threatened plant species outside of their natural habitat. But, based on the results of a new study, the prospects of meeting that target aren’t very good. According to a paper published earlier this month in Nature Plants, 36% of  critically endangered  species produce recalcitrant seeds, meaning that they can’t survive being dried out. And that means that they aren't candidates for the traditional seed banking process, Phys.org reports. The study, performed by scientists affiliated with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also found that 35% of  vulnerable  species and 27% of  endangered  species generate seeds that cannot be banked using the common method of freezing them at about -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Among them are trees such as oak, avocado, cacao, and mango.  As successful as seed banking is for some species, it is not suitable for all seed plants and we need to invest in other ways to safeguard recalcitrant seeds,  says study co-author John Dickie, per Earth.com. One of those other ways to preserve recalcitrant seeds may be cryopreservation, which involves removing the embryo from a seed and freezing it at about -320 degrees Fahrenheit using liquid nitrogen. Per Phys.org, Kew has been using cryopreservation at its Millennium Seed Bank for years and is planning to develop a protocol to  kick-start large-scale use  of the method.

The New York Times paints a fascinating picture of a country that is no stranger to grisly murders and honor killings, but one in which capital punishment is an extremely rare occurrence, where even prison officials will sometimes help prisoners draft appeals. About 50 people have been hanged since 1947, the last in 2004. But after one prisoner’s last-chance appeal was rejected, the state of Assam found itself in need of an executioner. It looked to the state of Uttar Pradesh, which was known to have several hangmen. One had hanged one of the assassins of Indira Gandhi, but he died several years ago. Another had a broken arm. A third died May 19—but his son was interested in joining the family business. Officials promised to fast-track Pawan Kumar's application considering the need, but the Times notes that India is famous for bureaucratic delays and long lists of rules. Hanging is no exception: Even the length of the rope and construction of the gallows is regulated.

"(Sep 17, 2019  12:27 AM CDT) The first sexual experience for 1 in 16 US women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a new study suggests. The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn't use the word in asking women about forced sex. Almost 7% of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older, per the AP. Almost half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down, and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will. The results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. The new study is an analysis of responses from 13,310 adult women who participated in nationally representative US government health surveys from 2011-2017, before the Me Too movement.  Any sexual encounter (with penetration) that occurs against somebody's will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it's just as much rape,  says lead author Dr. Laura Hawks, a Harvard Medical School researcher. In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and reproductive health problems than women whose first sexual experience wasn't forced. Other studies have found long-term effects of sexual assault may include social isolation, feelings of powerlessness, stigmatization, poor self-image, and risky behavior, which all may increase risks for mental health problems, a journal editorial said.","For 7% of US Women, First Sex Experience Isn't Voluntary"

The vodka is made by Ogden's Own distillery in Utah, where state regulators have allowed it to go on sale. The ban is absurd and unfair, says an exec at Ogden's, who notes that a Utah beer named Polygamy Porter is sold in Idaho. Liquor board officials counter that Idaho doesn't control what brands of beer go on sale, adding that a glut of new liquor products also contributed to the board's nixing of Five Wives. The distillery is making the most of the ban with a media campaign and sale of  Free the Five Wives  T-shirts, notes the AP.",Idaho Bans 'Offensive' 5 Wives Vodka
"(Mar 19, 2015  4:28 PM CDT) In a survival story his doctors call extraordinary, a 22-month-old Pennsylvania boy whose lifeless body was pulled from an icy creek was revived after an hour and 41 minutes of CPR and has suffered virtually no lingering effects. Gardell Martin came home from the hospital on Sunday, and his doctors said today he has made a full recovery.  It's not only extraordinarily rare that we got the kid back, but what's even more extraordinary is the rate at which he recovered and the completeness of his recovery,  said Dr. Frank Maffei, director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Geisinger's Janet Weis Children's Hospital in Danville. Gardell and two of his brothers had gone outside to play on March 11 when he fell into the stream that runs through their 5-acre property near Mifflinburg. A neighbor found Gardell nearly a quarter-mile away, caught up in a tree branch and water gushing around him. An ambulance crew arrived moments later, found no pulse, and began CPR. Resuscitation would continue, unbroken, for 101 minutes—in the ambulance, at a community hospital, aboard a medical helicopter and, finally, in the emergency room of Janet Weis. Gardell's body temperature was 77 degrees when he arrived, more than 20 degrees below normal. In this case, the boy's hypothermia worked to his advantage, slowing his metabolism and giving his organs  some degree of protection from cardiac arrest,  Maffei said. Knowing that, Maffei ordered CPR to continue while the team warmed his body. At around 82 degrees, they detected a pulse.","Toddler OK After Icy Plunge, 101 Minutes of CPR"
"(Oct 14, 2015  11:18 AM CDT) In 2010, Randy Guijarro bought three old photographs he liked at a junk store in Fresno, Calif., for $2, including a 4-by-5-inch  tintype  showing a bunch of men playing croquet near a cabin in 1878. But not just any men—nearly a year of authentication proved that the photo shows Billy the Kid and members of his gang of outlaws, The Regulators, and now the picture (which, the Sacramento Bee notes, actually cost Guijarro only 88 cents) is going to auction and could sell for $5 million, USA Today reports.  When we first saw the photograph, we were understandably skeptical—an original Billy the Kid photo is the Holy Grail of Western Americana,  says the senior numismatist at Kagin's, the firm of experts that authenticated the tintype and will negotiate its sale. There's only one other known photo of Billy the Kid, taken in 1880, and that 2-by-3-inch tintype sold for $2.3 million in 2010. The process of authenticating the newly discovered picture of Billy (real name William Henry McCarty Jr. , though he also used the alias William H. Bonney) will be explored on a National Geographic special Sunday. It all started after Guijarro enlarged the image he'd bought and thought he recognized Billy the Kid and his best friends, Tom O'Folliard and Charlie Bowdre. Sallie Chisum is in the picture, too, ABC30 reports, and Fox News notes that research of her writings revealed the photo was taken after Bowdre's wedding.  We had to be certain that we could answer and verify where, when, how, and why this photograph was taken,  the numismatist says. Experts in digital facial recognition, antique photography, geographic positioning, and even vintage croquet sets were brought in and will be featured on the documentary.

"(Oct 27, 2010  7:08 AM CDT) Charlie Sheen’s latest escapade is even grosser than originally reported: Turns out the Two and a Half Men star was allegedly doing cocaine and hanging out with a hooker before going on a hotel-trashing rampage that ended up costing him $7,000 in damages. When police found him, Sheen  was getting in everyone's face, frothing, paranoid,  a source tells the New York Daily News. His room was spattered with blood and broken chandelier glass, and the prostitute was reportedly also found naked, hiding in the closet. Sheen admitted using cocaine, sources say, and Radar reports he also tested positive for the drug. While the Daily News describes his companion as a  semipro  celebrity gold digger, Radar claims she’s definitely a prostitute—and that she’s the person Sheen accused of stealing his wallet during his meltdown. Of course, the official line from a rep for the actor blames all this on  an adverse allergic reaction to some medication.

"(Jul 27, 2020  6:33 AM CDT) Senate Republicans are set to release a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package on Monday, and with that deal, Americans can expect checks similar to the ones sent out in the last round.  There's a $1,200 check coming,  White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, per CNBC, adding,  It's a very well-rounded package.  Also included in this bill, which comes after a $3 trillion package proposed in May by House Democrats was rejected by the GOP-controlled Senate: an extension on the federal eviction moratorium, an extension on unemployment benefits, funding for school reopenings, and liability protections for businesses. There are still bones of contention, however. For example, although Democrats have sought to keep the $600-per-week addition to unemployment checks going, Republicans say it's too much and keeps people at home instead of working; their proposal calls for a 70% replacement of lost wages instead. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says that would cut the extra unemployment check down to about $200 per week, Vox notes. As for the eviction moratorium, critics point out it applies only to renters in buildings with government-backed mortgages, per USA Today, which cites Aspen Institute stats showing 20% of Americans living in rental households face eviction by the end of September.

Jay Darshane says he was  trying to help the police with their investigation  when officers showed up right after the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting at his restaurant, which WGN notes is located about 50 yards from where the fatal shots were fired. Darshane says the BK's assistant district manager called him that night to tell him there were  four or five  officers asking to review the eatery's surveillance video. Darshane gave the OK, and cops holed up with the tape for nearly two hours, he says—but when they left, there was an  inexplicable 86-minute gap,  from 9:13pm to 10:39pm, that included when Laquan was shot, the Tribune notes.  I didn't know they were going to delete it,  Darshane says, adding that he testified about the missing video earlier this year in front of a grand jury. But State's Attorney Anita Alvarez has said there's no forensic evidence to back up claims the tape was erased on purpose, and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy says those claims are  absolutely untrue  and that there were  apparently technical difficulties.  The Tribune notes that the surveillance camera probably wouldn't have had the vantage point to show Laquan's shooting, but it may have depicted some of the teen's movements right before. And an attorney for Laquan's family poses a question.  It is curious,  he says.  If [the officers] got there and turned it on and found that there was no video, what were they looking at for two hours?

Three large monasteries are empty near Lhasa, where hundreds of monks and supporters held protests amid gunfire in March. The government is holding the monks—many of them young ethnic Tibetans—in nearby prisons and detention centers, according to sources. The government reportedly plans to free the monks after the Games end.  They have been told they will be allowed to leave because they are not guilty of a crime,  said one monk's brother. But they are expected to be ordered to return to their villages and not the monasteries, which means the monasteries could lose some of their best scholars.","1,000 Tibetan Monks Jailed to Prevent Protests"

The Massachusetts woman, who met Christopher Castillo on a dating app before picking him up at his parents' house on Dec. 5, 2016, didn't think much of his request to stop at a bank once they got to her hometown of Attleboro Falls, even after he'd downed wine in the passenger seat in the middle of the afternoon. That is, until he came sprinting back to the car with a .44 caliber gun and $1,000 in cash and told her to  f---ing go,  per CNN and the Washington Post. Panicking, the 40-year-old driver took off but pulled over once officers began tailing them. She was initially charged with being an accessory after the fact, per the Attleboro Sun Chronicle. She was held on $250,000 bail before the charges were dropped, leaving her with the ultimate bad date story. But the trouble was just starting for Castillo, who'd showed his stepfather's antique gun to a teller at Bristol County Savings Bank, complaining that he was  really hurting,  per the Post.

He wasn't breathing when Neuman awoke early on Dec. 29, and paramedics were unable to revive him, the Detroit News reports. The Wayne County Medical Examiner ruled the baby had become  wedged  between the bed and the wall, and died of accidental asphyxiation as a result of  bed sharing.  Neuman was arraigned on Monday on charges of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree child abuse. Last year, Neuman had been warned in a class for new mothers about the dangers of  co-sleeping,  People reports. Neuman was enrolled in the class run by Child Protective Services after a tipster told authorities it looked like she was going through drug withdrawal. Neuman's lawyer, Maggie Cotant, acknowledges that her client sought help at a drug and alcohol treatment center while pregnant, but says it played no role in the death. She says Neuman put Connor in her bed because he had a cold and she feared not hearing him if he cried.  This is a person who has been punished enough,  she says. A report found that suffocation was the most common cause of sleep-related deaths in Wayne County in recent years, per Michigan Live. In 2013, prosecutors warned that parents would face criminal charges if they place their children in  unsafe sleeping environments.

"(Dec 22, 2009  7:44 AM) Michael Steele’s been lining his own pockets with speaking fees of up to $20,000, capitalizing on his RNC chairmanship in a way past chairmen haven’t—and those past chairmen don’t approve.  Holy mackerel, I never heard of a chairman of either party ever taking money for speeches,  Regan-era RNC chair Frank Fahrenkopf tells the Washington Times.  The job of a national chairman is to give speeches. That’s what the national party pays him for.  The committee pays Steele $223,500, and it’s a full-time job says, another former RNC chair.  You can work 24/7 and not get everything done, so taking time out to speak for the benefit of one's own bank account is not appropriate,  he said. But an RNC spokesman says the controversy is  silly,  because Steele  has been giving inspirational speeches based on his personal story long before he was elected RNC chairman.",Steele Slammed for $20K Speaking Fees
"(Nov 19, 2015  1:48 PM) The House overwhelmingly approved legislation Thursday to make it harder for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the United States. The AP calls the 289-137 vote a  stinging rebuke  to President Obama, and the Hill points out that 47 Democrats bucked the White House and supported the measure. It now moves on to the Senate, where its fate is unclear. Senators won't take up the matter until after the Thanksgiving recess, and Obama has promised a veto if it reaches his desk. Politico notes that the 289 votes in favor is enough to override the veto in the House, adding that the vote shows Republicans plan to emphasize foreign policy in the 2016 election. The measure, which in effect would suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, would require the FBI to conduct background checks on people coming to the US from those countries. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee  is not a threat to the security of the United States.  The White House has called that requirement  untenable,  reports the New York Times, which describes the new procedures as  difficult to implement.",47 Democrats Buck Obama on Syrian Refugees
"(May 22, 2017  10:53 AM CDT) The Supreme Court struck down two North Carolina congressional districts Monday because race played too large a role in their creation, reports the AP. The justices ruled that Republicans who controlled the state legislature and governor's office in 2011 placed too many African-Americans in the districts, weakening African-American voting strength elsewhere. Both districts have since been redrawn, but even so Republicans maintained a 10-3 edge in congressional seats in 2016. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said the state did not offer compelling justification for its reliance on race in either district. The issue of race and redistricting one is a familiar one at the Supreme Court, and Kagan noted that one of the districts was  making its fifth(!) appearance before this court.  The court unanimously affirmed a lower court ruling on District 1 in northeastern North Carolina. Kagan wrote that the court will not  approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence.  The justices split 5-3 on District 12 in the state's southwest. The state argued that Republicans who controlled redistricting wanted to leave the district in Democratic hands, so surrounding districts would be safer for Republicans.  The evidence offered ... adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration,  Kagan wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the four liberal justices. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy dissented.  Partisan gerrymandering is always unsavory, but that is not the issue here,  Alito wrote, per USA Today.  The issue is whether District 12 was drawn predominantly because of race. The record shows that it was not.  Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part.",Supreme Court Strikes Down 2 GOP-Drawn NC Districts
"(Dec 21, 2011  7:01 AM) The predictions are getting worse: Japanese officials today said that it could take as many as 40 years to decommission the Fukushima nuclear plant, upping the previous estimate of 30 years. According to the detailed roadmap, TEPCO intends to spend the next two years clearing the spent fuel rods out of the storage pools situated in the reactor buildings; but the lion's share of the time will go to removing the melted nuclear fuel. That process will take some 25 years, and will necessitate the use of robots—and technologies that haven't even been invented yet, reports the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal zeroes in on one of the toughest steps in the process: Figuring out how to drain thousands of tons of irradiated water from the reactor buildings' basements. The cracks that the earthquake created in these buildings will then be repaired, allowing the reactors to be refilled with water, which must occur before the melted fuel can be removed from them. Once that process is complete, it'll be another five to 10 years until the reactors are completely decommissioned.",Japan: 40 Years to Fully Shut Down Fukushima

Given the success, I've approved the deployment of up to 250 additional US personnel in Syria, including special forces to keep up this momentum,  Obama said from Germany at the tail end of an overseas tour.  They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces as they continue to drive [ISIS] back.  The city of Raqqa has become one of the extremist group's strongholds, and the newly pledged troops will bring the total number of US soldiers up to 300. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said before Obama's announcement that even though these new troops would be in  harm's way,  they're technically not being sent on a combat mission, ABC News notes. Obama also implored others to step up their game in combating the militants.  Even as European countries make important contributions against (ISIS,) Europe, including NATO, can still do more,  he said.

Matthew Rader was in his mom's kitchen Wednesday when he got on top of the stove, found a container of ground cinnamon, and decided to have a taste.  He started choking. It was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed,  Brianna Rader tells WLEX. He was pronounced dead of asphyxiation at a hospital 90 minutes later. A coroner, who says cinnamon asphyxiation is surprisingly common, adds some of the powder made its way into Matthew's lungs. His funeral will be today, per an obituary. But it  helps ease my breaking heart just a little to think that just maybe my baby's story can save even just one child's life,  Rader writes on Facebook. Though this was no cinnamon challenge, Rader says her son's death should be a caution to those attempting to swallow a dry spoonful of cinnamon powder.  Cinnamon can kill,  Rader says.

The Des Moines Register reports on the recent passing of 5-year-old Garrett Matthias, who died July 6 after a nearly yearlong battle with a rare, aggressive cancer. Over the past few months, Garrett and his parents had some frank discussions about death, and at one point Garrett noted,  Why are funerals so sad? I'm going to have bouncy houses at mine.  An idea was born, and together the family started planning Garrett's send-off when his cancer was declared terminal in June. That included writing Garrett's obituary, which he helped his parents with by answering queries you might see on an  about you  questionnaire. The now-viral obituary details his favorite superheroes—including, of course, Thor—things he loves (playing with his sister, thrash metal) and hates ( dirty stupid cancer ), and what he would have wanted to be as an adult: a pro boxer. It also lays out what he intended to do once he died.  I am going to be a gorilla and throw poo at Daddy!  he notes, adding he wanted to be  made into a tree so I can live in it when I'm a gorilla.

The magazine made its announcement on the Today show. Thunberg, 16, beat out other finalists that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Trump, the Hong Kong protesters, and the whistleblower who triggered the Ukraine scandal that has led to Trump's impeachment. The teen's protests against global warming started out as a solo venture in 2018, when she started skipping school on Fridays to sit outside Sweden's parliament building with a sign that read  School Strike for Climate.  She was soon joined by other students in her hometown, and then across Europe, kicking off what became known as the Fridays for Future movement. She's had quite a journey since. In the nearly year and a half since her first August 2018 protest, Thunberg has  addressed heads of state at the UN, met with the pope, sparred with the president of the United States, and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on Sept. 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history,  per Time. Thunberg has also been candid about having Asperger's syndrome, which she calls  a superpower.

The girl was in serious condition and her 44-year-old aunt was in guarded condition, while the bike rider, 32-year-old Caliph Douglass, suffered a collapsed lung and a spinal injury. He was arraigned from his hospital bed Sunday on charges including vehicular aggravated assault, auto theft, and reckless endangerment, reports NBC Philadelphia. Douglass has a lengthy criminal record, including attempted murder charges, and his bail has been set at $1 million.

The  majority of Democratic voters,  on the other hand, have grown more populist and want less Wall Street power. The icon for that latter group: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who continues to make a name for herself battling big banks. And therein lies the rub for Hillary Clinton, who may find it difficult to extricate herself from Wall Street ties, writes Noam Scheiber in the New Republic.

And third, she can  awaken in Democratic voters an almost evangelical passion.  Some criticize her for apparently focusing on her image, but it's not that she wants stardom: She's just  relentlessly, perhaps ruthlessly, maybe even a bit messianically, focused on advancing her policy agenda,  Scheiber notes.

That's because their coastal village, located some 480 miles west of Anchorage, is in the process of being washed into the Bering Sea. As the Guardian explains in an in-depth look at the town, the Ninglick River flows past three of Newtok's sides on its path to the sea, and it's been chipping away at the village at a rate that's only grown more aggressive due to climate change (more than 100 feet of shoreline gone some years), which has been linked to melting permafrost and dwindling protective sea ice. The US Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the village, and offered no break to the gloom: It concluded that seawalls or other protective measures wouldn't work, and that Newtok's highest point could be underwater in just four years, by 2017. The villagers must leave (a tribal administrator tells Alaska Public Radio relocation has been a major town talking point for the last three decades), leading the Guardian to dub them  America's first climate change refugees.  The villagers selected a new site nine miles away, but moving the town there could cost $130 million, and relocation efforts have yet to truly get off the ground.

Someone handed Jaffe the sole survivor—13-month-old Christina Rivera, whose mother and two siblings were among the victims—and pictures of the pair appeared on newsstands the next morning. From that point on, Jaffe remained a fixture in Rivera's life—and last year Jaffe adopted Rivera, now 31, reports the New York Times, which is telling their story for the first time.  I was assigned to her and fell in love with her,  says Jaffe, who initially asked to take Rivera home after watching over her at the hospital and a police station 30 years ago Tuesday. Instead, Rivera was reunited with her father and ended up living with her grandmother, but Jaffe visited frequently, playing with Rivera and often bringing gifts and money. As Rivera got older and learned about her mother and siblings' deaths, Jaffe was there to answer her questions and support her, and Rivera eventually started thinking of Jaffe as her mother. She went on trips with Jaffe and her then-fiance, and when Rivera was 14, she moved in with them for about a year. After moving out to live with her father, she remained close with her surrogate parents, who eventually helped send her to college. Rivera eventually got a job with the state and is also an auxiliary police officer, and last year, after her grandmother died, Jaffe made good on a longstanding promise to adopt her.

Among the reported dead today was a 15-year-old boy, CNN reports, though Israel said it did not bomb the area where he was killed. For its part, Israel says its attacks  destroyed launching pits  for Iranian-built rockets. Some 31 more rockets were launched from Gaza today, bringing the total to more than 200, according to the Jerusalem Post.",Middle East Quartet Meets as Gaza Toll Hits 23

The field trip will include visits to production and engineering facilities and a meeting with the United Auto Workers. The auto team, which collectively has no past experience in the industry, faces a March 31 deadline to consider reorganization plans submitted by GM and Chrysler.

"(Dec 19, 2019  11:22 AM) Two more 16th-century anchors have been found at the spot where conquistador Hernan Cortes is believed to have scuttled his ships, experts said Monday. Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said that while the anchors can't be positively IDed as belonging to Cortes' fleet, they appear to match the time period, the AP reports. Another Spanish expedition came to the area just after Cortes, so the anchors could have been from those ships. An anchor previously found in 2018 still had its wood crosspiece, and the wood has been dated to between 1450 and 1530. The wood was IDed as a type of oak that grows in northern Spain. Neither of the two anchors found this year still had wood, but the anchor design appeared to be from the same period. The institute said the two anchors were found by divers in the Gulf of Mexico near the town of Antigua. Veracruz.",Mexico May Have Found 2 More of Conquistador's Anchors
"(Oct 26, 2017  7:37 AM CDT) Five women accuse journalist Mark Halperin of sexual harassment in a new report from CNN. The women, who shared their stories on condition of anonymity, describe varying offenses—including forcible kissing, groping, and being propositioned for sex—while 52-year-old Halperin was political director at ABC News a decade ago. Three of the women also say Halperin pressed up against them with an erection while clothed. Halperin, now an NBC News analyst, denies that claim in a statement, but admits  I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me.  He says,  I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.  In its own statement, NBC News calls the allegations  very troubling  and says Halperin will be removed as contributor  until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.  Meanwhile, ABC News notes  no complaints were filed  against Halperin before his departure from ABC in 2007. One of the women who spoke to CNN, however, says she told her mentor at ABC when Halperin forcibly kissed her, grabbed her breasts, and pressed his penis against her in his office. The mentor told her he wanted to notify management, the woman says, though it isn't clear if he ever did. Other accusers say they feared retribution if they spoke out, given Halperin's authority at ABC and in political journalism more broadly. Some still fear retribution, per CNN.",5 Women Say Mark Halperin Harassed Them
"(Jul 22, 2010  9:22 AM CDT) The X-Prize competition for fuel-efficient cars is, as you might expect, dominated by hybrids and electric cars. So the Edison2 Very Light Car stands out. It’s a four-door sedan—the last such car remaining in the competition—and it runs on good old-fashioned gasoline, NPR reports. Developed by a retired racecar driver, the car weighs just over 700 pounds, making it so light that it should be able to hit the prize’s 100mpg-or-better target.  With racing, it’s all about pushing performance to the absolute,  says one of the racing veterans working on the car.  With the other automakers, they've become so stuck because the cars that they're producing next year rely on parts that were used this year.  And yes, he says, the car should be safe to cruise the highway with, because it incorporates the same features that allow so many race car drivers to walk away from crashes.","Very Light, Gas-Powered Car Gets 100mpg"

Add Kidney Disease for 9/11 Rescue Workers!  the signs outside MetLife Stadium and the Holland Tunnel and on NYC buses read, referring to the illness 44-year-old Mike Megna says he came down with due to dust at the decimated World Trade Center, where he toiled for three weeks after the attacks. Megna started seeing smaller symptoms, like a constantly runny nose and digestive issues, early on, but in 2006 blood began showing in his urine, and a diagnosis delivered heart-sinking news: He had a  super-rare  form of kidney disease that only 20 people in the world have. And while Megna, who's been disabled since 2011, has applied for compensation cash from the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act of 2010, there's a complication: Kidney disease isn't one of the recognized illnesses covered by the fund. That means the divorced dad of three isn't eligible for any money—even though Mary Ann McLaughlin, a Mount Sinai Medical Center researcher who petitioned the fund two years ago to add the disease based on initial research, has examined Megna's records and believes the WTC toxins  may more likely than not  be tied to his sickness. However, a rep for the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which runs the program, says a disease can be added to the list—and compensation issued—only after  published, peer-reviewed epidemiologic evidence  shows  substantial support  for a direct link between the WTC fallout and the disease. Megna will have to hold tight, per the rep, who says once McLaughlin publishes her study, kidney disease eligibility will be considered. But that's time Megna—$120,000 behind on his mortgage and anticipating dialysis down the road (his kidneys are now functioning at 45%, per the Star-Ledger)—says he doesn't have.

Drew Faust said cost savings would be in order, though specific plans aren’t settled, the Harvard Crimson reports. One thing that won’t be affected, she said, is the university’s financial aid policy, which includes a commitment to eliminate tuition for families who earn less than $60,000.

That company is smartphone maker Huawei; the others are Lenovo, Oppo, and TCL, and the deals they have with Facebook date to 2010 and are still active, though the Huawei one won't be by week's end. Facebook itself was the source for this latest Times' story, and it explains that the companies' deal was akin to BlackBerry's, meaning they had access to information on a user's friends without their consent. That data allowed Huawei to power an app that rounded up social media and other messages in one location. Facebook says the data was stored on the device, not on Chinese servers. A rep for Huawei tells the AP the company  worked with Facebook  but  has never collected or stored any Facebook user data.  Per Axios, lawmakers are wringing their hands over the report, and Mike Allen explains what DC and Facebook just don't  get : Politicians don't understand these partnerships  were pretty standard at the time ... nor were they a secret.

Hinton had just eaten Thanksgiving dinner with his family when the 28-year-old went home with his nephews and little sister, according to his aunt, Lynette Johnson. She says the family was still together when they heard news of his death.  It was devastating,  says Johnson.  It doesn’t seem real. In the blink of eye you’re gone. He was a beautiful person.

In his lawsuit, Hinton said a captain and five guards shackled and beat him, fracturing a vertebra and breaking his nose; all six were later fired for the attack. Hinton apparently hoped for a new start with the payout, but his mom, Parys Johnson, tells the Daily News that he  felt like something was going to happen to him.  She says her son was likely  set up  by people who believed he already had the settlement money. Hinton has a pregnant girlfriend, but it's unclear who, if anyone, will receive the money.

One woman tells the Huff Post that in 2007, during Franken's first Senate campaign, he grabbed her buttocks during a photo-op after she sang with a feminist choir at a Women’s Political Caucus event in Minneapolis that Franken attended with his wife. She says her story is  eerily similar to that of Lindsay Menz, who says Franken groped her in 2010.

Another woman tells the Huff Post that she was disgusted and disappointed after Franken put his arm around her waist and  cupped her butt  during a Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis in 2008.

Born in 1928, Temple soared to fame in the 1930s; she was three when she appeared in her first film, the BBC notes. At six, she won a special kids' Oscar, making her the youngest ever to receive an Academy Award—a distinction she still holds. Temple appeared in 46 films and  one-reelers  before she was 13, the Hollywood Reporter notes, and she was America's biggest box-office draw for four consecutive years, outpacing even Clark Gable.

Today, in a sign of just how fast the crisis is escalating, it made a formal request to Congress for nearly twice that amount, reports the Washington Post. The $3.7 billion would be divvied up among various agencies with a two-pronged goal: to speed up the deportation process while making sure that the kids get adequate health care in detention centers in the interim. Among other things, the money would be used to send more immigration judges to the border, build more holding centers, and beef up border-security patrols.

Rezaian; former US Marine Amir Hekmati; pastor Saeed Abedini; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose name had not been previously made public, were to be flown from Iran to Switzerland aboard a Swiss aircraft and then transported to a US military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, for medical treatment. The student, identified as Matthew Trevithick, was released independently of the exchange on Saturday and already was on his way home, said US officials. In return, the US will pardon or drop charges against seven Iranians—six of whom are dual US-Iranian citizens—accused or convicted of violating US sanctions. The deal comes ahead of the expected implementation of the landmark deal on Iran's nuclear weapons. Rezaian was born in California and holds both US and Iranian citizenship. He was convicted in closed proceedings last year after being charged with espionage and related allegations. The Post, for which he covered Iran, and the US government have denied the accusations, as has Rezaian. Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran in 2007 while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence mission, wasn't part of the deal. American officials are unsure if the former FBI agent is even still alive. The Iranians have always denied knowing his location.",Iran: 4 US Citizens Freed

"(Aug 19, 2013  7:30 AM CDT) A 22-year-old man who was struck by an Amtrak train going 110mph on Friday somehow survived with just some broken bones, and was already out of the ICU yesterday, WSBT reports. Darryle See told police he was walking on the tracks with headphones on, listening to music, east of Michigan City, Indiana. The conductor blared the train's horn more than once and applied the brakes, but See was hit and thrown 20 feet; one of his shoes came off and landed 150 feet away.  The conductor said it was a straight-on hit,  says an officer. See  says he doesn't remember anything until he woke up on the other side of the tracks,  says his grandmother, with whom See lives. But by the time police arrived, See  was conscious and alert, sitting up and talking to us. I never would have guessed he was the victim,  the officer tells the Northwest Indiana Times; he speculates that the angled front of the train may have deflected some of the force and saved See's life:  It could have been an angle that threw him off to the side,  he tells the Herald Argus. See's grandma says he has  one or two  pelvis fractures and neck injuries; he may also have broken an arm, and he was scheduled to have surgery yesterday.

"(Jun 25, 2018  8:41 AM CDT) Only 28,000 of the planet's 7 billion people are eligible to take the cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi. And yet that tiny population enabled drugmaker Vertex to make roughly $1.3 billion in sales off the product. How does that math work out? The annual price of the drug is $272,000 a year, a figure perhaps even more eye-popping when the drug's effectiveness is factored in. In a piece that focuses on how New York state is using a new law to push back against that sticker price, the New York Times explains the drug's positioning: 2012 saw the approval of the first drug that tries  to counteract the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis.  But Kalydeco can only be used by a small subset of patients with a specific genetic mutation. When Orkambi followed in 2015, it was hailed for its ability to treat nearly 1 of every 2 patients—except it's not as effective. Medicaid must cover almost all FDA-approved drugs; per federal law, state programs get a minimum 23% rebate. The Times explains New York last year passed a law that enables it to ask pharma companies for a price break if the state's drug budget passes a certain threshold. New York in April determined Orkambi was one of 30 drugs whose cost effectiveness was out of whack. It sought price cuts, specifically one of about 70% off the list price for Orkambi. State officials say Vertex was the only drugmaker who didn't play ball. A rep for Vertex backs that up, saying the company plans to stick with the 23% discount it is required to pay.

Sorry, but there's really nothing you can do to improve your odds … which are about one in 176 million, ABC News reports. Since the pool of numbers never changes (the first five winning balls come from a set that runs 1 to 56; the last one can be any number from 1 to 46),  your chances of winning the jackpot with Mega Millions will always be the same,  says one gaming mathematician, who has not purchased a ticket in 25 years.  It doesn't matter what numbers you pick or the jackpot size.  Of course, that doesn't stop people from coming up with strategies in an attempt to win big with tomorrow's drawing; one programmer created a website to track the numbers that have been drawn, and says some definitely pop up more than others. Even so, he says,  if that kind of analysis truly did produce a winning result, I would be a millionaire by now.  One interesting suggestion: Avoid picking the same numbers as other people. That means you may want to consider taking random numbers rather than choosing your own, since people tend to choose dates—and, since that excludes a fair portion of the number pool, date-pickers are more likely to have to share the winnings.","No, You're Not Going to Win Mega Millions $500M Jackpot"

"(Dec 14, 2010  9:07 AM) Retail sales rose for a fifth straight month in November, as the biggest jump in department store sales in two years gave the holiday shopping season a strong start. Retail sales increased 0.8% last month, the Commerce Department announced today, beating analyst predictions of a 0.5% increase, according to the Wall Street Journal. That came after a 1.7% gain in October, which was propelled by a huge increase in auto sales. Auto sales retreated a bit in November. But excluding autos, sales rose 1.2%—the best showing since last March. Department store sales jumped 2.8%, the strongest advance in two years.

"(Oct 12, 2013  11:29 AM CDT) Erich Priebke, a former Nazi SS captain who evaded arrest for nearly 50 years after taking part in one of the worst atrocities by German occupiers in Italy during World War II, died yesterday at age 100. Priebke was finally extradited to Italy from Argentina in 1995 to face trial for the 1944 massacre, and he was sentenced to life in prison. However he served that sentence under house arrest at the Rome home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini. Priebke was tried and convicted for his role in the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians by Nazi forces at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome. The massacre was carried out in retaliation for an attack by resistance fighters that killed 33 members of a Nazi military police unit a day earlier. Priebke admitted shooting two people and rounding up victims, but insisted he was only following orders. Priebke escaped in 1946 from a British prison camp in Rimini, a resort town on Italy's Adriatic coast, and lived in Argentina for nearly 50 years before a US television program reported that he was living freely in the country. That started a lengthy extradition process that ended with him boarding a plane in Argentina on Nov. 20, 1995, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials, to stand trial in Italy. The country's highest appeals court upheld his conviction and life sentence in 1998.

The man is also accused of abusing a young girl he had with his daughter. Police allege that Jose Agostinho Pereira, 54, kept his daughter, now 28, under virtual house arrest in a two-room, thatched-roof hut near a tiny fishing village in northeastern Brazil.  He confessed to everything,  said an officer. The home was located in such a remote, jungle area that the only way to reach it was by using canoes. Authorities said the children appeared to suffer from malnutrition and could barely communicate with others. Most were unclothed.

"(Feb 11, 2016  12:08 PM) Euthanasia is itself not without controversy; the euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of the mentally ill even more so. It's an infrequent practice but one on the rise in the Netherlands, which is thought to have seen no more than five such cases in 1997 but 42 in 2013. Still,  little is known  about these cases, write researchers in a report published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. And so they reviewed the particulars of 66 patients who opted for EAS in the country from 2011 to 2014. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder, but there was also psychosis, PTSD, and anxiety and long-term eating disorders (most had more than one condition). About half had attempted suicide; almost all had a comorbidity (ranging from cancer to arthritis), though the study calls out one healthy 70-year-old woman who simply found her life a  living hell  in the year after her husband's death. As for how they came to end their lives,  the reality of implementing such programs is messy,  Reuters notes. In 32% of the cases, the patient had been refused EAS. The physicians for three of those 21 patients ultimately reversed their decisions; the other 18 got approval from a new physician. In 24% of the cases, there was physician disagreement, per a press release, and the New York Times points out that while most patients had long treatment histories, 56% had turned down at least some treatment. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Paul S. Applebaum sees further  red flags,  among them the 20% who had never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, the  ratio of women to men (2.3 to 1), and the 56% of cases in which social isolation or loneliness was important enough to be mentioned,  raising  the concern that physician-assisted death served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention.

The companies intend to build a second pipeline alongside an existing one from their Cushing, Okla., storage facility to Freeport, Texas, and another from Enbridge's hub in Flanagan, Ill., to Cushing. These pipelines have fewer hurdles to jump than Keystone, because the cross-border portion is already in place, but still must get approval from the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Army Corps of Engineers. And while they're less controversial than Keystone, environmental groups aren't thrilled with them, arguing that Canadian oil sands produce more corrosive crude, making pipeline leaks more likely. A similar Enbridge pipeline near Kalamazoo, Mich., sprang a costly leak in 2010.","Move Over, Keystone: 2 More Pipelines Planned"

"(Dec 3, 2019  7:11 AM) Jehad Serwan Mostafa is worth quite a bit to the FBI—up to $5 million, in fact. That's how much the agency is offering for information leading to the arrest of the 37-year-old US citizen, who appears on its  Most Wanted Terrorist List,  CNN reports. A new indictment unsealed Monday says the ex-San Diego resident offered  material support  to al-Shabab, an extremist Islamic group, and played a role in  planned operations  against African Union troops and the government of Somalia, per a Justice Department release. ABC News reports his leadership in the group has allegedly led to the injuries or deaths of hundreds of innocent people in Africa.  We believe this defendant is the highest-ranking US citizen fighting overseas with a terrorist organization,  US Attorney Robert Brewer says.  Al-Shabab's reign of terror threatens US national security, our international allies, and innocent civilians.  Mostafa, who's been tied to IED attacks in Somalia, is believed to be there at the moment. He was indicted in 2009 on a number of terrorism-related charges, but the new ones expand on those, accusing him of from March 2008 to February 2017 conspiring to provide material support, including himself as personnel, to terrorists; conspiring to provide material support to al-Shabab, a designated foreign terrorist group; and providing material support to al-Shabab.

"(Jun 1, 2019  5:30 AM CDT) Frank Lucas, the former Harlem drug kingpin whose life and lore inspired the 2007 movie American Gangster, has died, a relative said Friday. Lucas, who was 88, died Thursday in New Jersey, nephew Aldwan Lassiter said. Lucas had been in declining health, according to his former lawyer. Raised in North Carolina, Lucas climbed the ranks of crime in Harlem in the 1960s and '70s, becoming a major drug dealer known for supplying huge amounts of particularly potent heroin, per the AP. He said it netted him millions, and authorities seized over $500,000 in cash when they raided his house in Teaneck, NJ, in 1975. He was convicted and sentenced to decades in prison, but he turned informant and was released after about five years. Lucas was quickly arrested again for drug dealing, on a much smaller scale. He served seven more years, getting out again in 1991. Lucas' story became the basis for the Ridley Scott-directed American Gangster, starring Denzel Washington as Lucas and Russell Crowe as Richard  Richie  Roberts. The film got awards buzz but also brought scrutiny of claims about Lucas' legend, particularly a portrayal of him smuggling drugs in US soldiers' caskets during the Vietnam War; he said in 2008 he transported heroin via coffin just once. There was also pushback on an assertion that Lucas rooted out law enforcement corruption, but a suit on that was thrown out. As for Lucas' unquestioned role in supplying heroin that killed some users, he told the AP in 2007 that he regretted it.  I did some terrible things. I'm awfully sorry that I did them. I really am,  he said. Lucas had another brush with the law in 2012: He pleaded guilty to lying to try cashing in twice on a $17,000 federal disability benefit check. He was sentenced to five years' probation, with prosecutors saying they agreed to it due to his poor health and age.","Denzel Played Him. Now, a Drug Kingpin Dead at 88"

Two researchers in the remote Canadian Arctic found the bottle tucked into a mound of rocks on Ward Hunt Island, reports Popular Science. The note inside had a simple request: Measure the distance from the rocks to a nearby ice shelf, and then report back either to the note writer or to a colleague in Boston, reports the Halifax Chronicle Herald. It had names and addresses for both and was dated July 10, 1959. The modern-day researchers conducted the measurement and found that the ice sheet had retreated more than 200 feet since 1959, one tells the LA Times. But the story is about more than that particular scientific experiment. It turns out that the note writer was then-25-year-old Paul Walker and the colleague he mentioned was Albert Crary, both of whom are now renowned in polar research.  I recognized the two names instantly,  says one of the two who found it. (He mentions  goose bumps. ) Part of the fascination is that Walker suffered a stroke just weeks after writing the note and died later that same year.  I was just so pleased because it brought Paul back, in a way, and the work he had done,  says a historian who knew him.  He had a brilliant career as a glaciologist and all of a sudden, to be cut short that way.  And the finale: The two present-day researchers took photos of the note but put it back where they found it, along with another from themselves asking future researchers to conduct the same measurement, reports the CBC.

Yesterday's winning bid on the Dell Poweredge R410,  complete with hard drives, motherboard and everything,  came from a 17-year-old, but the cash—$33,000—was to come from his unknowing dad's account, Wired reports.

The server's actual worth is probably closer to $4,000, but it's  a relic of our time,  Bahnhof's CEO tells Reuters.  I believe this box has a very high symbolical value. In a way, it is a kind of artifact, an object that has made a mark on world history.  But WikiLeaks, not too thrilled with the auction, claimed it wasn't as important as Bahnhof made it out to be.

Relying on satellite communications and an unanswered ground-to-air phone call placed 17 minutes after the last recorded radar data, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau arrived at the following scenario: The Boeing 777 ran out of fuel after leaving its flight course, the right engine quit before the left, and the plane spiraled into the Indian Ocean west of Australia, USA Today reports.  This scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiraling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flameout,  the report states. Flight 370's final resting place based on that scenario may not be too far from where investigators are searching for the plane, which vanished March 8.

Park Police then moved in, citing a rule that  a 24-hour vigil requires no permit but must be continuously occupied.  When the shelter was AWOL yesterday morning, Picciotto and her supporters got help from DC congressional representative Eleanor Norton, who pulled some strings and helped get it put back into place. And Picciotto is back in action, too.  Now more than ever we need to communicate to people the danger of the nuclear bomb,  she says, per the LA Times.","After Hiccup, DC Protester Resumes 32-Year Vigil"

"(Jul 6, 2016  1:03 AM CDT) It's only halfway through the year and there have already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago, far more than recorded in the city this time last year—and far more casualties than the US suffered in the Gulf War. The milestone was passed over the Fourth of July weekend, when police say four people were killed and at least 46 injured in 42 shootings and one stabbing, reports CNN, which describes the mayhem as a  war among criminals  that has caught many innocent people in the crossfire. Police say there have been 319 murders in Chicago so far in 2016, around 50% more than at this time last year. There were 2,988 shooting victims in the city in the whole of 2015.  We have too many guns in the streets of Chicago and too many people willing to use them,  police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters Tuesday, though he didn't answer when asked what police plan to do to keep the violence under control for the rest of the year, the Chicago Tribune reports. Before the Fourth of July weekend, when gun violence in the city usually spikes, police arrested 88 people in gang raids aimed at preventing shootings. Some 5,000 cops, several thousand more than usual, were on patrol over the weekend, but while the strategy initially seemed to be a success, almost 30 people were shot late Sunday, hours after Johnson told reporters it appeared progress had been made in reducing violence.",More Than 2K People Have Been Shot in Chicago This Year

Gaby Scanlon, now 20, was with friends at Oscar's Wine Bar and Bistro in Lancaster in October 2012 to celebrate her 18th birthday when one of the staff handed her a free  Nitro-Jagermeister  shot.  I turned to the man and asked if it was OK to drink,  Scanlon told a Preston Crown Court yesterday.  He said 'yes.' Smoke was coming from my nose and mouth. Straight away I knew something was not right.  It wasn't: Internal tissue was destroyed and her stomach lining perforated, and she had to undergo emergency surgery to remove her stomach and have her small bowel attached to her esophagus. The bar's director was said to have been  intrigued by the dramatic effect  of a similar drink at a London hotel, so he decided to bring it to Oscar's. But a local health inspector had been concerned about the offering when he checked out the bar in May 2012 and had sent the bar a letter with notes on the safe way for liquid nitrogen drinks—which the BBC says aren't illegal—to be consumed; he says he never heard back from the bar. Scientists say the drink has to completely settle down and the liquid must evaporate before it's consumed, the broadcaster notes. The lawyer for the family that owns the bar says they're  mortified  and that  at no time did they see anything warning them of the risks of ingestion,  though they blamed the incident on their own  ignorance.

The boy, who suffered serious head injuries, a broken femur, and a fractured jaw, is expected to survive. Found at the foot of his family's apartment building in St. Paul around 8:40am Monday, he was conscious and breathing but unable to tell officers what had happened, reports KARE.

Trump was to travel back to Washington later Sunday and aides said he would likely address reporters, but the nation did not glimpse the president in the immediate aftermath of a shooting in El Paso, Texas, that killed at least 20 people and, hours later, one in Dayton, Ohio, that claimed at least nine lives.

"(Oct 27, 2020  6:50 PM CDT) A government-backed task force says that with cases of colon and rectal cancer steadily rising among younger people, it is lowering the recommended starting age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45. If the proposal from the US Preventive Services Task Force is finalized, which is expected to happen around a month from now, insurers will be required to cover the earlier screenings under the Affordable Care Act, the Wall Street Journal reports. The American Cancer Society made the same recommendation in 2018. The National Cancer Institute says that while overall colorectal cancer deaths are decreasing, cases rose by 51% between 1994 and 2014 in people under 55. Deaths in that age group rose 11% from 2005 to 2015.  The risk of getting colon cancer for a 45-year-old today is the same as for a 50-year-old in the past,  says panel chairman Dr. Alex Krist, per the New York Times. The panel said that Black people in particular should be encouraged to undergo screening early because they are among the groups most at risk. Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer this year at age 43, four years after he was diagnosed. While the recommendation for screening to start at age 45 would not have affected his case, doctors say they hope the change will raise awareness of the disease among younger people and encourage them and their doctors to take warning signs like rectal bleeding seriously. Krist warns, however, that screening is vital because most people who get colorectal cancer do not show any symptoms at first.",Task Force Says Colon Cancer Screening Should Start at 45
"(Feb 3, 2015  9:45 AM) To Kill a Mockingbird will not be Harper Lee's only published book after all. Publisher Harper announced today that Go Set a Watchman, a novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author completed in the 1950s and put aside, will be released July 14. Rediscovered last fall, Go Set a Watchman is essentially a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although it was finished earlier. The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years. The publisher plans a first printing of 2 million copies.  In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman,  the 88-year-old Lee said in a statement issued by Harper.  It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became To Kill a Mockingbird) from the point of view of the young Scout.   I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.  Carter came upon the manuscript at a  secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird,  the publisher says. The new book is set in Lee's famed Maycomb, Ala., during the mid-1950s, 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird and roughly contemporaneous with the time that Lee was writing the story. Lee's publisher said the author is unlikely to do any publicity for the book.

Foray was the best-known woman among the voice performers who contributed so much to the classic cartoons of Warner Bros., Disney, Hanna-Barbera, and other studios. She had a galaxy of ways to create funny but believable characters, but could also be warm and wise in Disney's Mulan or, in a memorable Twilight Zone episode, chilling.

The Cold War conflict pitted the moose and squirrel against the bumbling spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, to whom Foray also gave a voice.

Coconuts Bangkok reports Thai resident Attaporn Boonmakchuay was five minutes into his  usual bowel movement  Wednesday morning when a huge python bit him on the penis. The 10-foot snake had, well, snaked its way through his home's plumbing, according to the AP.

In all, it took the 38-year-old Attaporn—who understandably passed out immediately afterward—more than half an hour to free his penis from the python's jaws. Emergency workers arrived to find the snake still partially inside the toilet. They freed it with hammers and planned to release it back into the wild.

That's why the company's 2015 F-150, which will appear at dealerships next month, will have a body made almost entirely out of aluminum rather than steel. Customers' biggest concern about pickup trucks is their gas mileage, executive chairman Bill Ford tells the New York Times. With the aluminum version some 700 pounds lighter than previous models, the F-150 will see its mileage improve by 5% to 15%, Ford says. Aluminum is as strong as steel, the AP reports, though it's a little pricier. The base model will now cost an additional $395, making it $26,615. And right now, gas prices are around their lowest in four years. But  even with gas at $3 a gallon, fuel economy is still very important to people,  says Bill Ford.

The National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, a group of 15 trusts holding 800,000 student loans worth around $12 billion, has been pursuing borrowers in court, but case after case is being tossed out because the trusts have been unable to produce paperwork proving they actually own the loans, the New York Times reports. Lawyers say that since the loans generally passed through many hands before reaching National Collegiate, the paperwork involved is so shoddy that it could affect most of the $5 billion of its debt that is in default. Some borrowers say the company has sued them trying to collect on high-interest loans that they never even took out. National Collegiate has been going after old debts so aggressively that Bloomberg dubs it a  lawsuit machine,  though lawyers say that since most debtors who are sued either pay up or ignore the summons, resulting in a default judgment, the company tends to back off in the relatively rare cases when debtors go to court. But such cases may become more common:  As news of the servicing issues and the trusts’ inability to produce the documents needed to foreclose on loans spreads, the likelihood of more defaults rises,  the company's lawyers warned in a recent filing.",Paperwork Errors Could Wipe Out $5B in Student Loans

"(Sep 4, 2011  7:45 AM CDT) A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on charges of impersonating a physician's assistant and working in a Florida hospital's emergency room for a week, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Police say Matthew Scheidt dressed in a lab coats and surgical scrubs, conducted physical exams, and reportedly even gave CPR to a man suffering a heart attack. Scheidt told the hospital he was a 23-year-old physician's assistant from a nearby university, bragging that his mother was an executive at the company that owned the hospital and that he was a surgical assistant. When the hospital confronted Scheidt about his deception, he claimed to be on a  top secret  investigation for the police. It wasn't Scheidt's first time faking an important job.

The Grammy-winning star told the audience at his show in Auburn Hills, about 30 miles from Detroit, that he and tour promoter Live Nation are redirecting funds from the show to the charity the Community Foundation of Greater Flint. In 2014, Flint switched water sources and failed to add corrosion-reducing phosphates, allowing lead from old pipes to leach into the water. Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water.  I'm very thankful to the Michigan audience for joining me in supporting this cause,  Mars said in a statement.  Ongoing challenges remain years later for Flint residents, and it's important that we don't forget our brothers and sisters affected by this disaster.

"(Sep 8, 2016  7:05 PM CDT) Four Oakland police officers are being fired and another seven suspended without pay after a teenage sex worker claimed she had sex with more than a dozen officers, some while she was underage and occasionally for tips about future prostitution raids, the Los Angeles Times reports. According to CNN, the scandal broke last fall when an Oakland police officer killed himself. The sex worker claimed to have had a sexual relationship with that officer while she was 17, and his suicide note named other officers sleeping with her, the Washington Post reports. That launched an investigation that ended up implicating 28 officers across five departments. The Oakland Police Department alone burned through three police chiefs during the investigation. The four Oakland officers who are in the process of being fired were found guilty of attempted sexual assault, engaging in lewd conduct, assisting in the crime of prostitution, and more. The other seven were found to have failed to report sexual misconduct. An eighth officer must receive counseling and additional training. None of the officers were identified, and a criminal investigation into the allegations is still ongoing. Two of the officers have already resigned.

"(Feb 9, 2017  9:00 AM) A colossal panoramic painting depicting the Battle of Atlanta from the US Civil War will be lifted by cranes from the building where it's been housed for nearly a century and then trucked to its new location. Moving the 6-ton Cyclorama, one of the nation's largest paintings, from Grant Park to the Atlanta History Center across town marks a major milestone in its restoration, historians say. The move—which architects and engineers have coordinated with German, Swiss, and US conservators—is expected to begin Thursday and take two days, the AP reports. The painting's vivid scenes of charging soldiers, rearing horses, and broken bodies stretches the length of a football field when it's fully unfurled. But to prep for its big move, it's been cut at a seam into two pieces. Both pieces are already rolled onto gigantic, custom-built steel spools, each of them taller than a four-story building. Holes have been cut in the concrete roof of the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum in Grant Park. Cranes will be used to lift the spools through the roof and onto waiting trucks for the trip to a building under construction at the history center, says Howard Pousner, a center spokesman. Those in charge say they're using extreme caution to ensure the 15,000-square-foot painting isn't damaged.  If there's anything that endangers the painting, we will slow down to a crawl,  Pousner notes. The artwork, created by the American Panorama Co. in the 1880s, is one of only two such panoramas on display in the US. The other one is at Pennsylvania's Gettysburg National Military Park.

"(Sep 6, 2018  4:21 PM CDT) Jocelyn Bell Burnell was a PhD student at Cambridge University some five decades ago when she made an astronomical discovery while reviewing data from a radio telescope: faint, repeating pulses of radio waves. These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as  a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves.  The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prize—but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy. But, since then, Bell Burnell has won plenty of other accolades.  I feel I've done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize,  she tells the Guardian.  If you get the Nobel Prize you have this fantastic week and nobody gives you anything else. If you don't get the Nobel Prize, you get everything that moves. That's much more fun.  And in November, Bell Burnell will receive another honor: the Breakthrough Prize, a $3 million award funded by Silicon Valley types, such as Mark Zuckerberg. She  thoroughly deserves this recognition,  says Yuri Milner, who founded the Breakthrough Prize, per SA, adding that she  revealed one of the most interesting objects in the universe.

"(Sep 20, 2017  10:05 AM CDT) Feathers, wishbones, colored eggs. If they're things you associate as only found in birds, you're wrong, says paleontologist Mark Norell. It turns out dinosaurs evolved all three, though we've only just recently learned about that last item. The discovery of fossil egg-shells in China has upended the conventional wisdom that all dino eggs were white, a belief born out of the fact that, as National Geographic reports, lizard, turtle, and crocodile eggs are white. But as a study newly published in Peer J explains, researchers now believe that a species of oviraptor named Heyuannia huangi laid blue-green eggs. While fossil eggs often end up looking brown or black, the 67 million-year-old ones found in China seemed blueish, which led scientists to try—and, as it turns out, succeed—to identify bits of colored pigments. The two, biliverdin (blue) and protoporphyrin (red), are typically found in today's bird eggs, and the researchers speculate that the coloring may have worked as a protective camouflage.  It was a huge surprise. I couldn't believe it,  says co-author Jasmina Wiemann. The findings suggest the dinosaurs were at least partially open nesting, as  colored eggs are present in most modern birds which build open nests, as the eggs are vulnerable due to periods without parental guarding.  A 2015 report from CBS News on the initial findings shares another hypothesis: that male oviraptors may have provided care for the eggs, as is the case among their colored-egg modern bird counterparts.

Nine federal search warrants were executed in Bardstown, south of Louisville, including at the homes of Brooks Houck, his brother, and their mother.

In a trial involving more than 11,000 at-risk people in Guinea, nobody given the vaccine developed the virus after a 10-day incubation period, researchers wrote in a study published in the Lancet medical journal Thursday.  While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,  says the study's lead author, World Health Organization Assistant Director-General Marie-Paule Kieny. Only two patients suffered serious reactions to the vaccine, and no long-term problems were reported. Researchers are still trying to determine how long the vaccine is effective for.

I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles way from Washington's swamp,  he said,  spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?  He then suggested that he might attend the dinner next year—but said he'd also consider returning to Pennsylvania. The economy, so far, has been Trump's ally. Polls show that Americans feel slightly better about his job performance on that subject than his job performance overall.

"(Dec 11, 2015  12:11 AM) Two Afghan airmen who didn't show up for training at a US Air Force base in Georgia on Monday are missing, and authorities suspect it's because they don't want to go home. An Air Force spokesman tells USA Today that law enforcement officials are searching for Mirwais Kohistani and Shirzad Rohullah, who were being trained in aircraft maintenance. The spokesman tells 11Alive that the men were nominated by the Afghan Air Force and heavily vetted by US authorities before being accepted for training at Moody Air Force Base, so they probably don't pose a threat to anybody in the US.  It's not the first time it's happened, so we just want to find them if we can,  he says. Another Air Force spokesman tells the AP that the trainees, who were allowed off the base over the weekend and haven't been heard from since, were due to graduate from the training program next week and return to Afghanistan. The police chief in the nearby town of Valdosta tells the AP that there is  zero indication  that the men are terrorists.  You've got to remember these folks were cleared by the US military and by the Department of Defense to come in and train,  he says.  These guys have been here since February of 2015, and they have not caused a problem at all.

"(Dec 27, 2016  11:57 AM) A naval program that has become a target for critics is preparing to commission a new vessel named after a well-known shooting survivor. The USS Gabrielle Giffords, constructed by Austal USA in Mobile, Ala., has completed testing in the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to be commissioned in mid-2017, the AP reports. The company handed over the $475 million ship to the Navy on Friday. Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot during a 2011 assassination attempt, helped christen the ship in 2015. The 421-foot-long Giffords will be the ninth in a series of high-speed vessels designed to navigate in shallow coastal regions known as littoral waters. It's part of a hotly debated program that congressional critics slam as flawed and too expensive but that Navy leaders defend as a critical new step in naval warfighting. Arizona Sen. John McCain has cited the $12.4 billion spent for 26 littoral combat ships as the worst example of wasteful Pentagon spending. The ship's name also has become a target for conservatives who see it as promoting stricter gun laws, a cause Giffords has promoted. The Navy said it chose to name the ship in honor of Giffords because of the perseverance she showed after the shooting.  Courage comes in many, many forms—physical, mental, spiritual, and political. Gabby has truly modeled courage and resilience,  Vice Adm. Philip Cullom said at the christening ceremony. Constructed from aluminum and featuring a distinctive trimaran design, the Giffords is armed with missiles, machine guns, and fast-firing weapons designed to hit a variety of targets. Its normal crew of 40 sailors and officers can be supplemented as needed for missions.",Navy's New $475M Warship: USS Gabrielle Giffords
"(Oct 20, 2015  9:31 AM CDT) A solid alibi did nothing to keep David Owens from getting arrested—because he matched a less-than-credible witness' vague description of a subway thief who was a young black male in a hoodie, the New York Daily News reports. Owens is now suing New York City and 11 NYPD officers for wrongfully arresting him in the early hours of Oct. 23, 2012, as well as for the six weeks he languished at Rikers Island until his case was dropped for lack of evidence. Owens says in the suit that his trouble started when he clocked out of his stock clerk job at Macy's at 3am, then headed home on the No. 1 subway, per Newsweek. But several cops got on the train at the 50th Street station,  demanded  Owens' ID, removed him from the train, and searched him. The problem: a crying  Caucasian woman  who said her backpack had been stolen at a train station at 2:30am.  The woman's description of the culprit was limited at best—i.e., a young African American male with a dark hoodie,  the lawsuit states. Owens had no backpack, offered up his punched timecard, and gave cops contact info for his supervisor, but police took the word of the witness—described in the police affidavit as  erratic, possibly intoxicated, and definitely hysterical,  per the Daily News—and carted Owens off. He was charged with grand larceny and thrown in jail, where he stayed for six weeks because he couldn't pay the $3,500 bail—a stint that cost him his job.  He became a victim of the worst stereotype there is: a young African-American male in a hoodie up to no good,  his lawyer says.

After the Nazis took over his homeland in 1939, Tadeusz Sawicz made his way to France, where he fought until Paris fell; he then took up the fight in Britain in July 1940, just as the Luftwaffe began its three-month-long failed assault on England. Some 17,000 Polish pilots, mechanics, and ground staff fought for Britain, leading Winston Churchill to say of the decisive victory,  Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.  Sawicz earned Distinguished Flying Crosses from Poland four times, as well as the American, British, and Dutch equivalent for his service during the war.

CNN reports that Reynolds was in tears when the bidding ended after 20 minutes, with the buyer paying $4.6 million for the dress and another $1 million to the auction house. The dress was only expected to fetch $2 million; the previous record for a Marilyn dress was $1.26 million, for the gown she wore while singing  Happy Birthday  to JFK.

A campaign aide confirmed that Romney will be keeping his private insurance plan. The candidate's Medicare policy statement says he believes wealthier seniors should receive less support, although Democrats are likely to use his decision to portray him as out of touch with the average American senior, Politico notes. Romney's campaign marked his birthday by issuing a memo accusing President Obama of trying to  end Medicare as we know it  through spending cuts and other means.

"(May 19, 2016  1:05 PM CDT) Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll released Thursday. These financial difficulties span all income levels, according to the poll conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. In households making less than $50,000 a year, 75% of people would have difficulty coming up with $1,000 to cover an unexpected bill. But when income rose to between $50,000 and $100,000, the difficulty decreased only modestly to 67%. Even for the country's wealthiest 20%—households making more than $100,000 a year—38% say they would have at least some difficulty coming up with $1,000. As to how they'd pay it, among those who wouldn't use cash they had on hand, a third said they would have to borrow from a bank or from friends and family, or put the bill on a credit card; 13% would skip paying other bills, and 11% said they would likely not pay the bill at all. Those numbers suggest that most American families do not have at least $1,000 stashed away in an accessible savings account, much less under their mattresses, to cover an emergency. Still, two-thirds of Americans said they feel positive about their finances, according to the survey data, which the AP sees as a sign that they're managing day-to-day expenses fine.

But the Brooklyn girl remains on life support as her parents fight over her organs: Mom Teoka Spruill wants them donated, while dad Terrell Smith doesn't want his daughter's body cut up and  desecrated,  the New York Times reports.  She was born with that, she’s going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes—it’s what makes her her,  Smith, 26, tells the paper.  My daughter was born with that, and she’s going to lie down with the same thing.  But Spruill paints him as an absent father who didn't care much about his daughter until Spruill, 25, married David Adams, also 25, last spring. Adams has been charged with assault, and could see those charges upgraded to murder. But all of that is on hold as Thaiya's parents fight over how to proceed. At a family court hearing today, Spruill was expected to argue that she has proof she had sole custody and can thus decide what happens to Thaiya's organs. But Smith insists he fought for custody, and says he told officials this summer that he worried she was being abused. They investigated in September, during which time Thaiya stayed with her maternal great-grandmother, but she was ultimately returned home. The following month, Smith kept Thaiya at his own mother's house for two weeks—she cried because she didn't want to return home, he says—and ended up arrested over it; Spruill got an order of protection against him after claiming he threatened to kill her.",2-Year-Old Girl Kept Alive as Parents Fight Over Organs

In July, he was arrested and accused of abusing 24 boys. The State's Attorney for Charles County says Bell is accused of abusing boys between the ages of 11 and 17 at Benjamin Stoddert Middle School, his home, and other locations. Bell is HIV-positive, and five counts in the new indictment accuse him of trying to transmit the virus to his victims, People reports. None of them have tested positive, authorities say, though 14 of the 42 have yet to be identified. Bell, who allegedly forced the boys to perform sex acts on him and recorded the abuse on video, was investigated and removed from his job late last year after a parent found inappropriate messages from him on her son's phone.

"(Dec 16, 2019  10:35 AM) Anyone expecting February's Iowa caucuses to add a little clarity to the Democratic race might want to adjust those expectations. As the Des Moines Register reports, new rules this year make it possible that three different candidates could emerge from the Feb. 3 caucuses claiming to be the winner. The short version of the explanation: The state Democratic Party will for the first time be disclosing raw vote totals from the caucuses. The longer explanation involves an understanding of the arcane way the state caucuses work. As reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel writes, the traditional  winner  in Iowa has long been decided  by a complicated system of state delegate equivalents, which operates kind of like the Electoral College.  That won't change—one candidate will still be the winner in terms of delegates. But the state party will for the first time disclose raw totals from the first count of votes at gatherings (the  first alignment ), as well as from the second and final one. Of course, one candidate could sweep them all,  but it's also fully possible that a different candidate could 'win' each of the three metrics,  writes Pfannenstiel. Each would come with its own bragging points. Meanwhile, an analysis at Fortune makes the case that while Iowa typically doesn't decide who will be president, it plays a strong role in deciding who won't be president.

If it does indeed develop into a Category 1 storm, it will be the state's first hurricane since 2008, CNN reports. The National Hurricane Center is warning the state could see  multiple hazards  from the storm; meteorologists are predicting 10 to 20 inches of rain from the state's Gulf Coast toward Houston and into San Antonio. Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 30 counties along the Gulf.

"(Jan 17, 2019  8:21 AM) When federal prosecutors charged Michael Cohen with campaign-finance violations in August, documents mentioned the $130,000 reimbursement he received for a hush-money payment made to Stormy Daniels—and tacked on mention of another $50,000 reimbursement made at the same time for  tech services.  The Wall Street Journal reports it now has the story behind that second figure. Per its reporting, Trump's former lawyer engaged the tech firm RedFinch Solutions LLC to do two things, the details of which were apparently never conveyed to the Trump Organization: try to sway two online polls in Donald Trump's favor (the effort was unsuccessful) and start and run a praise-filled Twitter account called @WomenForCohen that described him as a  pit bull  and  sex symbol.  He was to pay RedFinch owner John Gauger $50,000 for the work. Gauger, who also serves as CIO at Virginia's Liberty University, claims Cohen didn't fork over that amount. But Cohen was apparently paid it by the Trump Organization, which sources say did not ask for specifics about the services rendered,  demonstrat[ing] the level of trust the lawyer once had within the Trump Organization.  In the Journal's telling, Gauger showed up at Trump Tower in early 2015 and was given, by Cohen, a bag with at most $13,000 in it, along with a boxing glove that allegedly belonged to a Brazilian MMA fighter. Cohen, without elaboration, told the Journal all payments were made by check. As for the polls, Gauger was reportedly tasked with writing a computer script that would continually vote for Trump in a 2014 CNBC poll of America's business leaders (Trump didn't make the top 100) and a 2015 Drudge Report poll of top 2016 GOP candidates (Trump ended up fifth).","Trump Reimbursed Cohen for $50K, and the Story Is Strange"
"(Dec 29, 2016  11:07 AM) With the bookends of David Bowie dying and the deaths of Carrie Fisher and mom Debbie Reynolds—and Prince, George Michael, Brexit, and a contentious US election in between—Sam Sanders admits he, like many others, has taken to calling 2016  the worst.  But Sanders writes for NPR that while the past 12 months may indeed deserve a spot in the midst of a white-hot dumpster fire, 2016 may not have actually been as bad as all that—and  it surely can't be the worst year of all time,  he notes. He runs through things that many Americans can be thankful for, including a recovering economy, our relatively safe existence, and, yes, for Trump supporters, a satisfying conclusion to Election 2016. Plus, much of the  '2016 is awful' rhetoric  was helped along by what Nikki Usher, a George Washington University media professor, calls  ambient journalism,  a nonstop engagement with online news and headlines via social media that basically,  over time … becomes an assault.   Every five minutes, another sad headline, another Twitter mention or fight, another shared link on Facebook, another push notification. Another hit,  Sanders writes. Combine that with this year's seemingly prevailing narrative—that of  a nation, and even a world, completely and disastrously divided, perhaps beyond repair —and it's easy to see why 2016 has earned its black-sheep status on the calendar.  Lots of crappy, bad things happen every year, but you aren't told over and over again that this just shows us how bad everything is,  Usher notes. There's also the medium of the Internet itself, often used  ironically, with hyperbole, and usually, with a wink and a nod  by people who are privileged enough to have access to it, University of Southern California professor Robert Hernandez notes.  Let's … acknowledge that saying 2016 is the worst on Twitter says more about the tweeter, and the medium, than perhaps about the year itself,  Sanders says. His full take here.",2016 Is 'the Worst'?

Morsi, the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president, became Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago. He took the oath today before the Supreme Constitutional Court in its Nile-side courthouse built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple. Morsi has vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over after Mubarak's overthrow.

"(May 18, 2012  8:07 AM CDT) Families of 9/11 victims are dismayed that a financial dispute has indefinitely delayed completion of the museum at Ground Zero. The museum, a companion to the 9/11 memorial, was supposed to be finished by this year's 11th anniversary, but officials now say that's not possible. The holdup stems from a financial battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the foundation that controls the memorial and museum, reports the AP. The Port Authority says the foundation owes it $300 million for infrastructure and updated project costs; the foundation counters that the port owes it money because of project delays. Personal items that families have donated to the museum are stuck in storage while the dispute, which has slowed down work since late last year, drags on.  We were supposed to get a contemplative area nearby where we could sit and pray, visit,  says one woman whose sister worked on the 101st floor of the World Trade Center's south tower. No trace of her sister was ever identified, and she wants the museum to open so she can visit the thousands of fragments of human remains that could not be identified. Officials say progress has been made toward resolving the dispute, but family members say they have not been kept apprised of the progress.",New Thorn for 9/11 Families: Ground Zero Museum Delay
"(Jan 9, 2014  6:20 AM) Werner C. is 88 years old, but his fate now rests with the young offenders chamber of the Cologne court. That's because the man was just 19 during the 1944 massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane in France, in which 642 people were killed, Reuters reports. Men were herded into barns and shot, while the women and children were burned alive in the town church, all in retaliation for the kidnapping of a single German soldier by the French resistance. Prosecutors say Werner, a member of the elite Waffen SS, shot 25 people with his machine gun, and helped burn the church. The pensioner doesn't deny being there, but says he never fired.  I had the great luck of being deployed for something else,  his lawyer quotes him as saying.  He said, 'I heard shots, I saw people shouting, I saw the village burning. It was terrible.'  Oradour-sur-Glane is a touchy subject not just because of the scale of the atrocity, but because no one was ever punished—the unit's commander was captured by Allied forces, but never extradited to France. Prosecutors found Werner thanks to a poster campaign from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, urging Germans to report elderly neighbors they suspected of Nazi war crimes, the New York Times reports.  It's important that we find someone, even if it's 70 years afterward,  said one of the six people who survived the massacre.","Ex-Nazi, 88, in Young Offender Court Over WWII Massacre"
"(Aug 3, 2020  8:43 AM CDT) In addition to US service members, military dogs are sent onto battlefields to help defeat foes, and a demonstration last year at a Florida nonprofit was meant to show how that's done. But video has now emerged of that demo in Fort Pierce at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, with the so-called target used to draw the K9 attackers attracting both controversy and an investigation by the Naval Special Warfare Command, the Washington Post reports. As seen in the first clip now circulating on social media, four dogs leap one by one onto a man called  Josh  by the announcer, clamping down on his padded arms and doing their job at subduing him. What's spurring the backlash, however, is what else Josh is wearing: a red Colin Kaepernick jersey. In a second video, Josh is seen taken down by a dog and mock-moaning,  Oh man, I will stand,  which brings laughter from the crowd, per Yahoo Sports. It's not yet clear who recorded the video of the demo, which was originally posted on Instagram in January 2019 in now-deleted posts, with one caption noting the Kaepernick stand-in was set upon by the dogs for  not standing during the national anthem.  BuzzFeed News notes the videos went viral after filmmaker Billy Corben shared them.  The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the US Navy,  the Navy said in a statement, noting it so far doesn't appear any active Navy personnel were involved in the event, or that any Navy equipment was used during the demo.

"(Mar 8, 2013  2:22 PM) The top 83 US-based companies now hold a massive $1.45 trillion offshore, parked in low-tax countries, after increasing those holdings by 14.4%—or $183 billion—just in the last year, reports Bloomberg. The leader in offshore profit parking is GE, with $108 billion, up $6 billion from last year, followed by Pfizer with $73 billion. Tech giants Google, Apple, and Microsoft increased their non-US holdings by 34% last year and $75.2 billion over the past two years. Experts say the rise is due to US tax laws, which incentivize booking profits offshore, and estimate the total amount all US companies (not just the top 83) are keeping offshore could be $1.9 trillion.  The corporate system is broken and it’s broken primarily because of international,  says one professor of tax law. The United States is one of the few countries that applies its full 35% corporate tax rate to profits made by US-based companies' overseas offices, but companies can defer paying taxes until they return those profits home. Congress is working on alternative tax strategies—such as levying a much smaller tax on accumulated earnings, whether repatriated or not—but for now, those stockpiles keep growing.",US Companies Stashing $1.9 Trillion Overseas

Nothing particularly romantic: It held a 1914 postcard from a Glasgow boat captain, who sent 1,890 more like it; of those, 315 have been found. The dispersed bottles were made to sink in order to investigate Scottish currents. The postcard offers a reward of six pence to the finder.

"(Jun 16, 2015  9:48 AM CDT) The Obama administration is cracking down on artificial trans fats, calling them a threat to public health. The FDA said today it will require food companies to phase out the use of artificial trans fats almost entirely. Consumers aren't likely to notice much of a difference, but the administration says the move will reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year. The FDA made a preliminary determination in 2013 that trans fats no longer fall in the agency's  generally recognized as safe  category, and made that decision final today, giving food companies three years to phase them out. With trans fats off the list, any company that wants to use them will have to petition the FDA, which is unlikely to allow many uses. Once a staple of the American diet—think shortening and microwave popcorn—most trans fats are already gone. The FDA says between 2003 and 2012, consumer trans-fat consumption decreased about 78% as food companies used other kinds of oils. Still, the FDA says those trans fats still in the food supply are a public health concern. Scientists say there are no health benefits to trans fats, created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid (they're often called partially hydrogenated oils). Trans fats are used in processing food and in restaurants, usually to improve texture, shelf life, or flavor, but they can raise levels of  bad  cholesterol and lower  good  cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease. The FDA hasn't targeted small amounts of trans fats that occur naturally in some meat and dairy products because they'd be too difficult to remove.

But beneath the bravado, Chavez is in trouble, the Financial Times reports, as cratering oil prices pummel his economy. Rising oil prices have been the wind in Chavez’s sails, allowing him to spend lavishly on social  missions  and pull in voters.  But those missions appear increasingly mismanaged, as have his government participation initiatives.

The tennis star found three of her sponsors—Nike, Tag Heuer, and Porsche—swiftly backing away from her. A  saddened and surprised  Nike announced it would suspend their relationship during the course of the investigation. The BBC reports on just how big a deal this is: The 28-year-old's relationship with the company began when she was just 11; the two signed a $70 million, 8-year contract in 2010, and she has her own clothing line with the company. As for the others: Swiss watch brand Tag Heuer had been in talks with Sharapova to renew a sponsorship that ended in 2015, but  in view of the current situation,  no renewal will take place. Porsche, whose contract with Sharapova runs through 2016, has  chosen to postpone planned activities  with her  until further details are released and we can analyze the situation.  The drug in question is described by the AP as the  little-known  meldonium. Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, has been taking it for a decade; it only this year became a banned substance as per World Anti-Doping Agency code, due to its potential to bolster oxygen uptake and endurance. The drug promotes blood flow, and the New York Times quotes Sharapova's description of why she started taking it:  I was getting sick very often. I had a deficiency in magnesium. I had irregular EKG results, and I had a family history of diabetes and there were signs of diabetes.

Rand Paul presented tissue paper avoidance of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that added hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit and now he stands up at the last minute, after 15 years of blood, sweat, and tears from the 9/11 community, to say that it's all over now and we're going to balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community,  Stewart said in a Fox News interview. He described Paul's opposition to the bill, which would ensure the fund never ran out of money, as  absolutely outrageous.  Earlier Wednesday, Paul objected to the projected $10.2 billion cost of funding the bill over the next decade, saying any new spending  should be offset by cutting spending that is less valuable,  USA Today reports. In the Fox interview, Stewart was joined by John Feal, a former first responder injured on 9/11 who founded the Feal Good Foundation to help other first responders. He criticized Paul and Sen.

After losing a five-year battle to keep her rent from spiking from $820 to $3,500 per month, Adele Sarno's Little Italy home will likely be taken over by her landlord: the Italian American Museum, which, according to its website, is  dedicated to the struggles of Italian-Americans and their achievements and contributions to American culture and society,  the New York Times reports. The irony isn't lost on Sarno.  I was here all my life,  she tells CBS New York. Of museum founder Joseph Scelsa, she notes,  I'm more the Italian one than he is.  The situation is  absolute hypocrisy,  adds the director of an affordable housing group.  You're fighting a museum that purports to exhibit Italian-American culture and then proceeds to evict a living artifact.  Sarno, who has a monthly income of $750 and gets assistance from Social Security and relatives, says she believed her apartment was rent-controlled, but a judge ruled otherwise. She can't afford a rent hike. The museum, which plans to sell Sarno's building, said she would need to be out by April 6. Sarno managed to delay the eviction and is to appear in court on April 2. If she's forced to leave, she says she and her 19-year-old cat, Tosha, will likely be forced to move in with her daughter in Wisconsin. It's a  beautiful place, but not for me,  Sarno tells DNAinfo.  I'm a New Yorker.  Sarno isn't the museum's only casualty: The nearby Il Palazzo restaurant was handed an eviction notice last week after a late rent payment in February. It closed its doors yesterday, DNAinfo reports. Says the eatery's 71-year-old owner:  It feels like my heart's ripped out.","Little Italy Museum Evicting 'Artifact': Grandma, 85"
"(Dec 29, 2013  5:57 PM) A Long Island man who discovered a lost lottery ticket has finally been awarded his prize: $1 million. Marvin Martinez, 27-year-old landscaper, says he was collecting leaves from a gutter last November when he spotted the  Win $1,000 a Week for Life  scratch card, WNBC-TV reports via the New York Post. He took it home, dried it out, and contacted the New York Lottery's customer service. They promised to investigate, and Martinez says he  forgot about it —until his phone rang three weeks ago. The New York State Gaming Commission gave him the ticket because no one had claimed it a year after it was purchased. Martinez chose to the take the payment in one lump sum, which comes to $515,612 after taxes—but he kept it secret from his wife, who works at a Subway shop, until the official announcement Friday. Her reaction:  I can’t believe. I can’t believe it.  Now he plans to send money back home to El Salvador, buy a house, and help his mother pay off repairs from Hurricane Sandy.

According to the Oregonian, the lawsuit states that a fully-clothed Charles Ziemer was pedaling back to his car after participating in the June 2016 ride when his wheels suddenly struck the islands. The lawsuit faults the city for failing to put reflectors or lights on the islands and situating them in a travel lane. An employee at the Portland city attorney's office says the city doesn't comment on pending litigation.

"(Apr 4, 2018  12:54 PM CDT) Some Google employees have sent CEO Sundar Pichai a letter. Well, more than some: It has at least 3,100 signatures—not quite 5% of the workforce—and implores Pichai to withdraw the company from Project Maven. That's a Pentagon program focused on using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, and the New York Times reports it could increase the precision of drone strikes. The Times sees this fight as a sort of bellwether for what's to come as AI advances developed in Silicon Valley are more frequently put to use by the military.  We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,  states what Fast Company calls a  fiery  letter. The employees write that they want the company to turn that sentiment into policy by pledging to never  build warfare technology.  Though Google says the company's role in Project Maven is limited to  non-offensive purposes,  the letter states that  the technology is being built for the military, and once it’s delivered it could easily be used to assist in  tasks like launching weapons. The Times makes the argument that the publicity around the contract—first revealed in March by Gizmodo—could hamper Google when it comes to the ultra-competitive recruitment of AI researchers, who might find the military connection off-putting. That said, Amazon and Microsoft also have Pentagon contracts, but the letter-signers write that those companies' military work  doesn't make this any less risky for Google. Google's unique history, its motto Don’t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.

"(Jun 10, 2015  6:46 PM CDT) A new batch of cholesterol-lowering drugs could bring new hope to patients who can't take popular statins, or for those who don't feel their effects. Today, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of Amgen's Repatha, reports AP, just one day after it gave the green light to a similar drug called Praluent from Sanofi and Regeneron. Both self-injected drugs are designed to lower LDL cholesterol (the  bad cholesterol ) and belong to a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, HealthDay reports. Early studies suggest they lower LDL more effectively than statins. The FDA will make its decision this summer, but is expected to follow the committee's advice, reports CNN, which calls the drugs  the most important new class of cholesterol-lowering medications since the first statin was approved in 1987.  However,  definitive evidence  on whether they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths won't be out until 2017, after long-term trials, reports the New York Times. While statins are proven to prevent heart attack and stroke, they don't work for everyone, and up to 25% of statin users battle side effects like muscle pain, which hasn't appeared in trials of PCSK9 inhibitors, notes CNN. However, some patients on PCSK9 inhibitors have reported being confused and unable to focus.  For all those patients unable to take statins, finally there might be an option that can change (their) outcomes,  says a cardiologist not involved in the research.  We need to patiently wait for the next phase of trials to see whether the clinical outcomes are as promising as the initial studies suggest.  The downside: Most estimates say the drugs could cost $10,000 per year, while statins cost a few hundred dollars per year.",2 New Cholesterol Drugs May Be Game-Changers

The Labor Department also had grim news for the previous two months: The economy did not create nearly as many jobs as was originally thought, and those figures have been revised down to show 49,000 fewer jobs created. That means we're averaging 73,000 jobs per month for the last two months, which is just one-third of the jobs added per month in the first quarter, the AP reports.  This is bad.

Protesters were initially furious over the increased fees; now they're also opposing a new law limiting demonstration rights, the Guardian reports. Bill 78 requires protesters to get a permit and give police eight hours' notice before holding a demonstration. But it hasn't held protesters back: Some 300,000 marched in Montreal Tuesday, prompting 100 arrests. The next night, police let what they dubbed an illegal protest continue for four hours, then began arrests, with 518 people ultimately detained. While protesters say they were peaceful, police say rocks were hurled at them. Still, students' efforts continued last night, expanding outside of Montreal and Quebec City to smaller towns and featuring marchers clanging pots and pans, the Winnipeg Free Press reports.

"(Aug 8, 2017  3:22 PM CDT) In some ways, Rainbow Day Camp is very ordinary. Kids arrive with a packed lunch, make friendship bracelets, play basketball, sing songs, and get silly. But it is also unique, from the moment campers arrive each morning. At check-in each day, campers make a nametag with their pronoun of choice. Some opt for  she  or  he.  Or a combination of  she/he.  Or  they,  or no pronoun at all. Some change their name or pronouns daily, to see what feels right. The camp in the San Francisco Bay Area city of El Cerrito caters to transgender and  gender fluid  children ages 4 to 12, making it one of the only camps of its kind in the world open to preschoolers, experts say. Enrollment has tripled to about 60 young campers since it opened three summers ago, with kids coming from as far as Los Angeles, Washington, DC—even Africa, the AP reports. Plans are underway to open a branch next summer in Colorado, and the camp has been contacted by parents and organizations in Atlanta, Seattle, Louisiana, and elsewhere interested in setting up similar programs. Gender specialists say the camp's growth reflects what they are seeing in gender clinics nationwide: increasing numbers of children coming out as transgender at young ages. They credit the rise to greater openness and awareness of LGBT issues and parents tuning in earlier when a child shows signs of gender dysphoria, or distress about their gender.  A decade ago, this camp wouldn't have existed. Eventually, I do believe, it won't be so innovative,  camp founder Sandra Collins said.  I didn't know you could be transgender at a very young age.

Sadly, it's no joke. As Bloomberg explains, one such collector made $454,000 in a single year, most of it in bonuses for getting people to pay up. His boss, the CEO of Educational Credit Management Corp., makes than more than $1 million in salary, along with some sweet commuting perks. ECMC is one of about 30 such  guaranty agencies  that help the government run its student-loan program. When the agencies collect money from defaulted borrowers, they keep their own cut, and with so many students graduating with massive debt loads these days, business is booming. Things got so out of hand that ECMC last year cut back its bonus program to make it harder for collectors to make more than $150,000.

His ex-wife, however, says some of that money should instead be in her pockets. In a lawsuit, Janet Foisie explains she and Robert were married for 50 years before they opted to divorce in 2010. The couple agreed to split their assets and eventually did so; during the process, Robert stated he did not have  any offshore assets,  the lawsuit says.

Orbital ATK's cargo ship pulled up at the space station bearing 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research.  What a beautiful vehicle,  said Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, who used the station's big robot arm to grab the vessel. The capture occurred as the spacecraft soared 250 miles above Kyrgyzstan; Onishi likened it to the last 195 meters of a marathon. Last Monday's liftoff from Wallops Island was the first by an Antares rocket since a 2014 launch explosion. Orbital ATK redesigned its Antares rocket and rebuilt the pad. While the Antares was grounded, Virginia-based Orbital ATK kept the NASA supply chain open with deliveries from Cape Canaveral, Fla., using another company's rocket. NASA is paying Orbital ATK and SpaceX to stock the station, but now SpaceX is grounded, as it investigates why one of its Falcon rockets exploded in a massive fireball during launch pad testing on Sept. 1.

Israel's Antiquities Authority said Wednesday that an excavation exposed two houses with well-preserved remains and floors containing pottery vessels, flint tools, and a basalt bowl. Ronit Lupo, the authority's director of excavations, says the items are representative of the early Chalcolithic period, around 5,000BC.  Apart from the pottery, the fascinating flint finds attest to the livelihood of the local population in prehistoric times: small sickle blades for harvesting cereal crops, chisels and polished axes for building ... even a bead made of carnelian [a gemstone], indicating that jewelry was either made or imported,  Lupo says, per the Times of Israel. Similar developments have been found elsewhere in present-day Israel but not in Jerusalem. The site was discovered while authorities were doing roadwork in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat. The remains reportedly are up to 2,000 years older than other evidence of human settlements previously found in the area, the Times notes. Lupo says, per the AP, that this  is the first time we found architecture of this kind in Jerusalem itself,  noting that it points to  an established society, very well organized, with settlement, with cemeteries.

Gregory Hill was playing music in his garage on an afternoon in 2014 when a neighbor called the police to complain, the New York Times reports. Deputy Christopher Newman and another officer responded to the call and confronted 30-year-old Hill, a warehouse employee, in the garage of his Fort Pierce home. The police said Hill was holding a gun during the confrontation, and toxicology reports later concluded Hill was intoxicated at the time. After a less than two-minute encounter, the garage door (which had been opened for the deputies) was closed again and Newman shot at Hill through the door four times, striking him twice in the abdomen and once in the head. Hill was found dead inside the garage with an unloaded gun in his back pocket. The family filed a wrongful death suit and requested damages for the pain and suffering of Hill’s three children. Last week, a federal jury delivered a verdict that baffled them. It found Newman had not used excessive force, but that St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara had been negligent (due to Newman's actions)—but only minimally so. Specifically, the sheriff's office was found to be just 1% at fault for Hill's death, so the damages ($1 for funeral expenses and $1 for each child’s suffering) were reduced to 4 cents from $4. The family's lawyer says, due to Hill's intoxication, the judge will further reduce the award from 4 cents to nothing.  I don’t get it,  the family's lawyer tells the Times.

Following a judge's Wednesday ruling, a death certificate has been issued for Lord Lucan, who the New York Times recounts as  a dashing British aristocrat  last seen on Nov. 7, 1974—the day that his children's nanny was found dead, allegedly by his hand. The BBC recalls the crime: Sandra Rivett was beaten to death in the family's London home and her body left in the basement; Lord Lucan's estranged wife was also attacked but got away, fleeing to a neighboring pub and yelling  He’s in the house! He’s murdered the nanny!  per the Times. Lady Lucan named her then 39-year-old husband as the attacker, saying he had thought she was Rivett, reports USA Today. A June 1975 inquest named him as Rivett's murderer, except the man born Richard John Bingham was never officially seen again after that night; a car he had borrowed from a friend was later found, blood-stained and abandoned.

Just last Saturday came a story from an old gambling friend, who says he was told that the lord shot himself and had his body fed to a tiger.

The AP describes families waiting outside a local Air Force base for up to eight hours yesterday, then jostling  furiously  for one of the 125 seats on a departing plane headed for Mexico City.  It's probably one of the worst holidays I've ever been on,  says one tourist.  It wasn't really a holiday, more of an incarceration.  Meanwhile, the lack of electricity has left tourists without access to ATMs, reports Reuters, leaving many high and, er, dry.   I had to go to a pawn shop to leave some jewelry to get money to be able to eat and pay for accommodation,  says one visiting woman.  We came with just enough money for three days and now we have been here for five. ... I don't know what we'll do if they don't open the motorway soon.",Storm Maroons 40K Tourists in Acapulco
"(Apr 22, 2009  6:06 PM CDT) The Taliban are expanding their reach in Pakistan and are now perched about 70 miles from the capital of Islamabad. The militants, recently given control of the Swat Valley by the government, took over the neighboring Buner district last night. Hillary Clinton told a House panel today that the  Pakistani government is basically abdicating to the Taliban and to the extremists,  a development she said posed a  mortal threat  to US and world security, the New York Times reports. The unusually charged language may be a bid to rattle not only Pakistan's rulers but American lawmakers who might balk at providing aid for US efforts in the region, the Times notes. In the Buner district, meanwhile, Taliban militants entered from Swat and set up their headquarters after driving out government officials.

He says the deer had given up swimming and was being carried farther offshore, the AP reports. Dorr and his crew hauled the 100-pound buck aboard. Having a wild animal in a confined space could be trouble. But Dorr tells the Bangor Daily News that the deer was so tuckered out that he  laid right down like a dog.  He says it took a half-hour to return to Harrington, where the deer was set free. Dorr says that he has seen deer swimming before but that this was different.

Per FOX 5, GQ Covergirl, said to be a 5- or 6-year-old mare, hurt both front legs during training Friday, and the veterinarian on the scene said euthanizing the horse would be the best bet. This is the 35th horse death at the park since December. As for the human element, KABC reports Amir Cedeno is  physically OK but emotionally bruised  after GQ Covergirl's accident, per a statement from the stable that trained the horse.  If horse racing ever needed a three strikes rule, it's now,  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says in its own statement, adding the horse's trainer needs to be fully investigated.  When a horse dies, the California Horse Racing Board should suspend the trainer pending a full investigation. It won't bring back the horse, but it might prevent more deaths.  ABC News notes the changes that have taken place at the park in the wake of all of the horses that've died, including a law to suspend racing licenses.

Susan Silverman was there as part of  Women of the Wall,  a group campaigning for gender equality in religion.  They [police] said 'take off your prayer shawls', and we said 'no,'  and were escorted away after prayers ended, Silverman says.

British authorities and the FBI say they arrested alleged hacker  cracka  in England on Tuesday after information on 20,000 FBI employees and 9,000 Homeland Security agents surfaced online this week, reports CNN. He's a  16-year-old computer nerd,  one US official tells the network. In the past,  cracka  has allegedly hacked accounts linked to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, and the home phone of President Obama's science and technology adviser, per ABC News. The hacker has said in anonymous interviews that he works with a group called Crackas With Attitude, and conducts his attacks in support of Palestinians. Another member of the group identified as  Cubed  tells the Daily Dot that the goal was to have the US government cut ties with Israel. Asked why Crackas With Attitude backed the  Free Palestine  movement, he wrote:  We just support it. Its [sic] not right.  Officials say the arrest was hurried by the suspect's apparent access to a shared computer drive that held sensitive documents.

That's the case now. A research station at Esperanza, on the peninsula's northern edge, has recorded a temperature of 18.3C—64.94F. That's the highest temperature ever recorded on the continent. The outpost began keeping records in 1961, the Guardian reports. Antarctica's previous record was17.5C, reached in March 2015. A climate scientist found the jump of nearly a degree in only five years to be significant.  It's a sign of the warming that has been happening there that’s much faster than the global average,  he said. Thursday's high has not yet been confirmed by World Meteorological Organization, per CNBC, but the group said it appears to be legitimate.

In an early tweet, the president announced he is restoring tariffs on aluminum and steel shipped from Argentina and Brazil, reports the Wall Street Journal. Trump accused both countries of manipulating their currencies to hurt US farmers, and he paired his action with criticism of the Federal Reserve, notes Bloomberg, which sees the morning moves as significant. Trump says that by these and other nations deliberately devaluing their currencies,  this makes it very hard for our (manufacturers) & farmers to fairly export their goods,  he wrote.

Their bodies were found in a Lodi-area vineyard after someone reported that the skydivers hit the ground without an open parachute, San Joaquin County Sheriff's Deputy Les Garcia said. It appeared the parachute did not deploy until after impact, he said. Authorities were working to identify the bodies, but it appears the victims, both males, were in their 20s. They had jumped from the Parachute Center, a popular skydiving school in the state's Central Valley whose website declares it  one of the largest and oldest drop zones in the United States,  launched in 1964. Parachute Center owner Bill Dause told KCRA-TV the instructor in Saturday's deadly jump was an independent contractor who has made about 700 jumps.  The parachute failed to eject properly. We have no explanation why,  Dause said.  The only thing it looks like is something may have gone out of sequence (and) that may have caused the problem.  The website offers an introductory tandem jump with an instructor for $100, from 13,000 feet. The center has been in the news before. In May, a small plane carrying 17 skydivers took off from the Parachute Center and landed upside-down after clipping a pickup. The worst injuries were minor cuts and scrapes. And in February, the Lodi News-Sentinel reported that a solo skydiver had died after a parachute malfunction at the center.  I am always liable but I am not concerned. We didn’t do anything wrong,  Dause said.  It's a love of the sport. You keep going. You feel sorry for the people who can't participate any longer.

"(Apr 3, 2020  7:37 AM CDT) For the last 113 straight months, the first Friday of each month came with a question: How many new jobs were created over the previous 30 days? No more, thanks to the coronavirus. The epic streak came to an abrupt end with Friday's unemployment report for March, which shows that employers shed 701,000 jobs, per the AP. The unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 4.4%. Those numbers, however, don't even begin to reflect the true damage because the relevant surveys end in the middle of the month, notes the Wall Street Journal. Since then, nearly 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. By May, the US is projected to have lost 28 million jobs and have a jobless rate of 16%, which would wipe out all of the job gains over the last decade, per the Journal.
